Senior partner Tiffany Burns named one of the most influential executives in America by Savoy,The managing partner for the firm&rsquo;s Atlanta office reflects on how she shaped her consulting career into a force for inclusion.,2024-05-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/senior%20partner%20tiffany%20burns%20named%20one%20of%20the%20most%20influential%20executives%20in%20america%20by%20savoy/mckinsey-blog-savoydirectorsforum2024mckinsey-blog-savoydirectorsforum2024-hero-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Leadership Development",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/senior-partner-tiffany-burns-named-one-of-the-most-influential-executives-in-america-by-savoy,"Senior partner Tiffany Burns named one of the most influential executives in America by Savoy May 9, 2024 Savoy Magazine, a leading publication on African American lifestyle, culture, and business, recognized Tiffany Burns on its 2024 list of the most influential executives in corporate America. Composed of 300 Black executives who exemplify exceptional leadership, Savoy’s annual list honors the best in today’s talent from companies across industries, such as Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe’s Companies, and Scott Mills, president and CEO of BET Media Group. Tiffany joined McKinsey in 2010 and became senior partner and office managing partner for Atlanta in 2022. A leader in the firm’s global Consumer Practice, she serves organizations on broad transformation efforts to significantly increase performance. She has also had a major impact on the firm’s diversity and inclusion work, helping launch programs that have touched thousands. Here, she reflects on some of the milestones of her career. On mentorship and sponsorship I joined the firm in the Atlanta location; Atlanta was one of the most diverse locations in North America but still had no Black partners or senior partners at that time. I was lucky to have people like former Atlanta office managing partner Tom Barkin, who treated me like I really belonged, because without representation, sometimes you look around and you’re not so sure. There were also other senior partners in the office who sponsored me. They all set a high bar, pushed me to their level, and trusted me to deliver. There’s no better boot camp than working with people who are the best and make you rise to their level. In my current role, I’ve worked with my colleagues in Atlanta—such as partner Darius Bates , who leads the Atlanta chapter of our affinity group McKinsey Black Network—on ensuring that Black and other underrepresented colleagues have equitable access to mentorship and sponsorship, because it’s not a given. No one comes to the firm knowing how to be a McKinsey consultant, so it’s critical that all colleagues, including our diverse colleagues, have the opportunity to build these networks that will support them and provide good, direct feedback. When I became a senior partner along with Shelley Stewart III , we committed to keep the same intensity of focus to bring up the next generation of Black senior partners in North America. On creating the firm’s 10 actions toward racial equity in 2020 When George Floyd was murdered, I was pregnant with my first child. I thought, “This can’t be the world that my child is going to be living in.” My McKinsey colleagues and I knew that it was a moment where we could have an indelible impact on our firm and accelerate our long-held objectives to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion. It was a challenging and sad context, but our commitment to action was energizing. Over about two weeks, senior leaders across our firm met daily and asked how McKinsey could make a difference and what bold aspirations would look like for us. We wanted to help build capabilities for Black executives and asked ourselves what a McKinsey-level goal could be. We knew that if our aspiration wasn’t arduous, and if it didn’t make us uncomfortable, then we hadn’t hit the mark. This mentality led us to our ambitious 10 actions : double our number of Black leaders and colleagues hired, create the Institute for Black Economic Mobility and the Black Leadership Academy, boost our pro bono efforts, and more. We knew that if our aspiration wasn’t arduous, and if it didn’t make us uncomfortable, then we hadn’t hit the mark. At every turn, we had the firm’s support to make this happen, so we could dream big. It was a very fulfilling, once-in-a-lifetime moment. I am still amazed at how our full firm rose to the challenge to make something “only McKinsey” happen from inspiration to execution. On social change through consulting Early on, I worked with a Black founder who was sharp, charismatic, and inspiring and had scaled his business to close to a billion-dollar valuation. This made a tremendous impact on me because there aren’t many Black founders that have reached that level. A light bulb went off for me, about how the firm had the potential to make a real difference with these types of organizations. I’m very grateful that my work in leading transformations with retail and consumer companies has given me a platform to support greater equity for Black founders and Black consumers. Some of the most inspiring work that I’ve done at the firm was helping to architect Next 1B , a no-cost business accelerator that aims to help Black founders build the next generation of Black-owned brands. Making a difference was a true team effort of amazing McKinsey partners and colleagues: Tyler Rose, Pamela Brown, Jon McClain, Alexis Wolfer, John R. Moran, Sara Prince, Shelley Stewart III, Liz Pharis, Brooke Daniels, and Jalen Walker. We were sponsored by Eric Kutcher, Becca Coggins, and Sajal Kohli. I’ve also been able to work on some of the research and community-building efforts we’ve done in the Black beauty space. If you would’ve asked me when I started at McKinsey if I would be able to do the types of things I’m doing now, I wouldn’t have thought it was possible. But I’ve truly been able to “make my own McKinsey” over the past few years, both in client service and in helping to support diverse communities. I’m so happy about where I’ve been able to take my work, and the impact it’s made, and I’m excited to continue because there is still so much more to be done. related More than 700 new tech colleagues to join McKinsey in Atlanta Never miss a story","Tiffany Burns, a senior partner at McKinsey, was named one of America's most influential executives by Savoy Magazine.

McKinsey named a Leader in Cybersecurity Consulting Services by Forrester,"McKinsey was designated a Leader in cybersecurity consulting services, the highest ranking possible. This post explains what makes the firm&rsquo;s cybersecurity practice unique.",2024-05-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20named%20a%20leader%20in%20cybersecurity%20by%20forrester/forrestercybersec-hero-small-1480959457-1536x864.jpg,"Resilience,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-named-a-leader-in-cybersecurity-by-forrester,"McKinsey named a Leader in Cybersecurity Consulting Services by Forrester May 9, 2024 McKinsey has been recognized as a Leader in cybersecurity consulting services, the highest designation possible, in The Forrester Wave™: Cybersecurity Consulting Services, Q2 2024 report. Forrester evaluated 15 providers on 24 criteria. McKinsey received the highest score possible on 11 of these, including Cybersecurity strategy and vision delivery, and Customer retention and satisfaction. “Deep technology expertise matters most right now in this market,” according to the Forrester report, and our firm also ranked among the highest in the Use of emerging technologies in client delivery criterion. We recently caught up with Ida Kristensen , the McKinsey senior partner who leads our cybersecurity team and co-leads the Risk & Resilience Practice, to learn more about the work they do. What does this Forrester ranking of a ‘Leader’ in cybersecurity consulting services mean for you? We are incredibly proud of receiving this external recognition; for us, this is something to celebrate. It acknowledges what we have been hearing from our clients: that they value our unique ability to combine their strategic agenda—of their board, CEO, and executive management team—with our deep technical expertise. It wasn't always like this. The chief information security officer (CISO) within organizations used to be quite isolated. Management would say, “Thank you for doing your thing. We don't fully understand what you're doing, but good luck with it.” Now cybersecurity has become such a strategic imperative for institutions that all parties—from the CEO to the front lines—need to both inform and understand the strategy. It influences all aspects of a business: designing new products and services, upgrading technologies, managing supply chains and customers, and it’s a critical aspect of organizational transformations. Cybersecurity has become a business enabler, rather than a roadblock. Tell us more about McKinsey’s team In the past five years, our practice has undertaken some 570 projects across industries. We've tripled the size of our team to more than 240 cyber experts, many of whom are veterans from U.S. military and intelligence operations, and from the leadership and frontlines of cybersecurity organizations. Cybersecurity One thing that is unique from our usual practice is that our experts work across sectors, since cybersecurity isn’t industry specific. For example, they can credibly say to an industrial, tech or CPG client: “We should look at this new approach the financial services industry has been taking.” This makes them even better prepared to serve our clients. What work are you particularly proud of? We've served a number of clients who’ve experienced a very severe cyber-attack. We helped them restore operations, get back up on their feet, minimize the cost and implications from the attack, and used the opportunity to help them build greater resilience to move forward. And as terrible as it is, these crises can be a defining, learning moment. A second example at a micro level: we often conduct war games and tabletop exercises where there's this moment of revelation.  We recently did a three-hour ransomware exercise with a leader of a tech company. It was very fast paced and pulses were racing. As we were debriefing, the CEO said, “If this was real, I would now hand in my resignation because we were clearly not prepared for that.” He walked away knowing they would have to take a different approach. It was a small exercise, but the impact was profound, which makes me very proud. One of the interesting things is the human element…Ninety percent of all cyber-attacks start with a phishing attempt…it makes a big difference in all of us just getting wiser. How is gen AI impacting cybersecurity? It adds to the sophistication of the attacks. The ability to impersonate others, for example in creating very real videos, is leading to breaches of security. And the sophistication of phishing attempts has gone up wildly. The latest research shows that malicious phishing emails have increased 1,265% since the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Adversaries are now using gen AI to write emails that are much better. Companies are experiencing thousands of attacks on a daily basis.  In the past, it was just like throwing spaghetti against the wall—trying lot of different attacks to see which ones would go through. Now with gen AI, the attackers have an ability to learn as they go, seeing which ones are more effective, and updating the strategy in real time. Even if the volume doesn't go up, the success rate does. On the flip side, this same aspect of gen AI is helping companies learn in real-time which defenses and detections work best, so they can isolate attacks more quickly.  Companies are using gen AI to fight gen AI, if you will. Cyber risks are constantly changing. What makes you optimistic looking forward? We have evolved as a society to recognize this is a common problem. Significant resources from both public and private sectors are being invested, and different groups are collaborating to solve it. Governments are taking an active role and setting guidelines to protect security, privacy, and safety. One of the interesting things is the human element.  Ninety percent of all cyber-attacks start with a phishing attempt. Despite this being a very technical topic, a huge part of the defense is educating human beings. We've all obviously had the joys of the phishing exercises. But these things matter, right? If we educate everyone who has contact with this, it makes a big difference in all of us just getting wiser. related An inside look at how businesses are—or are not—managing AI risk Never miss a story","McKinsey has been recognized as a Leader in cybersecurity consulting services by Forrester, achieving the highest rating in 11 out of 24 criteria.

McKinsey Health Institute&nbsp;<span>helps caring adults support children affected by trauma</span>,McKinsey Health Institute partnered with Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital Medical Center and mental health organizations to create training for youth who have experienced trauma.,2024-05-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mhi%20helps%20educators%20support%20children%20affected%20by%20trauma/strongyouth-hero-small-1498436295-1536x864.jpg,Healthcare,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mhi-helps-educators-support-children-affected-by-trauma,"McKinsey Health Institute helps caring adults support children affected by trauma May 10, 2024 “One of my students was disruptive and making inappropriate comments.  I stayed calm and looked at the situation from his perspective: I had learned his mom didn’t want him back at home and he was living with his uncle. I was able to understand his behavior, and the principal and I worked to get him into the therapy program that he needed.” This is just one example of the difference that Strong Resilient Youth , a free, online program is making. The training, developed by the Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), helps educators and supportive adults develop the knowledge and skills for recognizing and responding to trauma in children. Support children and youth experiencing trauma The program is grounded in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) four Rs. Kana Enomoto ,  a partner and MHI’s director of brain health, explains the concept: “It doesn’t train people to treat trauma, but it trains them to realize that trauma is ubiquitous—and very common in how it affects people. Participants can recognize trauma when they see it, respond appropriately to a person exhibiting the signs of being traumatized, and then resist doing something that exacerbates the trauma.” The Strong Resilient Youth program was born out of concern about the mental health of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. When the world was going into lockdown and schools moved online, teachers had a view into the home lives of children they had previously only seen in the classroom. “We talked to a lot of experts who were concerned about the stress on families and how that may play out for kids with potential increases in domestic violence or incidents of child abuse,” explained Kana. “In one school district survey, parents reported being more concerned about mental health than loss of learning. And there was a strong desire at the McKinsey Health Institute to do something that was accessible for teachers who were now seeing a different side of their students’ lives.” McKinsey Health Institute It was designed to help educators recognize the signs of trauma and de-escalate situations to move forward in a more productive and healing fashion. “We have worked together with school systems, after-school programs, and others to create a training that is responsive to the needs of kids and staff,” says Dr. Bob Shapiro, Director of the Mayerson Center. A typical scenario that plays out in classrooms is when a child is acting out, the teacher tells them to be calm or sit down. The child responds negatively because they are distressed, and the situation escalates. Participants learn to give the child some space, realize what’s going on, and ask questions like: ‘Would it help you to sit outside for ten minutes? Can I have someone come talk to you?’ “This gives the child agency in the situation and helps him or her self-regulate. And then life goes on,” explains Kana.  “We don’t have to go to the principal’s office; we don’t create a disciplinary problem.” Over the next year, the MHI and CCHMC teams worked with mental health and children’s organizations to develop the training, which featured experts from around the world. Learning practitioners from McKinsey Academy helped develop the curriculum while McKinsey Digital colleagues managed the tech aspects of the project. Within a year, the training was rolled out to schools in the US Midwest. It’s the pebble that creates a lot of ripples. If in that first interaction we can handle the trauma appropriately, we prevent so many downstream consequences. Then the invasion of Ukraine happened, and the Czech Republic was receiving a significant influx of Ukrainian children who were being placed in local schools. Given the volume of need, the training was rolled out to educators and caring adults, such as coaches, bus drivers, and aid workers. Dr. Tamara Baer , a McKinsey associate partner and a practicing pediatrician who focuses on healthcare for vulnerable populations, recalled hearing from a Czech social worker that the training “helped me get a better understanding of people’s behavior, and it became obvious that most of [my adult clients] experienced trauma in their childhood. Now, I can see them in a different light, and I understand them better.” The program was translated into Czech, Ukrainian, and Spanish; and in the US it has been made available through the National Council for Mental Wellbeing to certified teen and Youth Mental Health First Aid Instructors. “Certification in the free Strong Resilient Youth training equips MHFA Instructors and other caring adults with additional tools to help children and youth build resiliency and positive coping strategies, as they gain a deeper understanding of how trauma manifests itself in communities,” says Tramaine EL-Amin, vice president, Mental Health First Aid. Erica Coe , global co-leader of MHI who helped establish the program, is most proud of the fact that people are experiencing the training as life-changing. “It’s the pebble that creates a lot of ripples,” she says. “If in that first interaction we can handle the trauma appropriately, we prevent so many downstream consequences.” related 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis The “Missing Billion”: creating health equity through data for people with disabilities Never miss a story","The McKinsey Health Institute's Strong Resilient Youth program trains educators and adults to recognize and respond to children's trauma, emphasizing appropriate interventions to foster resilience.

This builds on the long-standing alliance McKinsey has with Microsoft to drive impact together for clients. Gen AI enterprise use cases could yield $2.6 trillion  to 4.4 trillion in annual economic benefit. Additionally, integrating gen AI and other technologies into business activities could enable the automation of up to 70 percent of the work hours in today's global economy. This is a crucial opportunity for leaders to proactively transform their organizations. This alliance will help organizations harness the value of gen AI by bringing together Microsoft’s Copilot Studio with McKinsey's deep strategy, organizational, change management, digital and implementation expertise. This collaboration is part of McKinsey’s open ecosystem of leading gen AI innovators , which is led by the firm's AI consulting arm QuantumBlack. QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey The collaboration will offer an end-to-end transformation approach that will focus on helping businesses re-imagine their core workflows with Microsoft’s Copilot Studio, to ensure adoption of the tools and the new processes that workforces need to improve service quality, and enable growth and efficiency. McKinsey brings vast experience with over 7,000 tech experts, engineers, and data scientists who partner with over 500+ clients annually to build and deploy tech-enabled solutions. McKinsey will develop several lighthouse solutions, built on Copilot Studio, to help advance clients through the next phase of gen AI. Led by principles of Rewired: The McKinsey guide to outcompeting in the age of digital and AI , and McKinsey’s digital transformation roadmap , McKinsey will work with Microsoft to develop a playbook for the next generation of gen AI agents. “We are thrilled to collaborate with McKinsey and apply our Microsoft Copilot Studio capabilities towards helping businesses achieve their digital innovation goals with agents. This technology enables us to reshape business automation as we know it and will unlock significant transformation for organizations and their customers,”  says Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president, Business Applications & Platforms, Microsoft. The promise and the reality of gen AI agents in the enterprise Gen AI-enabled agents hold the promise of accelerating the automation of a very long tail of workflows that would otherwise require inordinate amounts of resources to implement. Microsoft’s new Copilot Studio Agents are a meaningful step towards accelerating enterprise adoption: “All of this means that gen AI agents are getting much closer to becoming true “virtual workers” that can both augment and automate enterprise services in all areas of the business, from HR to finance to customer service,” explains Lari Hämäläinen , a senior partner at McKinsey. Our research shows that 60 to70 percent of the work hours in today’s global economy could theoretically be automated by applying a wide variety of existing technology capabilities, including gen AI. For customer operations specifically, research shows more than $400 billion of potential value from gen AI is at stake. Gen AI agents are an important step towards this value creation. AI-powered Copilot agents can run end-to-end workflows in collaboration with human employees who can then focus on higher value-add activities. In addition, they can collaborate with each other just like teams who are managed by human supervisors. Businesses can achieve holistic end-to-end impact as AI-powered copilot agents function across historically siloed workflows to manage entire processes. “We are excited to work with Microsoft to help our clients rewire their businesses with the latest in AI and cloud technology. Our joint efforts will enable enterprises to serve their customers and employees more efficiently and effectively across enterprise solutions, ultimately driving growth and success,” states Rodney Zemmel , senior partner and global leader of McKinsey Digital. Organizations are excited about the power of gen AI in customer care. In a recent article , Jorge Amar , a McKinsey senior partner, notes the progress he has already started to see with clients. “Over the past year, we have seen a lot of successful pilots with gen AI agents helping to improve the customer service functions. For example, you could have a customer service agent who is on the phone with a customer and receives help in real-time from a dedicated gen AI agent that is, for instance, recommending the best knowledge article to refer to or what the best next steps are for the conversation.” Leaders have already started seeing the impacts gen AI agents can have on their business. In a recent McKinsey interview, Linda Yao, head of the AI Center of Excellence at Lenovo, said, “With our gen AI agents helping support customer service, we’re seeing double-digit productivity gains on call handling time. And we’re seeing incredible gains in other places too. We’re finding that marketing teams are cutting the time it takes to create a great pitch book by 90 percent.” McKinsey is committed to helping businesses evolve and innovate.

At a global agribusiness company planning an SAP S/4HANA transformation, Value Finder uncovered over $100 million in process-optimization opportunities. McKinsey and SAP worked with Brenntag to unlock business-process insights as the anchor point across its SAP S/4HANA journey and identified value potential five times compared to the original business case. A major chemicals company leveraged Value Finder to re-baseline its SAP S/4HANA business case, certify value capture with the board, and identify 10 to 15 percent potential incremental benefits in order-to-cash. The capability has also delivered impact at McKinsey. Following our recent SAP S/4HANA transformation, Value Finder was applied to compare process performance indicators against industry benchmarks. “ While some process performance indicators were at par or better, we were able to identify several meaningful opportunities to improve and unlock value in spend optimization and cash collection due to divergent S/4HANA process execution patterns ,” says Nitin Khapre , the director of finance, innovation, and technology who led the McKinsey technology transformation. “These are just a few real-world examples of the difference Value Finder is already making for our clients and within McKinsey,” says Darwin Deano , a McKinsey partner and architect of Generative Enterprise. “We are proud of what we’re helping them achieve, and they inspire us to do even more. We will continue to raise our ambitions and push this work farther to help business leaders prepare for future challenges and build true resilience: the ability to thrive in a world of relentless disruption.” “We are excited about the capabilities of Value Finder and the profound impact it has already had on our clients' transformation journeys,” says Rouven Morato, general manager and chief revenue officer SAP Signavio and SAP LeanIX. “This tool is a testament to our commitment to co-innovation and our focus on delivering sustainable value and impact through technology.” related McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation McKinsey and SAP join forces to maximize business transformation value through cloud solutions Never miss a story","McKinsey has launched Value Finder in collaboration with SAP, utilizing generative AI to optimize business processes and enhance productivity during SAP S/4HANA transformations.

But he was also troubled by the amount of good food that would go to waste. At one restaurant, Matt and fellow cooks threw out every romaine leaf to get to the last two baby leaves. And if those two weren’t facing each other, they couldn’t be plated and went in the trash. “I’m really inspired by practicality and execution. As I saw how much food was thrown away, I wondered if this fine dining precision existed in the emergency food space,” says Matt. “I quickly discovered that it didn’t and became obsessed with building a system that delivered food equitably and sustainably. I thought it was the most basic thing I could do—help take this food and ensure I can get it to somebody. Matt left the kitchen and founded Rethink Food in 2017 in New York City, a nonprofit working to bridge the gap between excess food and the communities that need it. It has since donated over 24 million meals and rescued over 2.4 million pounds of food from being wasted. What began as primarily a food rescue operation evolved into also providing small grants to restaurants to make meals for places like community centers and shelters. Historically, food is trucked into these facilities from large industrial kitchens outside New York City. Keeping food delivery local not only cuts down on emissions but supports neighborhood businesses and offers immigrant and ethnic communities food they know and like. “Instead of bringing in generic food from Pennsylvania to a senior center in Chinatown, we supported local restaurants to make the meals that match the needs and cultural preferences of the local community,” says Matt. “It just makes so much sense.” To scale this, Rethink Food would have to secure food contracts from New York City to provide meals at even more sites, such as schools. Could their model work on a large scale? That’s where McKinsey’s study came in. “We put the data behind Rethink Food’s thesis that this local-sourcing model has many benefits,” says Tejas Shah , a McKinsey partner in New York who led the pro bono team that conducted the study. The team developed a framework to compare and measure Rethink Food’s decentralized restaurant network to the centralized catering model by conducting a series of interviews and integrating insights from case studies and analyses to understand the impact of Rethink’s model and scaling potential. Having partnered with Rethink Food in 2020 to help respond to the major disruptions COVID-19 brought to restaurants and food systems in New York City, McKinsey believed in the organization’s model. “Rethink Food is pioneering a new way of addressing food insecurity that could potentially revolutionize how we solve this problem,” says Tejas. The study’s positive findings were exciting, but not surprising to the McKinsey team: the same dollar of funding for buying meals creates 50 percent more jobs through the Rethink model than the large-caterer model, and 75 percent of those jobs are local to New York City. “The city could be spending its food contract dollars on supporting local businesses and creating jobs,” says Tejas. “That’s quite significant.” The study also found that Rethink Food’s model delivers a higher share of funding to minority- or women-owned businesses, and the proportion of minority-identifying staff is more than 95 percent at Rethink Food restaurant partners. This diversity allows Rethink Food to offer culturally appropriate food, with 13 different cuisines on offer currently—though Matt has found that across cultures, “everyone likes pizza.” The study has been a major boon to Rethink Food, giving it a basis to talk to key stakeholders. It has helped secure contracts that have flowed $65 million to small business owners since the launch of the study. “We have restaurants calling every day wanting to work with us. All we need are the contracts and the funds,” says Matt. “The study is getting us there by showing that our model can be successfully scaled. That impact is huge.” related McKinsey co-founds effort to transform agriculture and food systems in Africa A relief effort accelerates and expands: The story behind 2.3 million saved meals Never miss a story","Matt Jozwiak founded Rethink Food in 2017 to address food waste by connecting excess food to communities in need.

It’s also when we reinforce our firm’s commitment to social mobility and socioeconomic diversity for the year ahead. As part of this commitment, we began hosting Student Insight Days in our London office in 2021, in partnership with education charity Into University. These events are more than just office tours; we invite local secondary-school students to step into the world of consulting. This offers underrepresented students the opportunity to explore potential careers and the core skills they require, helping them to make informed choices about how to shape their educational path. McKinsey in the United Kingdom During one of our recent Student Insight Days, we hosted 30 secondary students from North London. They met with our consultants, including the London office managing partner Tunde Olanrewaju , and took part in an innovation challenge to design a robot that benefits society. “Social mobility is central to our firm’s values, reflecting our commitment to being diverse and inclusive. We want everyone with the talent to join McKinsey to feel like they have the opportunity to succeed here, irrespective of their background,” says Philip Barber , a partner at McKinsey. “Almost every time we host these events, students tell us ‘This is a part of McKinsey I didn’t know existed.’  Just having them in the office is eye-opening both for us and them.” We hosted the event with our partner Into University, a UK-based charity that provides education programs for students facing disadvantage and barriers to progressing into higher education. Dr. Rachel Carr founded Into University when she was working with young people at a community center. “I started thinking about what I could do to support them. They’re amazing students—bright, smart, and capable—who just need a little bit of extra help to achieve their fantastic potential.” What began as a small project with 75 students has grown into a UK-wide organization that works with over 50,000 young people and 372 partner schools. “We’ve been very strategic about going where we are most needed,” Rachel states . “Our centers are based right where young people are— in coastal areas, post-industrial towns, as well as urban locations—basically wherever there’s a need.” These efforts are facilitated by Prism (Progressing Representation and Inclusion in Social Mobility), McKinsey’s internal community of colleagues passionate about the topic. It was formed in 2019 in the UK and is now active throughout Europe and beyond. Prism is open to all colleagues, and members come from a variety of backgrounds—including colleagues who are the first generation in their family to attend university, those who grew up in low-income or financially insecure households, and allies. Prism Prism members build connections through speaker and community events and volunteer their time to support our recruitment, retention, and outreach activities. In the London office, Prism also hosts events, including with schools, and through client roundtables, to engage leaders on their thinking in the social mobility space. As Peter Cooper , an associate partner at McKinsey says, “Every single year we grow in size, passion, and commitment. I don’t think there’s been a moment in the past five years where it’s felt like we’re slowing down.” As for what’s next in our work on social mobility, we’re planning to bring more insights to clients on economic diversity and how they can foster more inclusive organizations—including a report on social mobility for employers. “If young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not able to access certain careers or industries, then frankly we’re missing a huge amount of talent and not doing all we should be doing for society,” says Philip. “That’s why we’re so excited to continue bringing young people in to learn about our firm and profession.” related Making a $30 million commitment to address global unemployment “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce Never miss a story","McKinsey is committed to enhancing social mobility in the UK through initiatives like Student Insight Days with Into University, offering disadvantaged students career insights and skills.

McKinsey accelerates gen AI value creation with Iguazio,"McKinsey’s Iguazio platform offers enterprises a consolidated, software-based approach to build, implement, scale, and govern gen AI solutions.",2024-06-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-accelerates-gen-ai-value-creation-with-iguazio,"McKinsey accelerates gen AI value creation with Iguazio June 18, 2024 It’s been 18 months since OpenAI launched Chat GPT, immediately unleashing a wave of curiosity and experimentation. This work has paid off; early users understand the balance between generative AI’s (gen AI) benefits and limitations, and the infrastructure and skills required. About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey Yet the short history of gen AI also chronicles countless pilot projects that stalled because they lacked structure and purpose and failed to deliver desired results. Moreover, some implementations of gen AI tools such as chat bots and virtual agents have produced embarrassing—and even dangerous—results. Ambitious leaders are eager to move beyond the “thousand flowers bloom” phase of gen AI. In short, they want to put more science into their data science. Enter Iguazio , a leading AI and machine learning operations company acquired by McKinsey in 2023. Since its acquisition, Iguazio has been integrated into QuantumBlack , McKinsey’s AI arm, dedicated to driving innovation and experimentation in AI. Iguazio offers a software-based AI platform grounded in data science principles to help organizations develop, deploy, and manage gen AI solutions. McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology The platform—part of QuantumBlack Horizon , McKinsey’s suite of AI development tools— addresses enterprises’ two biggest challenges when advancing from gen AI proofs of concept to live implementations within business environments. These are: “Gen AI made it easier to build POCs (proofs of concept), but much harder to move them to production, widening the gap between potential and actual business value,” said Asaf Somekh , co-founder and CEO of Iguazio. “With the Iguazio AI platform, we bridge that gap, helping organizations embed gen AI efficiently into their business processes and applications.” Used separately or as part of McKinsey’s growing catalog of solutions designed to address function- and industry-specific use cases, the underlying architecture of the Iguazio platform facilitates gen AI adoption. For example, the platform promotes the efficient use of infrastructure such as cloud services and computing power by automating many tasks for engineers. Likewise, AI infrastructure components such as Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) can be shared across projects, helping keep costs down and make the most efficient use of resources. Code written to extract data could be converted into managed microservices and reusable components to support a wide range of data extraction processes across the enterprise. McKinsey launches new product suite to help clients scale AI As organizations expand their reliance on Iguazio, additional benefits become apparent, including, for example, the ability to orchestrate and unify the data science process across teams, and centrally integrate and manage data from different sources. The Iguazio AI platform is versatile and can be deployed on-premises and in public, private, and hybrid configurations; includes advanced data lineage, tracking, and privacy features required in highly regulated industries such as financial services and telecommunications; and can be used with a range of large language models. “When McKinsey acquired Iguazio last year, we did it knowing we could quickly integrate its offering into our core QuantumBlack technology to the benefit of enterprises interested in building out robust—and safe—gen AI functionality,” said Ben Ellencweig , a senior partner. “The combination of Iguazio’s platform, McKinsey’s strategy and consulting expertise, and our gen AI ecosystem of tech partners provides the full range of solutions for our clients as they harness the power of gen AI. If 2023 focused on gen AI pilots and experimentation, 2024 is all about production at scale, and Iguazio plays a critical role in achieving that.” To ensure the responsible use of gen AI, the Iguazio platform has built-in guardrails at each stage of development  to help forestall risks such as data breaches, biased results, AI hallucinations, and intellectual property infringements. The platform also supports an effective governance framework. As leaders turn to McKinsey to create measurable and sustained business value from gen AI, they may look back on the early days with a sense of accomplishment at how far they’ve come, even as other companies continue to struggle to get out of the gates. related McKinsey and NVIDIA help industry leaders harness the power of generative AI Never miss a story","McKinsey, through its acquisition of Iguazio, aims to enhance generative AI implementation by bridging the gap between proof of concepts and live business applications.

"“There is no finish line, only continuous improvement”: Responsible practices at McKinsey","Daniel Trujillo, McKinsey’s chief ethics and compliance officer, discusses our approach to building trust and putting our values into practice.",2024-06-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/there%20is%20no%20finish%20line%20only%20continuous%20improvement%20a%20look%20at%20mckinseys%20approach%20to%20responsible%20practices/danieltrujillo-hero-small-daniel-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Resilience",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/there-is-no-finish-line-only-continuous-improvement-responsible-practices-at-mckinsey,"“There is no finish line, only continuous improvement”: Responsible practices at McKinsey June 20, 2024 Our 2023 ESG report details our aspirations, efforts, and progress toward delivering sustainable and inclusive growth—everything from creating jobs to cutting emissions. It also discusses our responsible practices—the high professional and ethical standards we use to govern our firm. We understand that without a dedication to responsible practices, our commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth isn’t possible. That’s why, since 2018, we’ve spent nearly $1 billion on building, enhancing, and operating a globally integrated risk, ethics, and compliance framework and culture. Daniel Trujillo , partner and chief ethics and compliance officer based in Austin, Texas, joined our firm in October of 2021 and has 32 years of experience in the field. Here, he describes our approach to operating responsibly and living our values. 2023 ESG Report Why did you choose to come to McKinsey? McKinsey has such a global footprint, and an opportunity to have an impact at that scale is exciting—and rare. I knew I’d be able to make a difference here from my interview process. When our current Global Managing Partner Bob Sternfels mentioned to me how important it was for him to continue improving our approach to ethics, compliance, and risk management, I asked, “Is the firm willing to make sacrifices to continue that journey?” For example, it could require time, shifting focus, or money. The conversations I had with firm leaders showed me that the organization prioritizes ethics and responsible practices. Often, companies have to slow down to get stronger before they can speed up. That’s been the case here, taking time to make changes and new investments—such as doubling our legal team and significantly increasing the size of our risk team. What is your approach to strengthening ethics and compliance? We organize our work into five building blocks that I think of as a wheel to be cycled through. The building blocks are: leadership (ensuring the appropriate resources, tone from the top/middle, accountability, and incentives), risk management (following proper enterprise risk management and annual risk assessments), governance (having clear and accessible rules based on values), training and education, and monitoring and response (to ensure we have a continuous improvement mindset). All of these involve changing human behavior and further enhancing culture—that takes time and perseverance. We work our way through the cycle, learn lessons, and then repeat. After several times around the wheel, the culture has been strengthened. What is your implementation strategy? This work has three pillars: people, process, and technology. We have amazing people at McKinsey, but I learned many years ago that having great people is not enough. More is needed: the right people have to work in tandem with the right processes and the right technology. We need clear, actionable guidelines paired with easy-to-use tools so our people have the seamless support they need. What is an improvement you’ve observed that showed you were on the right track? People come to us asking a simple question before starting client work: what could go wrong? After going through our education and training process, people question what work we should be doing, because not everything is right for us and our values. We want our colleagues to think not only about what we can do but also about what we should do. They’re proactively thinking about scenarios that could challenge how we uphold our values and strategizing if and how to proceed. That’s organizational growth. We want our colleagues to think not only about what we can do but also about what we should do. When you have that level of maturity, of understanding the difference between the can and the should , then you’re better prepared to grow, because you’re leaner and smarter. That’s slowing down so you can speed up. How are you thinking about the future of this work? I’m inspired by the way our firm continues to learn, grow, and improve. Our firm truly understands that there is no finish line for this work, only continuous improvement, which makes me very proud to be here. So, we’re going to keep pressing stop and asking, “What are we missing here? What do we need to do to ensure that we are generating a positive impact?” We aim to build the trust of our clients, colleagues, and society. And we’ll keep going around the “wheel” and earning that trust as we work towards the next hundred years of our firm. related With gen AI, helping green businesses strengthen our ‘blue economy’ McKinsey’s work to bolster HBCUs brings recognition from the White House Never miss a story","McKinsey's 2023 ESG report emphasizes continuous improvement in responsible practices and sustainable growth, backed by significant investments in ethics, compliance, and risk management.

These 20+ products and over 140 use cases combine advanced AI and machine learning techniques with domain-specific expertise to solve today’s most challenging business problems across a spectrum of industries, including Life Sciences, Retail, Mining, and Financial Services. They represent the very latest in AI capabilities and incorporate deep industry expertise, developed from almost a century of serving clients around the world. Our R&D team, QuantumBlack Labs, with 200 software engineers, designers, product managers, and data scientists, has collaborated with over 1000 industry and functional practitioners, to build these AI products. They were developed using our Horizon platform, which incorporates best practices and risk guardrails for security, privacy and resilience. “These products codify knowledge gained through on-the-ground consulting and transformation programs—thousands of projects over eight years. We have infused this insight into the latest AI models, software, and tooling,” says Matt Fitzpatrick , a McKinsey senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack Labs. “Now clients can benefit from deep industry expertise in the form of leading-edge AI models, running on proven technology, along with the change management to ensure that new ways of working are adopted throughout the organization.” These high-impact solutions can help organizations move quickly while building capabilities for long-term success. “We have invested significantly in developing a technology approach that allows these products be deployed in three distinct ways, to whatever our clients need,” says Rory Walsh , a distinguished engineer at QuantumBlack. There are three deployment models available: QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey Metals & Mining Case study: Metals & Mining A major copper concentrate producer was struggling to run grinding mills at their ideal capacity and to achieve top-decile recovery performance. The challenges were driven by the plant’s complex operations, where thousands of sensors were fed into a control system to solve for non-linear functions and trade-offs. QuantumBlack deployed OptimusAI to build an AI model that could use operating data to identify optimization opportunities to boost copper production at consistent quality. As a result, the plant improved throughput by a range of 10 to 15 percent, and copper recovery in a range of two to four percentage points. One of the core assets is OptimusAI, an industry-leading product for optimizing performance to transform plant productivity and decision-making in the production of materials, food, and energy. It incorporates our expertise in process manufacturing and applies cutting-edge machine learning techniques to unlock capacity, reduce emissions, and boost quality, and additionally offers configurable dashboards to improve industrial processes.  A proprietary control-room advisor application was designed to optimize performance in the context of thousands of variables, presenting a straightforward user interface to offer optimization recommendations. “Capturing value from artificial intelligence requires multiple skillsets, and at any point in time, our client engagements require similar toolkits,” says Alexander Sukharevsky , senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack. “With QuantumBlack Labs, we created a center of excellence and learning that codifies domain knowledge into reusable assets that can be deployed into client environments and unlock new scales of impact. Today, this end-to-end AI tech and service stack, including 20+ products across data, infrastructure, tooling and sector-specific use cases, reduces time and cost to develop AI capabilities.” Life Sciences Our core Life Sciences product leverages AI and analytics to serve leading pharma and medtech clients. As new types of clinical and scientific datasets have become available, along with new generative and predictive models, and ever greater computing power to run them, the product has changed the research paradigm by embedding scientific AI into all the core processes. AI is a powerful lever to transform how Life Sciences can improve the probability of success and increase productivity. QuantumBlack’s AI-powered transformations unlock order-of-magnitude acceleration in research and improved drug candidate efficiency, enabling new molecule entry into the clinic within 6 months of deploying our machine learning model for molecule design. Our goal is to accelerate the drug development timeline by one to two years, from discovering endpoints to gaining approval.  QuantumBlack’s AI products are steered from within by practitioners with expertise in data science and deep domain knowledge of biological and clinical science. “We recruit PhDs, doctors and practitioners in medicine who have been on the ground with patients and know the IT systems. They understand the nuances of data capture and of patient journeys,” explains Bhavik Shah , a McKinsey partner. “On the biological side, we have people who've generated and worked with the raw data in the lab and, so they know the value and the limitations which is really important in understanding the biases and gaps.” Insurance QuantumBlack’s work in insurance steers the delivery of AI use cases into transformation projects using reusable code components and use cases, built to production-grade standards for easier scaling. Client teams benefit through accelerated timelines, with pilots deployed in just a few weeks that deliver greater impact, through codified best practices and know how. Case study: Insurance A leading global insurer sought to fundamentally reimagine claims processing in a competitive European market. QuantumBlack’s technologists, along with input from our insurance experts, deployed use cases to augment intelligent decision-making across the claims value chain. The insurer was able to establish new analytics capabilities, building a series of reusable data assets by consolidating internal and external data and establishing additional safeguards around the deployment of AI-related risk and fairness standards. In one aspect of claims management, the time spent on processing claims was reduced by up to 50 percent through use of an AI agent to guide claims handlers in call triage and onward processing. “We have been tirelessly iterating on the technical foundations of our industry solutions, which can create impact and transform any business, in any industry. Today is an exciting moment in the firm’s history,” says Matt. “We will always be a management consulting firm, but we’re also a technology company.” To learn more about what QuantumBlack’s AI products can do for your enterprise and to request a demo, please e-mail Marc Solomon .  You can subscribe to the New at McKinsey blog for updates to QuantumBlack Labs. related McKinsey’s ecosystem of strategic alliances brings the power of generative AI to clients McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology Never miss a story","McKinsey has launched over 20 industry-specific AI products via QuantumBlack, integrating advanced AI techniques with domain expertise to address various business challenges.

Looking to improve productivity?

Think small. June 26, 2024 For many people, small business is a part of their everyday life: the corner bodega, the dog walker, the food truck, the plumber. In the US, people trust small businesses more than any other institution. “They are the one thing, literally, that we interact with every single day, and they make a big difference to the lives of people,” explains Anu Madgavkar , an MGI partner. This week, as the United Nations marks Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day on June 27 , we look at the McKinsey Global Institute’s (MGI) first-time report on this small, but mighty, business sector. Our analysis ranges from sole proprietors to mid-size companies of 200+ employees. It goes broad, spanning 16 countries, and deep, covering 200 plus subsectors. In this post, Anu, Kanmani “KC” Chockalingam , an MGI fellow, and María Jesús Ramírez Larraín , a McKinsey associate partner, share what they learned from their research. What prompted MGI to focus on this sector now? Anu :  Productivity, for us, is an important research theme and small businesses are a powerful force.  They account for more than 90 percent of all businesses, roughly half of the global GDP, and more than two-thirds of business employment. They form the backbone of many economies. But micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) are only half as productive as large companies, and even less so in emerging economies. If we can raise their productivity to top-quartile levels relative to large companies, that is equal to 5 percent of GDP in advanced economies and 10 percent in emerging economies. They have an important role to play in long term prosperity, resilience, and growth. You can't really lift productivity systematically unless you take the MSME sector with you. A microscope on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to boost productivity What was your key takeaway from the findings? María : For me, a very powerful idea is the fact that creating and increasing these linkages between small and large companies is actually a win-win situation. A lot of large companies would think about it as a bit of a philanthropic act: “You're doing it from the goodness of your heart.”  But actually no. There's a true business case for working with smaller companies.  You reduce the risk in your supply chain; small companies have local insight and resources; greater flexibility; and access to certain skills.  That's incredibly powerful. KC : The granularity of the data allowed us to see the incredible complexity of the MSME sector across countries you would think are similar. It also highlighted opportunities to improve productivity. For example, in Mexico, the sector is about food products, whereas in Brazil, it's chemicals; in India, the information and communications sector (ICT) could potentially drive up productivity, whereas in Indonesia, it's construction. With such a complicated landscape, is there a universal formula to lift productivity? Anu : More than a set formula, there are universal principles. One of them is to think about: which intangible is really the critical one? Is it capital? Is it technology?  Skills? Access to global markets? Because each business is quite different in terms of these things. The second is really being thoughtful about the power of those networks. Because almost nowhere is it the case that small businesses can flourish without very meaningful relationships with productive larger businesses. Sometimes they are highly functioning as collectives of small businesses: that is, with each other. But often, they are interacting with a larger company, as a consumer or a buyer. But understanding those kinds of networks is, I think, the most powerful idea that came from this research. What actions can leaders take to “lift up” the small business sector? María : From the perspective of associations, policymakers and large companies, there's a lot you can do. It's basically a combination of better access to the intangibles Anu talked about. Leaders should focus on creating the “economic fabric” where both MSMEs and large companies can perform well. For example, in Japan, large automakers have a history of tight integration with smaller suppliers, and very much live by the credo “we're in this together. ” It provides them with access to talent, operational efficiencies, and leading-edge technology. They are intertwined, and highly productive together. KC : We found a number of these win-win examples, each with a different formula. The Italian government provides its winemakers, generally smaller family-owned enterprises, with centralized branding and marketing resources for access to the international market. They can command premium prices, and a highly networked industry association gives them a powerful voice. In Australia, the government has fostered a high rate of public and private partnerships between small and large companies in specialized construction, especially mining. This enables them to be highly productive in a remote, harsh environment—they’ve streamlined red tape, and provide strong vocational training. Do small businesses stay small forever? Anu :  Some do, yes…but when we looked at the data over a 15-year period we found that almost 19 percent of all the largest companies actually started as small businesses. So this gives us a sense of how things evolve. The other trend which is really important is that at some point, less-productive firms will exit. Small businesses that are uncompetitive will down their shutters, or merge with others.

AIDS was still a huge question at the time and the corporate world was also absorbing the challenge of equal benefits and, eventually, equal marriage ,” recalls Brian Rolfes , a former partner at McKinsey who recently retired after nearly 30 years of serving clients and leading talent and diversity initiatives. “The silver lining was that we had this great community, including our families and allies, step up and say, ‘No, no, this has to change…' We were seeing that desire for change and activism surface in corporate life. And we learned we could broaden this to other regions around the world.” The network was first called the Gay and Lesbian Interest Group or GLIG. “Someone in the group sent out a note saying, “This is ridiculous. We should be a little bit more fabulous than GLIG… so we became GLAM,” laughs Brian. “We obviously needed to be more inclusive of all of our LGBQ and trans colleagues, which is why we have adopted Equal at McKinsey .” Over the next 25 years, Equal at McKinsey's early mission of support expanded to include recruiting, mentorship, global conferences, learning programs, pro bono work, and research initiatives. The community welcomes people of all orientations, gender expressions, and gender identities.

New McKinsey book explores how CEOs learn to lead,Most leaders say they feel unprepared for the CEO role.

While many leadership books highlight external capabilities, this title looks inward…to the psychological traits required to lead in a turbulent, increasingly complex world. The CEOs of the 2,000 largest organizations alone employ 70 million people. In a global survey, 83% of them said they felt unprepared for the job. Many are leaving sooner: the average CEO tenure has shrunk from six years to five. The Journey of Leadership aims to codify some of the internal processes and psychological and emotional growth necessary to achieve success as an individual and as a leader. The Journey of Leadership The book offers examples of a CEO who learns how to trust; one who makes mistakes and has to live with them; another who overcomes her feelings of being an “imposter.” Many of these stories have been shared by participants of our own Bower Forum , McKinsey's longest-running leadership development program. “We've been counseling CEOs, helping them become fully realized for over a decade through this program. We help CEOs crystallize their mandates, reflect on key challenges, and work with peers on a few ideas that can effectively address these challenges,” observes Ramesh Srinivasan , a McKinsey senior partner who along with Hans-Werner Kaas , senior partner emeritus, is a co-dean of the Bower Forum. Each forum is small, a group of about ten people from very diverse backgrounds. Three to four are active CEOs, along with their McKinsey partners, and the faculty is comprised of a McKinsey senior partner and one or two former CEOs/Chairs. “There are no slides, no tracking, no data; the agenda is determined by the participants,” explains Santiago Raymond , who has managed the program for a decade. About 20 in-person workshops take place around the world every year. More than 520 leaders have participated in some 145 Bower Forums to date. Unlike many programs which assemble groups of similar attendees, it draws from different industries, geographies, and tenures, which helps to create a sense of anonymity in the room and richness of perspectives. “This allows people to speak more candidly,” says Santiago. “But the idea is that the participants are peers, so they understand what the life is like; the sacrifices they make; the demands on time; the stresses of conflict and crises. They know the impact it can have on them, their families, friends, and society.” The two-day meeting starts with getting to know each other, their context, and the topics they want to bring to the table, along with their McKinsey partner. The faculty then share their own experiences: their North Star, their legacies, what they wish they had known or would have done differently. The agenda includes a deep immersion module when the participants are in listening-and-reflection mode, and their reinvention starts based on feedback they have received. Some participants develop plans with specific commitments on how they will lead themselves, their executive teams, and broader organizations, a tangible outcome of the Forum. The only training for being a CEO is being a CEO. “A lot of times, the discussions tend to be around relationships: with the team, with the environment, with the board, the organization. It’s a combination of self-discovery and hearing different perspectives,” says Ramesh. “But at the end, the participating CEOs choose the topics, changing from program to program .” The Journey of Leadership includes the story of the CEO of an Asian tech giant who attended the Bower Forum and realized that he needed guidance in managing a complicated, somewhat rivalrous relationship with his chairman, also his mentor. It was impeding him from undertaking significant changes to the company. After much self-assessment, he became more open and humble, and recognized he needed to become a better listener. He sought input from his management team, outsiders, and the board. He had been trying to go it alone, but after feedback from the other CEOs, he realized that he is not always expected to be ‘the smartest one in the room. ’ This gave him permission to ask for help. Some CEOs experience the imposter syndrome, feeling they don't belong because they lack a certain expertise or background. At the Bower Forum, one executive learned that he had to move beyond his internal, personal insecurities and focus outwardly on his goals for a bold transformation, starting with assembling the right team. It ’ s the kind of message that resonated when he heard it from his own peers. “The only training for being a CEO is being a CEO,” observed Marvin Bower, McKinsey’s longest-serving global managing partner, who alongside James O. McKinsey defined the foundations of the firm in the twentieth century. “What we are saying then is here is a program where we're going to share our own experiences and insights,” observes Hans-Werner, “to become better leaders and human beings, making a significant step towards reinventing ourselves.” related One book.

We talked to Bryan and Emily about how this pivotal organizational role has been changing over the past year. We are well-known advisors to the C-suite. How have we also been working with companies to rethink middle manager roles? Emily: The companies that are doing this right—and we’re getting to help them—are thinking about it not as, “We need to send our managers to training,” but actually, “We need to rethink our manager operating system.” They are asking questions like: how do we first create space so our managers have time to think critically, to focus on developing their own skills, and to coach their teams? What administrative work can we eliminate? What technologies can we use to automate some of the work? How do we build resiliency habits? Let’s face it: a manager’s job is incredibly hard: their spans are becoming larger, the personnel situations they have to navigate are more complicated, and they’re having to execute and deliver on business objectives in constrained environments as organizations cut costs. Power to the Middle What does an effective manager look like today? Bryan: Managers need to be able to do four things particularly well. They need to connect what the team is being asked to do to the broader “why.” This “sense-making” aspect is incredibly important. They empower their people: give them the context, guidance, and the confidence to do their job, and not micro-manage. At the same time, they challenge their team members to meet a high standard of performance—and to do more than they thought possible. A great manager is an inspiring, honest, and empathic coach—and not just a process-oriented taskmaster. They need to be able to build productive collaboration within and across teams—including fostering connectivity across many different forms of colleagues, including those working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and gig workers. They need to connect with divisions across the company, such as tech and support functions. They also need to understand the whole person—including the career and outside-of-work priorities of their team members—and provide empathetic and honest counsel on how to balance competing priorities. They need to recognize team members who may be struggling and guide them to supports which may be available. How has gen AI been re-shaping this role? Emily: We are seeing companies starting to use AI to improve their managers’ skills while they are in the flow of work. One organization is building in an AI-bot system of nudges to help their people better manage their work/life balance. For example, it asks ‘can you combine these meetings to be home on time?’ The same approach is being used to develop resilience: to guide teams to pause and take moment to re-calibrate their reactions to moments of stress such as a customer service crisis, or a tightened deadline, instances which will be a constant in their work life. Bryan: In addition to improving skills, gen AI is giving time back to managers. It is helping managers more rapidly complete the first drafts of their individual contributor work; alleviating administrative burdens, such as auto-filling required HR forms; and helping manage meetings and email via copilots which can summarize meetings and email threads and highlight areas for action. Gen AI-enabled tools are freeing managers to spend more time coaching team members, building relationships, and thinking critically about the most important problems. Where do you see middle management roles in two years? Emily: My hope would be that people can say proudly: “I am a middle manager because that’s a great place to be; I’m able to have impact, I have the space in my day to develop my people, which is was what gives me energy, and that is why I do my job.” And, if not, that’s okay. Companies are recognizing that not everyone wants to be a manager, and it shouldn’t be the only track for advancement. Companies are creating dual tracks: one for managers, one for knowledge experts. You don’t have to become a manager to advance; you can just be really good at what you do. Your expertise is your source of renewal and growth. And this dual-track approach can create an organization that is able to execute and thrive. related New McKinsey book explores how CEOs learn to lead Generative AI can give you “superpowers,” new McKinsey research finds","McKinsey emphasizes the importance of middle managers in organizational success, advocating for their development and support post-pandemic.

McKinsey program supporting return from leave recognized by WEF,"McKinsey&rsquo;s unique reboarding program has been successful in lowering attrition rates for those taking leave, the majority of whom are new mothers.",2024-02-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20firm%20has%20my%20back%20mckinsey%20program%20supporting%20return%20from%20leave%20named%20a%20lighthouse%20by%20wef/reboarding-hero-small-kristina-1536x864.jpg,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-program-supporting-return-from-leave-named-a-lighthouse-by-wef,"McKinsey program supporting return from leave recognized by WEF Kristina Müller with her son, Lukas. February 7, 2024 María del Mar Martinez, chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer at McKinsey, had three children during her time at the firm, the first as an associate partner and the second and third as partner. While they were joyous times in her life, they also raised professional challenges. “Those years were some of my toughest at the firm,” says María. “Re-engaging was always somewhat of a shock.” María helped lead an effort at the firm to support new parents, and others taking more than 12 weeks of leave, aimed at reducing attrition rates and improving their overall experience at work. The reboarding program launched in 2019 in Europe as a two-year pilot and reduced attrition by 20 percent, drawing over 1,100 participants. In 2023, the program expanded to all McKinsey offices. With this program, María sees a paradigm shift at the firm from her early motherhood days. “McKinsey is a place for having kids and a successful career.  Our reboarding program brings parents back from leave into a supportive, thriving environment,” she says. The program was recently recognized by the World Economic Forum as a diversity, equity and inclusion 'Lighthouse' in 2023, part of a broader effort to recognize companies’ DEI initiatives that McKinsey helped launch in 2022 . Germany-based McKinsey associate partner Kristina Müller recently used the program and shares her experience with its five components. McKinsey is a place for having kids and a successful career. A customized reintegration plan Kristina: I was on leave for 10 months after having my first child, Lukas. I was uneasy about being gone for that long and what I’d face when I returned. But this changed when the firm helped me form a plan for reboarding before I went on leave. I determined I wanted to return part time at 70 percent, and I connected with mentors and sponsors to talk this through. These same people were there to guide my reintegration. Individual parental coaching Kristina: The firm provided an incredible parental coach. It was someone external, which made me very comfortable speaking about all my fears and challenges, but the coach also had counseled others in the firm and knew how it worked. I had conversations with her every few weeks to discuss what was on my plate, tips about working part time, about prioritizing, and about being a mom in this challenging environment. She helped me determine my support system and how I’d coordinate care and manage my time. Facilitating the return In general, I felt like the firm would help me with whatever I might need. Kristina: The first step to coming back is getting staffed on a project. Being gone shrinks your network, and I was part time which could make things complicated for a team. To solve for this, the firm offered extra staffing for teams I joined, a resource available for six months. Adding a person to the team helped me focus on my baby and made me feel cared for. My incredible colleagues were what I missed most when I was on leave, and they were there for me when I returned. Specially calibrated performance evaluations Kristina: When I took leave, I was an engagement manager, but not long after I returned, I was promoted to associate partner, even while working at 70 percent. It was very helpful to know that in my first performance review upon return would be conducted with the leave in mind, offering helpful feedback but not letting my new situation be a factor in my performance rating. This removed a huge potential stressor. World-class broader parental supports Kristina: The firm was proactive and reached out to me to remind me childcare reimbursement was available. Using it was a very simple process. There are always times when your system fails, someone gets sick, the daycare might close, really anything can throw it off. There was also an allowance of days I could access emergency childcare, such as hiring a babysitter, if I needed a short-term solution. It was great to know it was there. In general, I felt like the firm would help me with whatever I might need.  Early on in my return, I had a Zoom call, and I didn’t have childcare.  I had my baby on my chest and I was bouncing him gently so he wouldn’t wake up. I tried to tilt the camera high so participants couldn’t see him. I felt uneasy at first. But I made it through because I knew the firm has my back. It’s all good—I’m a working mom. related McKinsey’s new parental leave program supports inclusive career advancement Never miss a story","McKinsey's reboarding program, launched in 2019, supports new parents returning from extended leave, reducing attrition by 20%.

February 26, 2024 When McKinsey partner Ryan Golden began working to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), she never thought that three years later, she’d win an award from the White House and meet with President Joseph R. Biden. “When we first started this work, I knew that it had a lot of potential to be high impact,” says the Atlanta-based partner . “But I never expected this recognition from the White House.” Established in the 19th century to provide educational opportunities for African American students who were denied access to other institutions, HBCUs have remained critical platforms for the education and advancement of students of color ever since. McKinsey served HBCUs in the wake of COVID-19 to support their operations, which led to  a major opportunity: working with the President’s Board of Advisors (PBA) on HBCUs on a pro bono basis. Below, Ryan shares a debrief from her trip to the White House, what led to meeting the President, and the award. What is your area of focus at McKinsey? I’m a partner in our public, social and healthcare practices . My client work focuses on supporting universities and other educational organizations to improve student outcomes, which means partnering with these institutions to help them increase graduation and retention rates, grow student enrollment, and become financially sustainable. McKinsey's work on the PBA’s first report to the President has been immeasurable and will be central to what we believe are excellent recommendations. What is the special role of HBCUs? HBCUs are mission-driven institutions with a proud history and a rich legacy of achievement. They confer 17 percent of all bachelor’s degrees awarded to Black students in the United States, driving economic mobility for its graduates who often move into higher-income quintiles post-graduation. HBCUs are also key to developing talent and have educated prominent and esteemed scholars, business leaders, entertainers, and public servants, graduating 40 percent of all Black engineers; 40 percent of all Black US Congress members; 50 percent of all Black lawyers; and 80 percent of all Black judges. Tell us about the firm’s work with HBCUs. We began serving HBCUs in 2020 in the wake of COVID to bolster their financial stability and critical operations in the early days of the pandemic. This led to a partnership between the United Negro College Fund, Thurgood Marshall College Fund, the Partnership for Education Advancement, and McKinsey. Together, we launched a project to systematically improve and share best practices across the HBCU network of over 100 institutions. How did the invitation to the White House come about? We worked with Delaware State University (DSU) on their strategic growth aspirations, including supporting them as they became the first HBCU to acquire another institution. DSU President Dr. Tony Allen was later appointed the chair of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs. Dr. Allen brought us into a partnership with the PBA to help accelerate their efforts to advance educational equity and economic opportunity for the nation’s HBCU students. Our firm committed to support the PBA pro-bono—an example of McKinsey’s unwavering dedication towards racial equity . Through the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility , we developed a fact base and view on trends in the higher education sector. This helped the PBA develop a key recommendation to the President on how to best accelerate HBCUs on a trajectory of resiliency and long-term sustainable growth. As a result of this pro bono work, we were awarded the Vista Prize for Public Leadership, with Dr. Allen noting: “McKinsey's work on the PBA's first report to the President has been immeasurable and will be central to what we believe are excellent recommendations.  To have your expertise by our side was a tremendous lift to our efforts.” Dr. Allen asked that I join the PBA for the discussion at the White House —a true testament to the credibility we’ve built in this space and our investment in meaningful client relationships. How was the experience of meeting the President and Vice-President? In the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, our group met with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, and the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Tanden commended our research on the linkage between education and Black economic mobility. The dialogue with the President and Vice President was equally substantive and included recognition for the research and work underpinning the PBA’s recommendations. At the meeting’s mid-point, the press were allowed in and cameras began rolling . During his remarks, Dr. Allen mentioned the Board’s partnership with our firm, the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility and the quality of our work. I know that he really values our partnership, but I did not expect him to say that in that moment, sitting next to the President, on such a public stage. After the meeting, I had the opportunity to individually meet with both the President and Vice President—dialogue and exchanges that I will never forget. Later that evening, I received the Vista Prize with colleagues Charag Krishnan, Christopher Copeland, Ian Jefferson, Fiyin Oladiran, Ian Jefferson and Nora Gardner at a formal award ceremony. It was a true “McKinsey-only” moment, an unforgettable experience that inspired me and the team to keep working for transformative outcomes. related Creating an ‘ecosystem’ to close the Black talent gap in technology ‘Spotlight’ on board diversity: McKinsey and Goldman Sachs move the needle Never miss a story","McKinsey's support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) has resulted in recognition from the White House, including an award and a meeting with President Biden.

Since its 2018 inception, Leap has built over 600 new businesses, including 20 “unicorns” or companies valued at more than $1 billion, and two decacorns valued at more than $10 billion. In 2022 alone, Leap helped clients build more than 190 new businesses, creating more than 20,000 jobs and $140 billion in value. And they’re just getting started. CEOs understand that now is the time to leverage new technologies as a source of competitive advantage. Generative AI alone, for example, is projected to power at least 75 percent of new businesses built this year. McKinsey is uniquely suited to help leaders seize the advantage these technologies offer. We are partnering with clients now to help them start generating compounding growth through the launch of new businesses. To learn more about Leap, and why every day is Leap day at McKinsey, we spoke with the practice’s global co-leaders, senior partners Ari Libarikian and Paul Jenkins . Talk to us about this moment. Why should CEOs care about building new businesses? Ari: Companies that are successful over multiple decades are always creating new sources of revenue: new products, new services, new businesses. In fact, our research shows it's a requirement for long-term success (over multiple decades). So, the question is not whether a company should build new businesses; it’s which ones to build and how? Right now, we’re in a period of uncertainty. That’s not new. What is new is the way CEOs are behaving. This time around, as compared to the global financial crisis or the dot com cycle, they're not only focused on near term resilience and cash, they’re also in parallel looking around the corner and investing in medium- and long-term growth opportunities like business building. What role is technology playing in all this? Paul: Technology is making it easier to build than ever before. There are two characteristics enabling this: connectivity and speed. If you’re a bank, for example, that wants to also become an insurer, connecting new insurance capabilities to your existing business is far more feasible than it has ever been. Or say you’re a utility company and you want to offer home retrofit services (including installation and financing), you can easily and digitally integrate with partners do provide customers with a true “one-stop-shop.” Cloud components, generative AI, and other advances are effectively collapsing time. Committed and innovative leaders can stand up a new idea so much quicker than even two or three years ago. The barrier to entry is just so much lower—and the effort required to build—is much lower than it used to be. Leap by McKinsey How is McKinsey helping clients build new businesses? Ari: In Leap, all we do is work with clients to help them imagine, launch, and scale new businesses. And when we help clients, we help them soup to nuts. We start with the initial ideas— What's the strategy? How will you drive growth? What are the business building ideas?—and we help prioritize those ideas and select what we’ll pursue. We then help clients take the next step:  blueprinting, building detailed business plans, creating the product MVP. Then it’s into the build. We help hire the team, build the technology, roll-out the product, drive customer engagement, gather feedback, improve it, and raise funding. And then we scale, running sales and marketing war rooms that help drive topline growth and value creation. Paul: That’s exactly right. We’re involved at every step in a very hands-on way. That includes the last phase, which is:  ""You now have built and launched a business. How do you now rapidly scale this so that it can reach its full potential?” We have a heavy focus on being along for the ride with our client helping them hire their long-term team and people, helping upskill and coach people. By the time we leave the building the client has something new and enduring: not just an at-scale business but a team and a set of capabilities to take it forward. Can you give an example? Ari: We worked with a power tools company to help them transition from a physical product to a digital product through a software-as-a-service business. The new business was a very different business. It had a different financial profile, different margins, and so on. It also required figuring out the types of skills needed across product development, design, digital, and sales. We deployed a team up front that played these various roles on day one, and then that team also helped hire the people who would work for the client in those roles permanently. By the time we were done, the client had a business that was well on its way toward its business goal—and it also had a team, a general manager, sales people, and tech people that could take it forward and ensure it endures. We describe ourselves at impact partners to our clients. What does that mean in this context? Paul: Nobody ever created a unicorn in two or three months. In order to really drive success, you need to be together, working as partners, for at least a year or 18 months. So there’s a time element to it and a level of relationship building and personal investment required to create success. In addition, the nature of the relationship is a partnership; you really are sitting at the same table, as almost joint-venture partners. We've identified a big opportunity together. We're going to capture it together. We're going to do it over a meaningful length of time. We will share in the benefits of our new venture. And we're going to be really challenging each other to get the best out of this all the way along that journey. Ari: When we help clients build businesses, we do this very much as partners. We are successful if our client is successful. And so we structure our partnership in a way where we are tracking impact month to month over the course of, as Paul points out, the typically couple of years of this relationship. Everything we do is pointed in the direction of helping our client build the business and build the capability for the long term. So that's what we measure ourselves against, that's what we want to get measured on to be successful partners to our clients in business building. What would you tell a CEO who’s thinking about building a new business but doesn’t know where to start? Paul: The best new businesses compete with unfair advantages in high growth areas of the economy. So put simply I would advise the CEO to begin thinking about a new business by looking at the assets and distinctive capabilities they have to see if they can deploy them to capture the business building opportunity associated with a mega trend. I’d also advise them to prepare to spend real time on this endeavor. You don't find chairs or founders of new ventures who don't spend significant time on that new venture. They also need to think about talent and diversity in the business building team. When we look across all the businesses that we've built, the single biggest driver of success is assembling the right team. Finally, I'd advise them to recognize that you need to set this up organizationally with the right conditions for speed. You need to make sure that you're able to exploit all of the advantages that come from corporate—and at the same time moving at the speed of a startup. You’re both passionate about this. In a few words, what inspires you about the work? Ari: In Leap, we've helped create 60,000 new jobs in the last few years globally. These are new jobs that didn't exist in new businesses that didn't exist. So what excites me is being able to help our clients build and create something out of nothing almost—and have that be a basis for success for them over the long term. Paul: The jobs created by those new businesses are doing some good for the world. That excites me. And these engagements are just fun—the pace, the energy. There's always a new challenge, a new opportunity to go after. Walking into a building where we're creating a new venture, it just feels alive. I just get a real kick out of being in that environment. related McKinsey named a Leader in Digital Transformation Services by Forrester Never miss a story","Leap by McKinsey, established in 2018, has built over 600 businesses, including 20 unicorns and two decacorns.

McKinsey launches an open-source ecosystem for digital and AI projects,"In addition to the open-source ecosystem, two enhancements to the Horizon suite of tools for AI development and implementation have also launched.",2023-09-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20launches%20an%20open-source%20ecosystem/open-source-hero-13-1536x864.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-launches-an-open-source-ecosystem,"McKinsey launches an open-source ecosystem for digital and AI projects McKinsey colleagues Stephanie Kaiser, senior designer; Rashida Kanchwala, senior software engineer; and Ankita Katiyar, software engineer. September 26, 2023 Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of a McKinsey open-source ecosystem that will host products from across the firm, including some of our leading-edge technologies and IP in AI including generative AI, digital, and cloud. The first major release in our collection is Vizro, a new component from our QuantumBlack Horizon suite, which helps users visualize data from their AI models. In addition to Vizro, the new ecosystem will host CausalNex , a tool for building cause-and-effect models that has been available to the public since 2020 through QuantumBlack Labs’ GitHub organization. “Open source has become a foundational element of how we deliver organizational transformation for our clients globally, because it enables technologists to adapt our methodologies and toolkits to meet their distinct needs,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky , a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey . “It is also our way to contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth and narrow the digital divide.” The open-source ecosystem can be accessed at GitHub . This milestone builds on our open-source momentum. In 2022 we released Kedro , a Python toolbox that streamlines the creation of machine-learning pipelines, to the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data incubator so it could evolve as an open standard. Early this year, we acquired Iguazio , whose open-source projects Nuclio and MLRun are integral to their strategy. “We are on a journey to be known for our technology capabilities as much as our strategic advice,” says Rodney Zemmel , a senior partner and global leader of McKinsey Digital. “This new ecosystem illustrates the firm’s belief and investment in open-source standards and gives all of our 6000+ technologists the opportunity to contribute their expertise and help clients gain the most value from their technology investments.” …this new ecosystem illustrates the firm’s belief and investment in open source standards and gives all of our 6000+ technologists the opportunity to contribute their expertise… Many businesses are struggling to scale their AI projects. In a recent survey , only 3 percent of companies have embedded AI in at least five business functions. Organizations are finding it takes as long to develop the 15th model as it did the first. Generative AI use cases, which have grown exponentially, are especially challenging due to the complexity of managing very large datasets and models. Our Horizon suite, announced in June, helps clients overcome these challenges and reduces the time it takes to realize value from their AI portfolios. It establishes a factory-like approach to delivering accurate data across all sources; building and monitoring scalable, integrated models; and ensuring transparency for quick, reliable decision making. Vizro, a tool that visualizes AI model data Vizro , the newest Horizon component, creates high-quality visualizations that allows users to better explore and analyze data from their models. In a matter of hours rather than weeks, teams can collaborate to define insights and present them to clients in live workshops or demos. Before Vizro, building dashboards required much longer timeframes, and often meant securing additional, scarce, front-end engineering or design talent. “What once required thousands of lines of code and extra staff to build, now can be accomplished in a day,” explains Joe Perkins , the product manager who led the ten-person team developing the tool. Vizro components are plug-and-play to maximize flexibility and scaling. A high level of visual design, code and data quality, and best practices are built into the tool, which also integrates industry and functional knowledge and leverages the power of open-source tools such as Plotly and Dash. “This accelerates the creation process and provides consistency and a high quality of output,” Joe says. “It all goes to increasing the client's understanding and trust in the data and insights.” Generative AI: Capturing the opportunity Horizon command center helps you understand ROI on data & AI initiatives In addition to Vizro, the Horizon suite has been enhanced with a new “command center” functionality for AI initiatives. It helps technology leaders see the status, adoption, and impact of their overall AI projects down to the individual use case, as measured by relevant business KPIs. The tool will help leaders analyze the health and productivity of an organization’s AI implementation, to flag roadblocks and opportunities for scaling. “Often organizations don’t know exactly how many use cases they are running because they are dispersed across the divisions, let alone how productive they are,” explains Matt Fitzpatrick , a senior partner and leader of QuantumBlack Labs. “With our command center, leaders can scan the landscape of their AI implementations and understand their value in terms that are meaningful to them, such as adoption status and ROI.” “The pace of AI development, in particular, has been stunning, and capturing and applying these new capabilities is extremely complex,” says Alex Singla , a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. “It can only be done through the intense collaboration and accelerated learning that comes from working within the open-source community.” Going forward, Horizon will become our firm’s platform for incubating, supporting, promoting and ultimately open sourcing more tools. Of the eleven Horizon components today, four are already available: Kedro and Vizro from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and MLRun and Nuclio from Iguazio.

McKinsey leaders herald new horizon of customer experience at Dreamforce 2023,"At Dreamforce 2023, McKinsey leaders from marketing, technology, and more offered a glimpse into the future of tech-powered growth.&nbsp;",2023-10-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/this%20is%20about%20making%20human%20lives%20better/dreamforce-hero-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-leaders-herald-new-horizon-of-customer-experience-at-dreamforce-2023,"McKinsey leaders herald new horizon of customer experience at Dreamforce 2023 McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels joined Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff for a fireside chat onstage at Dreamforce 2023. October 3, 2023 Dreamforce, the annual conference organized by Salesforce, is one of the biggest tech events of the year. With thousands of presentations, workshops and training sessions taking place in San Francisco over three days, the gathering sees leading thinkers and experts from across the Salesforce ecosystem offer their insights into the future of the tech industry. In this era of tech-powered growth, business leaders are expected to harness the power of tech and analytics – all enabled by generative AI to realize the full impact. McKinsey colleagues led and participated in a range of sessions at the event that explored important topics, from creating hyper-personalized experiences for customers to leveraging technology to drive sales productivity and accelerating the adoption of generative AI to improve ways of working. Our global managing partner Bob Sternfels sat down with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on day one to discuss the opportunities and challenges organizations face in this moment – including talent sourcing, the importance of personal renewal, and the future of AI. We caught up with a few members of our delegation on their key takeaways from this year’s event. Lareina Yee, Senior Partner I spend a lot of time unpacking the future of tech-powered growth with my colleague Steve Reis . We also talk about generative AI and its benefits to business, but what is it in service of? At the heart of this technology, it is about making human lives better. That is the whole promise of generative AI. On stage, I spoke with leaders of two very different businesses : Sarah Friar, CEO of Nextdoor, and Jean-André Rougeot, President and CEO of Sephora Americas. It was clear from them that if you’re thinking about this technology as an add-on, that’s not where you’re going to get value. The value is when you embed it into your strategy and leverage it to streamline operations, drive personalization, and more. I also spent the day with 40 CEOs delving further into generative AI. They were interested in how companies are executing against the promise of AI and valued the ability to exchange learnings together in the small group. These experiences reinforced for me that the companies who get generative AI right will have the potential to outgrow their peers by double digits. Jacky Wright, Senior Partner and Chief Technology Officer Generative AI is emerging as a virtual knowledge worker. For example, it can synthesize insights out of customer data or write sales scripts based on next-product-to-buy probabilities. The time saved can be invested in higher-quality activities and customer interactions. For most generative AI insights, a human must still interpret and oversee them, because the technology can fail at surprisingly simple tasks and invent convincing-sounding, but completely incorrect, responses. As Microsoft’s Peter Lee has said, “it is at once both smarter and dumber than any person you’ve ever met.” This technology has the potential to change the anatomy of work and improve productivity, but it’s vital that a human is involved. Jan-Christoph Köstring, Senior Partner Driving above-market growth is on the minds of business leaders across all sectors and industries, yet achieving this has proven difficult for many (only one in four companies have succeeded). However, there is a group of companies that have realized ambitious growth targets year over year. We call them the Growth Champions. They have cracked the code, so we explored their secret sauce and identified the key traits that are shared by these companies. One clear pattern across all of them is that they fully embraced the opportunity of tech-enabled growth. They make their marketing and sales tech stack (in 80 percent of cases this is Salesforce), the backbone of their growth activities. Building on this technology backbone, they innovate their marketing and sales approach: it starts with hyper-personalization, moving from outdated segmentation thinking to 1:1 relationships at scale. Consumers expect this and will go to another brand if they don’t get it. My colleagues Steve Reis and I recently shared insights on solutions that can deliver the hyper-personalization consumers are hungry for. In order to make this happen, Growth Champions activate their analytics and move them from nice-to-have to center stage, integrating them into the daily doing of their sales organization and supporting the automatization of sales activities. Obviously, accelerating growth through technology and analytics also requires different capabilities. Growth Champions have started to unite their business and IT teams to jointly develop the tech-enabled growth strategy. Tracy Francis, Senior Partner and Chief Marketing Officer The retail sector has experienced as much disruption in the past five years as the previous 25. The environment is still challenging, as we experience global inflation at its highest since the 1970s, consumer sentiment at record lows, and ongoing supply chain issues and labor imbalances. New trends have emerged. Consumers now use a spectrum of different channels to make purchases, have less brand loyalty, and higher expectations. The whole retail ecosystem is changing, including the relationship between retailers and suppliers. The workforce is also changing, with many planning to leave. This requires retailers to offer more flexibility, and to rethink their retention and promotion models. What are the most pressing priorities for consumer leaders today? Businesses need to become omnipotent on omnichannel: consumers will choose retailers based on ease and richness of end-to-end experience. Consumers also expect personalized experiences and offers, as well as accelerated delivery times. Finally, on ESG, consumers are now voting with their wallets for sustainability and broader purpose. Greg Kelly, Senior Partner Only seven percent of companies are delivering on the growth triple play by unifying creativity, analytics, and purpose. My colleagues Peter Dahlstrom, Brian Gregg, and I had the opportunity to facilitate a session with a group of chief revenue officers while at Dreamforce that explored what that 7 percent is doing right. The chief revenue officer role goes beyond traditional sales and marketing. They play a critical role driving growth of their businesses across the entire market landscape, working to delight their customers with a full range of products and solutions. These leaders were excited about the potential for built-for-growth technology, enabled by generative AI, to transform how they manage their sales and revenue streams. Salesforce’s own CRO Miguel Milano shared a behind-the-scenes look at how Salesforce uses its full range of solutions to drive and manage their revenue, and their own sales force. The CROs came away with a tangible understanding of how they can use technology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in their sales teams and simultaneously manage their revenue line with greater confidence.

Helping Black beauty founders claim more shelf space,"Fifty years after the launch of the first Black beauty brand, there&rsquo;s more work to be done to make the industry equitable. McKinsey is helping to make an impact.",2023-06-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinseys%20work%20to%20help%20black%20beauty%20founders%20claim%20more%20shelf%20space/newatmckinsey_atlanta_1536x864.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinseys-work-to-help-black-beauty-founders-claim-more-shelf-space,"Helping Black beauty founders claim more shelf space Black beauty founders convene at the McKinsey Atlanta office June 21, 2023 In 1973, Eunice Johnson founded Fashion Fair, a cosmetics company that became the first beauty brand designed exclusively for Black women. Women with darker skin tones would now no longer have to blend foundations themselves. This prestigious international brand allowed Black women to finally have the glamourous, more equitable department store shopping experience they deserved. “The elegant ladies behind the counters at department stores, all Black and dressed to the nines... Young ladies going with their mothers to buy makeup for their first prom or dinner dance... That’s the legacy of Fashion Fair, and it’s part of our history,” says Desiree Rogers, now co-owner of Fashion Fair. To keep this legacy alive, Desiree rebooted the iconic brand in 2019 , due in part to the much larger market availability today for beauty products aimed at people with more melanated skin tones. Despite the progress in the beauty industry since Fashion Fair’s groundbreaking launch, there is still a long way to go to achieve equity . Today, Black cosmetics brands make up only 2.5 percent of revenue in the beauty industry, even though Black consumers are responsible for over 11 percent of total beauty spending, and Black consumers have reported high rates of dissatisfaction with many of the current beauty products available to them. Black beauty brands account for a maximum of seven percent of brands carried by most stores, but Black people are still underrepresented within the industry and founders raise capital at lower rates than non-Black brands. To help move toward a more equitable market, McKinsey has conducted research and identified solutions, convened Black beauty founders , supported the 15 Percent Pledge to increase representation in stores , and helped develop founders through our Next 1B program , part of our 10 actions toward racial equity . Desiree and McKinsey senior partner Tiffany Burns explain more about McKinsey’s efforts, the industry, and how Black beauty founders are making their mark. Why is McKinsey focusing on beauty founders in particular? Tiffany: Black beauty consumers are growing in their spending, but at the same time, their needs aren’t being fully met. It’s a lost economic opportunity for real growth. Even as Black beauty brands offer amazing new products, a constellation of issues, including underinvestment in new brands and not enough representation on retail shelves, holds them back. It’s a problem that presents a lot of opportunity, but requires convening multiple partners to solve—a natural role for us to get involved. What is McKinsey’s approach to promoting Black beauty founders? Tiffany: We’re working on four fronts: research, convenings, supporting emerging founders, and working with retailers on expanding representation. Our research helps make the economic case and the convenings create a community of founders to offer mutual support and solutions. Our Next 1B program is a 12-week institute that offers skill building for entrepreneurs, and our work with the 15 Percent Pledge was focused on its strategy to scale in a sustainable way, to make sure it has pledges from the right blend of retailers so Black brands will show up in a variety of stores—department stores, drug stores, cosmetic stores, and more. What has been the impact of McKinsey’s work? Desiree: I’ve been involved with McKinsey’s convenings and really felt the community support. It makes such a difference to know there’s other founders to bounce ideas off who face similar challenges. And out in the industry, I always make sure the retailers we deal with—Walmart, CVS, Ulta, Target, Sephora and more—have McKinsey’s research and refer them to McKinsey with any questions. Retailers have told me how McKinsey’s work has changed how minority audiences will be presented in stores moving forward—they’re not to be ignored. That is huge. Retailers have told me how McKinsey’s work has changed how minority audiences will be presented in stores moving forward—they’re not to be ignored. That is huge. It’s phenomenal to see the change, and to see the excitement on the part of the retailer. What motivates you to tackle this issue? Tiffany: I worked in retail before coming to the firm, so I’ve dug into this issue. As a Black beauty consumer myself, I’ve seen the full spectrum of challenges and opportunities. Making progress here benefits so many people. Desiree: When you invest in companies that are minority owned, it’s likely that money will support their communities in terms of who the company hires and its philanthropic giving. I believe together we can hold hands and create some real scale among companies that are owned by minorities in this country—and we’ve got to have that. related “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce New tech accelerator propels underrepresented founders to success Never miss a story","McKinsey aims to support Black beauty founders through research, community convenings, and initiatives like the Next 1B program to address underrepresentation and funding disparities in the beauty industry.

New tech accelerator propels underrepresented founders to success,"Founders of tech startups who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ still face considerable hurdles.

She had a lot at stake as founder and CEO of Canela Media, a streaming platform for Hispanic and Latino audiences. While she had started other companies, she knew this one would be a much bigger undertaking—and risk—one she took on with her husband, Michael Rafferty, COO of Canela. “I told Michael, ‘Are you up for this? If we fail, we’ll be sleeping at our parents’ places with our four kids,’” she says with a laugh. Founded in 2019, Canela was one of few minority- and women-owned companies to secure venture-capital funding to help it grow. Following its series-A financing, Canela experienced whirlwind growth that’s been difficult to keep up with. That’s what attracted Isabel to McKinsey’s InNYC accelerator , a pro bono program that provides a suite of firm resources to New York City tech start-up founders from underrepresented groups. The program takes an expansive view of the underrepresented community to include, socio-economic status, first generation college students, LGBTQ+ people, and women. It is focused on bringing together start-ups with inspiring concepts that have faced systemic barriers and opportunity gaps in the past. Initially, Isabel was hesitant to place her baby in unfamiliar hands. “I thought, ‘Let’s see,’” she says, “but McKinsey earned our trust quickly. I felt at peace for the first time in a while because I had more clarity about our future.” Economies are stronger when growth opportunities are created for everyone, yet women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ business founders continue to face barriers, such as lack of funding and access to professional networks. These founders push forward, often without support, shouldering considerable emotional, operational, and financial burdens. InNYC, a program out of McKinsey’s New York office, aims to accelerate inclusive innovation in technology. To bring the tech start-up playing field closer to level, the New York office hosted its inaugural InNYC “cohort pitch day,” where nine finalists presented tech platforms poised to make a difference in their communities. From there, three start-ups—all founded by women of color—went on to receive 12 weeks of dedicated firm resources: Canela , the Hispanic and Latino streaming platform, Goalsetter , a family-oriented savings, investing, and financial education app, and Landit , a career-development platform aimed at increasing diversity. Parvathy Menon , an engagement manager who led McKinsey’s work with the start-ups, says that despite the innovative products and successes, the founders have had trouble securing corporate sponsorships, making deals, building networks, and more. “It truly showed how much factors like race and gender skew the playing field in a way that is hard to comprehend on a daily basis,” she says. “So not only did we work on a wide variety of business challenges, but we were there with them through real emotional highs and lows.” Focusing on long-term growth Canela launched not long before the pandemic—a turbulent time for a streaming platform, when viewership spiked, but advertisers were hesitant to spend. Despite these challenges, in the blink of an eye, Isabel and Michael went from being hands on in the work to growing their departments and figuring out HR onboarding; from just nine employees to 110. “With fast growing companies, you don’t have time to sit back and analyze the business, and you start to get separated from the baseline work,” says Michael. Working with McKinsey, they codified an onboarding process to ease growing pains in the short term, refined the equity story for the medium term, and performed an IPO readiness assessment and five-year charting for the long term. “They organized our brains,” says Isabel. Lisa Skeete Tatum, Founder and CEO of Landit, a personalized coaching and career pathing platform to increase the success of women and diverse groups, came into the program with massive opportunity in front of her—and wanted McKinsey to help her seize it. Having secured contracts with Fortune 50 companies, global HR companies and smaller organizations, she needed playbooks for scaling. “As a start-up we were trying to figure out how to successfully navigate and meet the major demand we were experiencing,” Lisa says. “How do we do that and not drown in the process?” She found that in her short three months in the program, everything changed. She gained quick access to experts who created expansion levers such as pricing; identified customers’ future needs for the changing workplace through case studies; strengthened the impact of her communication with customers through increased clarity of her business impact; and accelerated her team’s work by bringing them all in for strategy sessions. “Connecting the dots of the opportunity we’d built for ourselves with McKinsey’s global experience—that was invaluable. It was company making,” says Lisa. As a Black woman founder, the deck is stacked against you. McKinsey brought a few more cards my way in a short period of time. It was liberating. Learning from the founders Tanya Van Court, CEO and Founder of Goalsetter, the financial literacy app for children, says that her experience in the accelerator led her to break through longstanding challenges quickly and make major decisions, such as pursuing growth through bank and school partnerships rather than as an employee benefit. Brian Clement , a McKinsey associate, worked with Tanya throughout her 12-week engagement and says it was unlike any other experience at the firm, largely due to Tanya’s dedication and one-woman scrappiness. The juxtaposition of sky-high possibilities and existential crises made for a roller-coaster experience, pushing Brian to find solutions he’d never had to before. He credits Tanya with the success. “I was extremely impressed,” says Brian. “I’d never seen one person balance so much while setting such a positive tone for her staff.” Working with her also exposed Brian, a White man, to the experiences and difficulties being a Black woman founder faced. “There were many emotional ups and downs, and Tanya was so generous in talking about her experience with race and gender as a founder,” he says. “I learned a lot.” Spreading that awareness and building on it might have been most important to Tanya. “As a Black woman founder, the deck is stacked against you. McKinsey brought a few more cards my way in a short period of time,” says Tanya. “It was liberating.” The success of the inaugural cohort has Parvathy and others hard at work on refining the program— 2023 program applications are open now . “There’s been so many great learnings,” says Parvathy. “We're going to be even more impactful now.” related At Slush event, McKinsey shows how startups can become unicorns Fifteen unicorns founded by McKinsey alums may be shaping your world Never miss a story","McKinsey's InNYC accelerator supports underrepresented tech founders, providing resources to overcome systemic barriers.

The economic implications, especially for developing countries, are significant. Research shows that increased connectivity can boost a wide range of industries, from retail and healthcare to manufacturing and oil and gas and add trillions of dollars to global GDP. In agriculture, for example, new use cases such as crop and livestock monitoring, farming by drone, drilling and production optimization and automation, and autonomous farming machinery all promise to radically reshape food production and accelerate sustainability. To help prepare for this next era of digital connectivity, more than 3,000 telecom leaders, analysts, and other industry players descended upon Copenhagen in September for the largest ever DTW (Digital Transformation World) global conference , an annual gathering sponsored by industry alliance TM Forum . The event, the first DTW conference to take place in person since the COVID-19 pandemic, came at a critical juncture for operators worldwide. As traditional value pools continue to erode, telcos are seeking to unlock new growth opportunities through data-driven transformation, an overhaul of traditional operating models, and novel approaches to ecosystem-building. McKinsey, a 2022 DTW knowledge partner, had a substantial presence throughout the three-day event. Our telco experts organized and participated in multiple sessions tackling some of the most urgent issues facing the industry, with McKinsey clients from the US, Europe, and Latin America discussing their challenges lessons, and achievements. “It was exciting the to see the momentum in the telco industry on full display, as leaders discussed the opportunities and challenges of becoming truly future-fit,” said McKinsey partner Duarte Begonha , who leads our core technology work in the telecom sector. “Telco leaders know that they need to think differently about collaboration, customer experience, talent, operating models, and what it takes to meet the needs of the modern enterprise.” Nik Willetts , President and CEO of TM Forum, said DTW 2022 would leave participants with “energy and inspiration” for urgent change and the importance of designing “the right operating model.” “We’re done talking about silver bullets from 5G,” Willetts told Duarte. He added: “It's about building a data-driven or AI-driven business, and the right operating model to achieve it.” In a session called “Thinking like a techco, not a telco: How to win in B2B,” Duarte outlined untapped B2B opportunities for connectivity providers—services like cloud and AI ops and next-generation connectivity products like SD-WAN and edge computing. The discussion included the impact of delayering, the need to change the CIO role to a COO role, shifting from a focus on just products to broad solutions, and establishing journeys specific to B2B customer needs. It was exciting the to see the momentum in the telco industry on full display, as leaders discussed the opportunities and challenges of becoming truly future-fit. In a McKinsey-driven session on data, partner Benjamim Vieira was joined by associate partners Sebastián Cubela and Victor Trigo , to discuss how to build a data-driven telco. A key strategy is digital twins : virtual representations of real-world products or systems, to collect and model data. “Digital twins bring together the mirrored [data] and intelligent [AI] worlds,” Sebastián said, adding that roughly three-quarters of large enterprises, across industries, are actively investing in them. In the final McKinsey session, on Cloud migration, partner Frederik Van Hecke discussed how telcos play a “marginal” role in the cloud market—for now. They can modernize their own IT systems to achieve scalability and cost efficiency; and as cloud suppliers, they can enrich ICT (information and communication technology) offerings for enterprise customers. “While there are multiple options, partnering with a cloud provider is the best viable option to quickly develop a capable cloud offering,” Frederik advised. related The Mobile World Congress insights shaping our conversations with tech and telco leaders Never miss a story","McKinsey participated in the DTW 2022 conference, addressing the future of digital connectivity and its economic impact, especially in developing countries.

This year also marked the first time McKinsey was an official air show partner. Throughout the week, at a purpose-built chalet overlooking the event’s airstrip, colleagues from McKinsey’s Aerospace and Defense Practice hosted hundreds of client executives and industry leaders to explore topics like the future of air mobility, sustainable aviation, diversity and inclusion, and resilience. “Our presence at Farnborough this year is a perfect expression of the way our practice has grown and expanded,” says senior partner Varun Marya , who helps lead McKinsey’s aerospace and defense work globally. “Today, working in areas from general aviation to space, we help our clients set bold agendas, implement technologies, and develop capabilities to improve their businesses in substantial and sustainable ways.” This work is informed by our expertise and perspective in the sector, which was on full display at Farnborough. Partner Jesse Klempner moderated a panel on “The Role of Space in Driving Sustainability and Security,” where he was joined by representatives from the European Space Agency, Lockheed Martin, the World Economic Forum, and the satellite internet provider OneWeb. Elsewhere, partner Robin Riedel , who co-leads the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, spoke on the event’s mainstage about what it will take to coordinate sector efforts and reach net zero by 2050. Later, along with leaders from the Mission Possible Partnership and the World Economic Forum, Robin convened an executive session on sustainable aviation at our McKinsey chalet and interviewed six industry disruptors whose ideas and innovations are shaping the future of aerospace and defense. Partner Emma Loxton also spoke about the road to net-zero aviation during a CFO panel that focused on building sustainable business models. Held on the event’s mainstage, the panel included executives from Rolls Royce, Shell, Virgin Atlantic, and ZeroAvia, a renewable-hydrogen aircraft developer. In another event, Emma held a reception for women working in aerospace at the McKinsey chalet, bringing together dozens of women executives and their allies to discuss inclusive talent. Clean skies for tomorrow: Delivering on the global power-to-liquid ambition That topic was the subject of one of our most widely talked-about reports of the week, Debugging the software talent gap in aerospace and defense . Published on one of the event’s busiest days, the report generated several client conversations and earned coverage in the print edition of Aviation International News’s air show daily. In it, the authors describe the skills deficit facing the industry, particularly on the tech front. They illustrate the opportunity companies have to “think differently” about their talent pipelines, which can be seized through several tactics, including increasing recruitment among traditionally underrepresented populations. Women, for example, are a third more underrepresented in aerospace and defense than they are in other sectors, and women of color make up just 10 percent of entry-level employees. One path to improving those figures lies in creating and nurturing enthusiasm for the industry among diverse groups of young people. Late in the week, we hosted the final round of the Air League’s 2022 Global Innovators Challenge. The Air League is a UK charity focused on changing lives through aviation, and this year’s challenge asked participants to propose ideas for accelerating the sector’s transition to zero-carbon emissions. Six finalists presented their ideas in front of a judging panel that included representatives from leading industry organizations; McKinsey was represented on the panel by Emma. The winning team, “Flush to Fly,” presented its concept to source sustainable aviation fuels from sewage waste, had the opportunity to present their concept at the event’s mainstage at the close of the week. related Are flying cars finally ready to take off?

However, data-driven opportunities to move faster and make better-informed finance and people decisions are challenging to seize and execute. With this in mind, McKinsey and Workday have teamed up to bring McKinsey-proprietary knowledge and analytics, benchmarks, and recommendations onto the Workday Enterprise Management Cloud . This alliance provides real-time data-driven insights and recommendations for the C-suite to solve challenges in finance and human resources. The combination of McKinsey’s expert insights across industries and functions paired with Workday’s innovative technology and analytics enables clients to address business challenges and maximize returns from their technology and data investments. In one case, for example, the collaboration between Workday and McKinsey resulted in a real-time dashboard that identifies sources of attrition – at the individual level – to help retain critical talent. McKinsey is also building a team of in-house experts to develop solutions directly within the Workday platform. “Companies today are navigating an increasingly dynamic environment, which requires new and innovative ways to solve business problems,” said Chano Fernandez, co-CEO of Workday. “By working with McKinsey, we look forward to delivering the next generation of analytics and insights to the C-suite so that our joint clients can address key business needs in finance and HR and maximize their investment in Workday.” There is perhaps no better time than now for an alliance between McKinsey and Workday, which will help leaders build thriving and resilient organizations. McKinsey and Workday have already achieved substantial impact in their initial phase of work, including enhancing Workday Strategic Sourcing by building a dynamic negotiation analytics engine to evaluate procurement bids. Within the first sixteen months of implementation, McKinsey and Workday refined, piloted, and successfully deployed the technology with more than 30 clients, capturing them nearly $2 billion in savings as measured by McKinsey. “Leaders are looking for the technology and expertise that will help them make the best decisions possible in this challenging moment,” said Bob Sternfels, McKinsey global managing partner. “There is perhaps no better time than now for an alliance between McKinsey and Workday, which will help leaders build thriving and resilient organizations.” Never miss a story","McKinsey and Workday have partnered to enhance finance and HR decision-making by integrating McKinsey’s analytics and insights into Workday’s platform.

April 22, 2022 As Head of Environmental Sustainability at McKinsey, each day I feel a mix of cautious optimism and burning urgency. On the one hand, I am energized by the incredible green solutions that are being developed to make operations more sustainable. This includes recent wins and milestones across technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels and carbon removals. Our fellow Sustainable Aviation Buyer’s Alliance member United Airlines recently completed the world’s first passenger flight on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel, while the Frontier initiative, of which McKinsey is a founding member , created an advance market commitment to buy $925 million of carbon removals by 2030. These examples show us that progress is possible, meaningful, and happening every day around the world. On the other hand, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments offer a stark reminder that we must recommit ourselves to our mission daily if we hope to limit global warming to 1.5°C degrees. One year ago, our firm committed to reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030 and set science-based targets for 2025 validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative in line with a 1.5°C-degree pathway. Since then, we have made significant progress that we can be proud of, and we also have a long way to go. Today, on Earth Day, I want to take a moment to reflect on our journey. Reducing absolute emissions from office operations by 25 percent Embracing electric transportation, shifting to renewable electricity, and creating sustainable office spaces. Within just one year, offices with the highest share of automobile transportation have introduced electric vehicle or hybrid vehicle policies. We are actively working on rolling this out globally — and for countries with nascent electric-vehicle infrastructure, we are exploring alternative mobility packages that enable our colleagues to use different transport options like rail passes, shared mobility memberships, or occasion-based access to rental cars. In terms of our electricity consumption, we were the first global consultancy to join RE100 in 2018, and we set a target of 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025. We reached 95 percent in 2020, and we are anticipating to have reached 97 percent for 2021. For countries without an established renewable energy certificate system, we are actively working with other RE100 members to send a demand signal to drive progress and scale up renewable energy production globally. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds of our existing global office space has achieved green-building certification. Reducing travel emissions by 30 percent per colleague Implementing hybrid working models and supporting the advancement of sustainable aviation fuels. Travel accounted for 83 percent of our firm’s 2019 carbon footprint. With the switch to remote working, we have seen travel drop by 70 to 80 percent over the last two years. As we shift back into the new normal, we are implementing hybrid working models, aiming to walk the fine line between maintaining the social fabric of our firm and how we serve our clients, all the while also drastically reducing emissions. Some examples include virtual recruiting, remote client engagements, and traveling for critical meetings only. Aside from traveling less, sustainable aviation fuels are the most promising near-term solution that can help us on our 2030 net-zero journey. These fuels have the potential to deliver the performance of fossil jet fuel with over 70 percent fewer lifecycle emissions. However, there is currently no accounting system approved by Greenhouse Gas Protocol to track a company’s emission reductions from sustainable aviation fuel against their science-based targets. A functioning certificate and accounting system will be critical to scale demand. This is one of the reasons we are founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance , and why we are working closely with the World Economic Forum Clean Skies For Tomorrow initiative as knowledge partners and signatories to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow 2030 Ambition Statement to reach 10 percent sustainable aviation fuel adoption by 2030. Halting the rise of global emissions is one of the world’s biggest challenges, and its complexity is an inspiration for us to work harder... As the world works toward a green overhaul, it can be intimidating to take on challenges that seem intractable. Our ethos at McKinsey is one of problem solving, and there is no challenge too great to solve.

The work brings to life the concept of hybrid intelligence and will form the basis for QuantumBlack’s new visual identity. April 29, 2022 In 2015, McKinsey acquired QuantumBlack, a sophisticated analytics start-up of more than 30 data scientists, data engineers, and designers based in London. They had made their name in Formula 1 racing, applying data science to help teams gain every possible advantage in performance. Healthcare, transportation, energy, and other industry clients soon followed. Many times, acquisitions melt quietly into the parent company. This isn’t the case for QuantumBlack; it has been an accelerating force for our work in analytics. Today, it enters a new chapter by officially becoming the unified AI arm of McKinsey. “When we talk about helping our clients achieve sustainable and inclusive growth , AI is naturally part of the conversation. It’s transforming all businesses, including the way we, as McKinsey, serve organizations,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky , who along with Alex Singla leads QuantumBlack. Over the past seven years, the QuantumBlack community has helped McKinsey achieve a number of feats: building and then donating Kedro , an industry-leading developer tool, to the open-source community; being named a Leader in AI ; and supporting women in technology through community efforts and mentorship. The team grew quickly, to 400 in 2020, and now has more than 1000 technical practitioners across the globe today. Along the way, QuantumBlack has been a critical part of many digital and AI transformations across industries. “We have now brought together all of our analytics colleagues under one umbrella called QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey,” says Alex Singla, “sharing a single culture and strongly defined career pathways, and using common methods and tools.” Team members range from deeply experienced data scientists and engineers to AI-fluent business consultants. The firm has also undertaken intensive training and certification in all aspects of AI and machine learning, including digital and analytics risk. “One thing that hasn ’ t changed: our original principle of combining the brilliance of the human mind and domain expertise with innovative technology to solve the most difficult problems,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky. “We call it hybrid intelligence , and it starts from day one on every project.” AI initiatives are known to be challenging; only one in ten pilots moves into production with significant results. “Adoption and scaling aren’t things you add at the tail end of a project; they’re where you need to start,” points out Alex Singla. “We bring our technical leaders together with industry and subject-matter experts so they are part of one process, co-creating solutions and iterating models. They come to the table with the day-to-day insights of running the business that you’ll never just pick up from the data alone.” Our end-to-end and transformative approach is what sets McKinsey apart. Clients are taking notice: two years ago, most of our AI work was single use cases, and now roughly half is transformational. Another differentiating factor is the assets created by QuantumBlack Labs . “We capture the insights we have learned over the years with industries and fuse them with the best technologies to stay at the forefront,” explains Matt Fitzpatrick , a senior partner who leads QuantumBlack Labs with Jeremy Palmer. These tech assets can solve up to 70 percent of the work that used to be done on a bespoke basis. “We already know how to tie the analytic model into the client’s data pipelines. Now we have industry models that are plug-and-play with security, scalability, and risk management already baked in,” says Paul Beaumont , a senior principal data scientist based in Singapore. For example, the CustomerOne toolkit for telecommunications companies can reduce time to market for analytics campaigns by 75 percent. QuantumBlack Labs will expand significantly over the next year: “We want to become a magnet for the best technologists in the world and create assets that bring together all of our knowledge, so we can take this to our clients,” says Matt. Today, our experts work in major cities around the globe, but one tradition from QuantumBlack’s early days remains. “There has always been beautiful art on the walls, a deep commitment to high-quality design, and a fantastic community and culture,” recalls Kat Shenton , who has been with QuantumBlack since 2017. The team recently engaged Sougwen Chung , an AI artist and researcher, to create a painting that brings to life the concept of hybrid intelligence and will form the basis for QuantumBlack’s new visual identity. As a first step in the artistic process, QuantumBlack data scientists processed data from a river to train its CausalNex machine learning model. “It was the ideal tool for this project because it intrinsically requires humans and tech to work together,” explains Paul. Sougwen further developed the model, adding her own biofeedback. The model guides the movement of two robotic arms that paint alongside her to create a beautiful swirling visual. The result, as you can see in the film on this page, is a meld of artistry and technology that expresses the cutting-edge work we do for our clients. related QuantumBlack continues expansion with two new offices in Asia QuantumBlack opens in Montreal, a leading center of AI Never miss a story","McKinsey's QuantumBlack has officially become its unified AI arm, emphasizing hybrid intelligence that combines human expertise with innovative technology.

Our experts on the numbers—and what’s at stake. Climate change will unevenly affect regions, sectors, and communities, with developing countries and those with large fossil-fuel resources among the most in need of a well-managed transition to net-zero. February 8, 2022 “It’s heartening that the conversation we are having now  is not ‘do we transition,’” says Mekala Krishnan, “but ‘how do we do it — and do it well?’” Mekala is a McKinsey partner who led the work on our new report, The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring , that focuses on the economic and societal changes needed to limit the planet to  1.5°C degrees of average warming. It analyzes the implications for demand, capital spending, costs, and the impact on jobs in the sectors that produce 85 percent of overall emissions. It also looks at what this will mean for 69 countries, in some cases down to the county level. “Often when we discuss the net-zero transition, we focus on the end-state,” says Mekala . “But this report offers an unconventional lens: we take a close look at the sheer magnitude of the changes along the way of this massive undertaking to help leaders prepare for and understand what to expect.” We spoke with Mekala and two members of the research team: Danielle Imperato , an engagement manager, and Ryan Barrett , a climate risk specialist, to learn more. First, how did you come to work on sustainability at McKinsey? Danielle: I’ve been focusing on energy transition and decarbonization here for about three years. Working on reports like this one and the net-zero Europe report has been an energizing and invaluable complement to client work. Ryan: I’ve long had a personal interest in sustainability topics. Early in my career, I had the opportunity to highlight the connections between climate change, finance, and the economy at a financial institution, where I created scenarios for transitioning to a net-zero economy. It was good preparation for my work on this report years later. Mekala: I knew I wanted to work on the most important, complex, and systemic problems that affect the most people around the world—and to help create a better world for our next generation. I led the work on our physical climate risk report in January 2020, which laid out the imperative for the net-zero transition—which is the focus of this new report. What changes should leaders expect in a full-scale net-zero transition? Mekala: First, a net-zero transition will be universal, affecting every country and sector. It will be significant. We model a particular net-zero scenario from the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of central banks. In this scenario, $9.2 trillion will need to be spent per year over the next 30 years on physical assets, such as renewable power and infrastructure for electric vehicles. That’s a $3.5 trillion increase from what we’re spending today. The transition will also be front-loaded, in that we need to take action and deploy capital now for benefits down the road. If the transition is delayed or disorderly, it will come with a lot of risk... But if it is managed well, it brings opportunity for everyone. Perhaps most importantly, it will unevenly affect countries, sectors, and communities—this is the heart of the climate challenge. Developing countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Kenya, and those with large fossil fuel resources such as Qatar, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, will be among those where the most significant economic shifts could be needed; as well as sectors such as power, mobility, and heavy industry. Finally, if the transition is delayed or disorderly, it will come with a lot of risk, such as energy supply shortages, stranded infrastructure assets, price increases, and worker dislocation. But if it is managed well, it brings opportunity for everyone; this is what we all have to work towards. What about jobs? Ryan: We estimate that 185 million jobs would be lost by 2050 while 200 million direct and indirect jobs will be gained.  But it’s important to put these numbers in context; they are relatively smaller compared to what we would estimate for shifts driven by automation, the future of work, and other macroeconomic forces. As Mekala pointed out, this shift will be uneven—the losses and gains will be concentrated in specific sectors and geographies, which is a challenge that has to be managed well. Managing the transition well will take good leadership. How will the net-zero transition shape corporate agendas? Danielle: From a day-to-day standpoint, we will see sustainability become ingrained in every part of a company’s agenda. Whether it’s a defining strategy for new and existing products; managing supply chains; or assessing risk and making capital allocations, climate will become a deciding factor. Businesses will have to hire new types of talent to manage environmental requirements and develop new means for reporting progress to all of their stakeholders. Every colleague will be affected, from the leaders setting the agenda to the front-line workers creating and selling the products or services. How might our lives as consumers change? Ryan: At the moment, consumers suffer from a lack of choice—it’s hard to find sustainable goods at affordable prices. Over the next five years, I expect it’ll become easier to make the choice to lower emissions in your day-to-day life, whether it’s about which car you buy, how you heat and cool your house, which household items you use, or other consumer choices. Finally, what will it take to ensure this transition happens in an inclusive way? Mekala: As someone who comes from India, which will likely be disproportionately exposed to the physical and economic risks of climate change and the net-zero transition, I think it is extremely important to keep in mind. For this transition to be inclusive, leaders will need to create incentives that account for the inherent unevenness of the problem. This has to be a shared problem, otherwise there will be winners and losers. I hope this report contributes to a transition that is equitable to everyone globally. related Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero McKinsey acquires Vivid Economics and Planetrics to help clients navigate climate change Never miss a story","The transition to a net-zero economy will require $9.2 trillion annually over 30 years and will unevenly impact regions and sectors, particularly developing countries.

This August, he became the global leader of our Marketing & Sales Practice . A married father of four who lives in Atlanta and grew up in Virginia and Kentucky, Greg has spent his career focusing on helping clients grow and outperform in the consumer sector. We spoke with him to learn more about his background, how he thinks about growth now and in the future, and what McKinsey is doing to help clients get there in a sustainable and inclusive way. Tell us a little about your background and how it has shaped you. Education has always been a priority for my family. My grandfather was a student in a one-room schoolhouse in Appalachia. He saw firsthand the way that education could change lives, and he dedicated his life to that mission. He worked as a school superintendent in Virginia for 46 years. My father followed in his footsteps. He was a college professor, and he served as president of a women’s university. I see education the same way they did. Good education empowers and mobilizes people. It gives people choices and opportunities to pursue their desired professions and, most importantly, it enables growth—both on an individual and macro level. Investments in education and training programs that teach and reinforce people’s skills increase workforce participation, decrease unemployment, and upskill workers. Family is another passion of yours. What’s a lesson from them you bring to your client work? Understand aspirations before you rush to advice and solutions. I have a son more passionate about tech company rivalries than sports rivalries, a daughter with a computer science degree who’s pursuing priesthood, a highly-creative daughter exploring a career in marketing, and a transgender son focused on animal welfare and human rights who’d like to be a veterinarian. I have learned from them to search for what gives them real meaning and purpose and to help them prioritize their pursuits for getting there no matter how different they may be from my wife or me, or each other. We often refer to a poem in our home that advises parents to give children “roots and wings.” For me, roots are what your values are, where you come from, and wings enable you to go off and achieve your dreams. Similarly, with clients, my focus is on listening to them, understanding their context, helping them set their aspirations, and then getting specific on how they can achieve them. How does McKinsey think about helping clients grow? Being an impact partner for our clients today means helping them fuel their recoveries, which will restart our economies and in turn speed the world’s recovery. But this isn’t about growth at all costs; sustainable and inclusive growth requires understanding how the future of communities and the environment are deeply intertwined and understanding how driving social equity and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive. In today’s transparent world, consumers understand just how much of an impact companies have on the environment and society. And so, companies with a relatable purpose that is authentic to their heritage are the ones that resonate most for consumers. We’re thinking hard about how we can help our clients grow and make an impact that transcends the bottom line and improves communities and the environment. How can they help their people develop and reskill where necessary? How can they not just cut emissions but restore, renew, and replenish the environment? These questions are top-of-mind for the CEOs I serve now. What’s the most exciting trend in marketing and sales right now? Selling direct-to-consumer (DTC). Consumer decision journeys —what, how, where and when they buy, and how they interact with a brand post-purchase—have been completely upended throughout the pandemic. Seventy-five percent of consumers have tried new digital behaviors. E-commerce sales penetration in the United States more than doubled to about 35 percent in 2020 from around 16 percent the previous year, the equivalent of roughly ten years of growth in a few months. All this accelerated growth has driven our clients to move. Consumer-facing brands are looking to connect with consumers in a more personalized way at scale. Business-to-business (B2B) digital commerce is also undergoing a major transformation as buyers have flexed to remote and digital ways of engaging. Eight in ten B2B leaders say that omnichannel is just as or more effective than traditional methods. To connect directly with its customers, B2B leaders are completely changing their go-to-market approach by building new DTC models at record speeds. For example, one company we worked with stood up a new DTC model in a matter of months, which would typically have taken years. And more companies are innovating their sales approaches and allocating resources at speeds not experienced before using a hybrid sales model. The growth triple play: Creativity, analytics, and purpose Lastly, where and how do you see CEOs driving transformative growth in 2022? Uncertainty is the new certainty. While there is no playbook for this kind of disruption, there are courses of actions leaders should be considering and planning. From a marketing and sales perspective, with inflation rising, the most important immediate action is to strengthen value propositions and plan for 2022 price increases. Our assessments show that inflation will abate but not evenly across commodities and companies. Companies need to have 2022 aspirations that address the increase and go beyond relying on discounts and promotions by putting the customer front and center. Second, leaders need plans to accelerate ahead of the digital and e-commerce shift. Too many companies are still trailing, waiting for it to become more significant. Consumers increasingly expect the same type of digital engagement and fulfillment as they experience in their personal lives, and most suppliers are not delivering it. Finally, leaders are strengthening what we call full-funnel marketing —an approach that combines brand building and performance marketing. While virtually every company has opportunities to continue to improve their performance marketing, which relies on granular data and predictive analytics, our work shows that it has to be complemented with a focus on building awareness and brand love.

Meet two partners on a mission to help women of color lead at work,"Women of color have faced disproportionate challenges in the workplace, especially during the pandemic.

Of those, Black and Latina women have faced disproportionate challenges, with unemployment rates climbing to nearly 9 percent for both groups. Our research has shown that there is a correlation between profitability and companies that build inclusive cultures of diverse talent. To do so effectively, leaders must be role models of change who go beyond words and implement change. Two of our colleagues, partners Gayatri Shenai and Sara Prince , have served as moderators at the Minority Women Lead conference, which is dedicated to helping women of color advance in the workplace. They talked to us about how they’re helping support minority women colleagues as well as clients. How has the pandemic shaped your focus on women in the workplace—and particularly women of color? Sara: Honestly, my priorities haven’t changed.  The twin pandemic issue of the global health crisis and racial inequity only bring into sharp focus the very real issues women, women of color, and even more specifically Black women, face. Gayatri: For me, COVID has been an opportunity to celebrate women’s achievements—for example, those in STEM —and to thank them for all they do every day. I prioritize my day around people—which means having conversations with my clients, my teams, my colleagues, and people in my community. We talk about personal and professional development goals. I offer whatever advice I can. As a consultant so accustomed to solving problems, one tough lesson I’ve learned is that not all problems necessarily need a solution. Sometimes as a leader, your people need you to just be there to listen, even if it’s for 10 minutes. What’s most top-of-mind for your women minority clients and colleagues right now? Gayatri: As more companies talk about the return to the office, there’s growing concern that the inequities women of color have faced will be even more exacerbated. Even before the pandemic, women of color were promoted more slowly than other groups of employees and were less likely to say their manager advocated for new opportunities for them. In this moment, connectivity is what everyone’s talking about. Sara: Building off the return-to-office topic, leaders are having to make tough choices about the spectrum of flexibility they will allow while teammates and employees are making tough choices about what working dynamics they will accept.  In that, the focus on support for a diverse profile of leaders can get lost. There is a bit of tension as to whether all the work for racial justice and equity will fade to the backdrop in this moment. How is McKinsey helping organizations respond to these challenges? Gayatri: As a firm, we have been raising this issue, creating awareness and getting organizations to act through our research , publications and work with clients. We’ve also developed programs specifically focused on elevating executives of color to reach their professional aspirations. One such example is our Black Leadership Academy . Sara: What’s particularly impactful about our Black Leadership Academy, which is one of our 10 actions to advance racial justice and equity, is that it’s an opportunity to spend time with leaders of participating organizations and help them think about how they reshape their talent pipelines to be more inclusive.  In addition to this, our Institute for Black Economic Mobility is helping equip communities and organizations with the facts and insights they need to take action. What we lose when we lose women in the workforce We know women of color are more often under-mentored and under-sponsored than their White counterparts. How are you both working to change that at McKinsey? Gayatri: Anytime I have a new opportunity—like a speaking engagement, for instance—I offer it to a minority woman before anyone else. I’ve also formed a habit of checking in on them regularly to see how they are feeling, what’s going on for them, and how I can be helpful. In the last year, I’ve found myself starting emails with an acknowledgement of thanks—letting these women know I appreciate them and their work. This could be following a difficult analysis they drove, a client meeting they led, a conference they moderated. The feedback I have received is that it helps them feel seen and appreciated and makes a difference in morale. Sara: I’ve been doing 15-minute zoom hangouts with folks on my team. They are optional, but it clears time to be connected in a way that’s not necessarily about a specific workstream or deliverable. I have also been looking for those quiet voices and asking them for time to check in. Separately, I’ve been involved in putting together a series of events as part of our Black Leadership Academy that brings our current and former women participants together for discussions. It’s intended to help foster a community for these women to network, and we’re now extending it to our Asian, Hispanic, and Latino Leadership Academies as well. I just try to be a listening ear where they can put down whatever mask they are holding up for a few minutes. We all need that space of relief so we can keep doing the hard work of forging new paths. Do you have the opportunity to do similar things with your clients? How so? Gayatri: In the world of the pandemic, virtual happy hours with a glass of wine have been my go-to, but I also have clients who WhatsApp, text, FaceTime, and just call me. We share laughs and also frustrations over what feels toughest right now, and I’m just happy to be a listening ear and friendly face for them to vent to. Sara: I make a conscious choice to spend time with clients of diverse profiles to really understand their aspirations and how they want to shape their organizations beyond a particular engagement.  I use that insight to offer perspective on how they can get there including flagging to their leaders how they can be helpful to that persons’ journey. Many times though, I just try to listen and create a space where they can put down whatever mask they are holding up for a few minutes. We all need that space of relief so we can keep doing the hard work of forging new paths. Finally, in your view, where can organizations make the greatest progress on diversity and inclusion right now? Gayatri: If we all wait for organizations to get it right, we will fail. Ultimately, an organization is a collection of people. Leaders and managers need to role model and get in front of this issue. If they can find ways to let women on their teams know they matter and are supported and appreciated, that’s when we’ll see real change. Sara: The biggest change over the last year and a half is people’s willingness to discuss the issues and try to take more action to address them. What’s important now is that we don’t lose the focus, commitment, and accountability that the past year has brought us. related A McKinsey leader unites women in tech to prepare for the future of work How we’re building the next generation of Black executive leaders Never miss a story","Partners Gayatri Shenai and Sara Prince are committed to advancing women of color in the workplace, especially post-COVID.

Guangyu is co-leader of Equal at McKinsey, McKinsey’s global network for LGBTQ+ colleagues. Here, he reflects on courage, representation, and allyship. You were born in China but have studied and worked in several countries, including the U.S. and Canada. How has that shaped your perspective on diversity and inclusion? I had planned to go to university in Canada or the U.S. Back then, half of the motivation came from a chance to be my true self. At the time, I perceived those countries to be more open, and my choice to study at McGill ended up opening my mind in ways I couldn’t have expected. For the first time in my life, I was part of an association for gay and lesbian students, and the group had lively weekly discussions that were fascinating to me. I left China in 1989, and the notion of being able to come out at that time felt like a privilege. I was wowed when, in my first days at McGill, I got the student handbook and it had a section on safe sex education, the directory listings of all the student organizations, and then all the discussions going on in the college newspaper. You just can’t imagine what it was like for me. It was like opening up a joy box. When I came out to my family in 1995, they were so worried. Back then, pretty much everybody I knew associated being gay with AIDS, because most of the newspaper articles, especially the newspaper articles in China, reflected that. So when I heard that McKinsey was recruiting at places like Harvard Business School, I was thrilled. When I got my offer, I couldn’t wait to share that precious news with my family and my friends. It was like, “Hey, you know it’s really not what you think. You don’t have to worry that I might not be able to get a good job.” It meant a lot to me—a lot, lot more than people could imagine today. What was it like to come out at McKinsey? I went through a few stages. When I first decided to bring my significant other to a retreat as a second-year associate, many close friends outside the firm were saying, “Are you ready to ruin your career?” They wanted to make sure I was ready for anything that might come next. But I thought, this could go one of two ways. On the one hand, it could ruin my career. And if it had, I would have been happy to leave. I don’t need to stay in a place where I work hard but can’t feel comfortable with who I am. But on the other hand, I might find a place that embraced me, and I might go on to spend a significant chunk of my career there. It turned out to be the latter—and I’m so happy it did. And then you went on to co-lead Equal at McKinsey globally. After I came out, I heard from colleagues who were scared to do the same or skeptical of the response they would get. It underscored how important it is to have allies. I’ve especially been excited to get involved with local Equal at McKinsey chapters around our different office locations. It’s incredibly rewarding to be able to help people feel more comfortable at work, and it’s crucial for attracting talent, so it carries both personal and professional meaning to me. Who have been some of your biggest allies at the firm? The firm has been supportive as a whole over many years. One of our earliest supporters was Kevin Sneader. He talked about it with me in Hong Kong long before his election to managing partner. I remember he said, “If we want to do this right, we better do it in a very big, bold way, rather than small incremental changes.” That made a huge difference. Right after his election, we decided to have the first-ever global Alliance , a McKinsey-led gathering for LGBTQ+ business executives. Then we had a global Equal at McKinsey conference for colleagues. I immediately sent invitations to Kevin. Within the day, I got a confirmation from him, saying he would give it his priority. And he did. We’ve made a lot of big strides as a result of Kevin’s leadership, and we’re so excited knowing this is one of Bob Sternfels ’s priorities as well—and to continue our progress under his upcoming tenure as global managing partner. You and Diana Ellsworth, a fellow Equal at McKinsey co-leader, recently sent a personal note to the Asians at McKinsey group about the racist attacks their communities have been suffering. What prompted that? Diana and I have both experienced being a minority during our lives. And during my time in North America, I experienced being a dual minority of sorts. It shouldn’t be left to any individual community to defend itself. It’s in our collective interest to show up for each other with concrete action and to come together in solidarity. And this is very much in the tradition of McKinsey—we’re a global firm, not just because we work in places around the world. Our people are part of communities around the world, so it’s imperative we support them. I know personally how meaningful it is to be able to bring your whole, authentic self to work, and I want to ensure our colleagues globally feel empowered to do so as well. related To celebrate National Coming Out Day, five McKinsey colleagues talk identity and inclusion Never miss a story","Guangyu Li, co-leader of Equal at McKinsey, reflects on his journey from China to a supportive LGBTQ+ environment in North America.

Four lessons in business-building from our work with Tech for Good innovators,"From the team supporting Nesta’s Rapid Recovery Challenge semifinalists, tips on scaling for social good.",2021-04-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/lessons%20in%20business%20building%20from%20tech%20for%20good%20innovators/techforgood-hero-small-1058881454-1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/lessons-in-business-building-from-tech-for-good-innovators,"Four lessons in business-building from our work with Tech for Good innovators Focuses on digital innovation and is a strategic advisor to banking, fintech, and Tech for Good organizations on scalability and growth. Coleads the Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice in the UK and Ireland; leads digital and growth transformations in both B2C and B2B environments. Focuses on value proposition for fintech startups in UK and Europe. Supports founders and tech businesses to grow and reach financial sustainability. April 9, 2021 The Tech for Good movement is all about applying technology to areas like job security, health, education, safety, and elsewhere to improve lives and livelihoods. Nesta, one of the UK’s leading innovation foundations for social good, launched their Rapid Recovery Challenge in September 2020 to identify and support organizations that promise to improve access to jobs and financial stability for people living in the UK, focusing particularly on those impacted by the economic shock delivered by COVID-19. For the last two months, we have supported Rapid Recovery Challenge semi-finalists pro bono by helping them refine their value propositions, plan their customer distribution, and review their business models. To them, success means social impact. Sustainable scalability and ‘reach’ were at the core of these conversations; the more support to vulnerable users, the higher the potential for impact on people’s livelihoods and career development. When we asked them, ‘What does success mean for you?’ many said their core focus was to reach and help as many people as possible with their solution. To them, success means social impact. What consistently stood out from our workshops with social entrepreneurs was the passion of the founders and their teams. They are driven by missions bigger than themselves and dedicate their entire energy to support the most vulnerable. This energy and willingness to serve others is contagious. As we await the announcement of the challenge’s finalists next month, we wanted to share what we’ve learned through these conversations in hopes of helping other Tech for Good innovators scale their solutions and bring the greatest good to the greatest number of people possible. Tech for Good: Helping the United Kingdom improve lives and livelihoods Know your customers; understand their needs and where their attention is. Your customer base is often not a single, homogenous group. The wider the group you aim to serve, the harder the path, but you don’t need to serve everyone at the same time. To improve effectiveness, organizations can focus on specific customers, reverse engineer their specific needs, and map where their attention is. This simple exercise refocuses the effort of the organization into what really matters for their target users. For instance, a semi-finalist was targeting a very wide group of users, some of whom were more tech-savvy than others. As such, they decided to explore non-digital channels, too, in order to adapt and optimize their outreach impact. Do less to do more, especially where it matters. Understanding where to best direct your limited resources is a difficult art to master. This is especially the case when you are in an early stage of your organization’s maturity, when resources are limited and a clear product or solution has not yet emerged. Many of the semi-finalists (and a lot of companies) have a number of great ideas they could potentially test in unlimited directions. But given the limits of time and resources available, what is often required is bold focus on fewer options, establishing a roadmap, executing step by step, and adapting the plan if needed. Yes, you can do anything—but not everything at the same time. When partnering with other organizations, be a value-provider for them—and their network. When scaling a Tech for Good organization, take the time to identify potential partners who share your mission and values. Think about how you can help them — whether it’s developing a product, an initiative for their employees, or a joint campaign that will publicly demonstrate how they live the values you both share. If you find how to contribute to their journey, you may find inroads to a relationship. And when you do, don’t be afraid to ask for their help finding more partners among their suppliers, distributors, retailers, media agencies, or other organizations they know who might be interested in working with you Your users’ voices are a living proof of the value of your solution. Stories from satisfied users are rewarding for you and your team; they’re also a useful metric of success. As you see your product fulfilling its mission, you can use feedback from your customers both to understand the impact you create and as testimonials demonstrate the power of your solution. The individual stories of your team members are likely to become the shared story of the organization. Learn how to read them, identify your unique strengths, and communicate them loudly. These tangible, impact-oriented, real-life stories are what make your product distinctive—and memorable. A 2020 McKinsey.com article described how Tech for Good innovations offer innovative paths to drive sustainable and inclusive economic growth over the next decades, while improving key aspects of societal living. All of the semi-finalists we worked with on this initiative drove this home in a powerful way.

"This year, we aim to welcome more new colleagues than ever before","We&rsquo;ve broadened our search for exceptional people who can help us serve clients in technology, change management, design, and much more.",2021-02-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our People,Recruiting",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/welcoming-more-new-colleagues-than-ever,"This year, we aim to welcome more new colleagues than ever before February 23, 2021 This year may see many of us transition into the next normal, and for more people than ever, we hope that shift will include embarking on a McKinsey career. In 2021, we aim to hire more new colleagues than at any time in our 96-year history. Together, they’ll fulfill dozens of different kinds of roles across cloud, data, and software engineering; implementation and change management; user and product design; business presentation support; and, naturally, strategic consulting. “We’re growing and have seen that during this time of such uncertainty and change our clients have sought our support and advice more than ever,” says Brian Rolfes, the McKinsey partner who heads our global recruiting. “We opened two new locations in 2020 - Nuremberg and Santo Domingo - building on the 40 we opened in the last decade. We welcomed more than 5,000 full-time colleagues and 1,500 interns globally in 2020. And we recently acquired a new cloud consulting firm .” That growth will help us better serve clients across a wide range of business functions, and it’s also helping us build a more diverse and inclusive firm that better reflects the communities in which we live and operate. We’ve expanded our recruiting strategy to include more historically Black colleges and universities in the US. “We are in a movement, not a moment,” says Roselyn Cason-Marcus, an associate director of recruiting and senior McKinsey Black Network hiring and retention. “Our leaders and our teams are working together, pushing forward, to create an even more inclusive environment where distinctive Black talent feels welcome and can thrive.” Overall, we search for and find talent at a growing number of institutions — more than 370 schools last year — and hire talented experienced professionals from industry, academia, tech, and the sciences. 2020 tested our firm, as it did every organization, in a range of ways. Our top concern was and remains the health and safety of our people, who we supported through several wellbeing programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the ability to work side-by-side with our clients onsite vanished overnight, forcing us to quickly adapt to virtual and remote settings. Whether we’re helping clients navigate COVID-19, protect the environment, fight for racial equality and inclusion, or lead the way in technical solutions, the efforts of McKinsey colleagues matter. During that time, as the stay at home orders were unfolding, we honored our outstanding full-time and intern offers. More than 1,000 interns globally—including more than 500 in our North American offices—were onboarded virtually, trained remotely, and connected with project teams that provided authentic McKinsey experiences. “After joining, my virtual onboarding was smooth and professional,” said Ikram Mecheri, a business analyst in our Montreal office. “I received all my IT equipment a week before my start date, so I was ready on day one. Several colleagues reached out to welcome me and make me feel at ease. I immediately felt at home.” We have been recruiting for our summer 2021 interns and are excited and ready to welcome them in whatever virtual or hybrid fashion COVID-19 will allow. Last year saw us strengthen our client selection process and due-diligence efforts to help ensure that we create positive, enduring change in all our work. In response to COVID-19, we helped several organizations save lives and livelihoods by tapping into the expertise and experience of colleagues who are experts across a range of critical areas, including public health, healthcare operations, vaccines development, manufacturing and supply chains, and more. Elsewhere, among several sustainability efforts, we worked with the World Economic Forum’s Nature and Net Zero initiative to analyze how to create a voluntary carbon market of unprecedented scale to help combat climate change. And we are now one of 61 organizations that will share metrics focused on “people, planet, prosperity, and governance” as part of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative. The murder of George Floyd galvanized our commitment to anti-racism. In June, we committed to 10 Actions for advancing racial equality at work, and during the Davos Agenda this January, we became a founding member of the World Economic Forum’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business initiative, a new global coalition dedicated to fighting racism in the workplace. Our 10 actions toward racial equity Our work to find the best talent wherever it resides will accelerate over the coming months. For now, most of our recruiting events and interviews—like most of our client work—will be conducted virtually, as we follow local government requirements and health authority best practices to put the safety, health and well-being of our candidates and colleagues first. But even in a virtual world, says Brian, there remains perhaps no better place to work on challenges facing the world and organizations today. “Whether we’re helping clients navigate COVID-19, protect the environment, fight for racial equality and inclusion, or lead the way in technical solutions,” says Brian, “the efforts of McKinsey colleagues matter.” related Build a reef?

Photo by Andrew Eckmann December 11, 2020 Today we launch the fourth part of our knowledge partnership with CNBC, on sustainability, as senior partner Dickon Pinner discusses the importance of making economic and environmental resiliency core to the COVID-19 recovery. Our research shows that a low-carbon recovery could not only significantly reduce emissions, but also create more jobs and economic growth. As Dickon explains, the next decade is decisive for climate action: Warmer temperatures over the next ten years will bring greater risk of physical and economic hazards. And after 2030, the pace of warming depends on human actions, requiring a collaborative response to reach net zero emissions by 2050. We spoke to Dickon, who leads our global Sustainability practice , about the extent of climate change’s risks, how organizations can transform to become more sustainable, and why a green post-pandemic recovery is critical on the path to the next normal. The challenge of climate change 1. Why is a green recovery critical on the path to the next normal? Confronting climate change was critical even before COVID-19. Now, as we work to protect lives and livelihoods from both the public-health and economic crisis as a result of the outbreak, investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive the post-pandemic recovery by providing significant near-term job creation and increasing economic and environmental resiliency for the long term. Research has shown that climate change can actually contribute to pandemics . For example, rising temperatures can create favorable conditions for the spread of certain infectious, mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. Addressing climate change now can help us become more resilient for the future. 2. In the CNBC video, you share that a utility player could save $1 billion over 20 years by investing in climate resilience. Given this potential economic impact, why is change still so hard? For new players, I’m not sure change is so hard. We’ve seen that capital markets are wide open for investment in green businesses in a way that they’ve never been before: Interest rates are at historical lows, technology costs have fallen, and financial regulators are beginning to nudge investors, so the risk-reward equation is beginning to shift. These new companies won’t likely struggle to attract capital, but talent—and getting the right people and capabilities in place. For incumbents, there can be an inertia from doing things a certain way. A number of things have to be reallocated to change: Leaders have to move capital away from day-to-day business to something new, free up people to manage and implement that new approach, and have a shift in mindset in the way they assess climate-related risks. Organizations frequently don’t have these capabilities in place—and moving large capital from one area of the business to another can be confusing for shareholders—so it’s a difficult challenge. 3. How, then, do you counsel CEOs to act to prevent the risk climate change poses not only to their businesses—but society at large? It’s so important that companies have a complete and granular understanding of how their own businesses are shaping climate change. Without that, leaders are likely over-exposed to the risks, such as physical climate threats to their infrastructure or falling demand for their products, and underexposed to opportunities around approaches, like building resiliency in their operations, investing in innovation, or reducing emissions. Climate change is already having socioeconomic impacts in some specific regions. Our research has shown how disruptions will impact workability, livability, assets, infrastructure services, food systems, and natural capital. It all relies on a stable climate, which we do not have. That’s why courageous leadership is needed like never before—and that’s across industry, regulation, tech, and capital. We’ll need the creativity and dynamism of business to be an engine for innovation and delivery. We’ll need finance to mobilize capital, reward productivity, and price risk. And we’ll need thoughtful regulation to direct market forces and solve equity issues. 4. In which industries can a more sustainable approach to business have the most impact? Perhaps the unsurprising answer is: all of them. The entire global economy needs to transition to avoid the most serious effects of climate change in the future. To give an example, agriculture may become the “new Oil & Gas.” As the world’s eyes turn to the inefficiencies in the food and land use industries, agriculture will become increasingly recognized as one of the big untapped decarbonization and negative emissions levers. I also think that insurance markets will grow and change significantly . The world is overexposed to the risk of climate change, and underinsured, driving innovations like parametric pricing, insurance-linked securities, and public-private partnerships to manage their exposure. 5. What are some of the ways we’re working with clients that you’re most excited about? We recently worked with a global retailer to do a physical assessment of its nearly 10,000 stores. We looked at the physical climate risks to the company’s assets, but also the commodities and supply chains feeding those assets. We uncovered that the main source of vulnerability were actually the people and materials flowing into and out of its stores—and that the way to address that risk was to diversify its supply chain and invest in new technology that would be more resistant to the risks we identified.

Partnering with Rethink Food to create a more equitable U.S. food system,"With more Americans facing food insecurity, a McKinsey team based in New York City helped create a program to safely feed people while keeping restaurants running.",2020-11-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/partnering%20with%20rethink%20food%20to%20create%20a%20more%20equitable%20us%20food%20system/rethink-hero-small-team-1536x864.jpg,"COVID-19,Inclusive Economy,Social Impact,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/partnering-with-rethink-food-to-create-a-more-equitable-us-food-system,"Partnering with Rethink Food to create a more equitable U.S. food system November 2, 2020 Prior to COVID-19, an estimated 37 million Americans were food insecure, with limited and uncertain access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods. Since the start of the outbreak—due to the pandemic’s impact on jobs—nearly 17 million additional people now face food insecurity in the U.S., accounting for a 46 percent increase. The effects of this crisis have been felt across the country, and in cities where larger restaurant cultures exist, they have been particularly grim. Among them is New York City. A shelter-in place-order from mid-March through early June saw thousands of restaurants suddenly close and leave millions of people out of work. “This had an almost immediate trickle-down effect on so many other areas,” says Jill Zucker , a McKinsey senior partner and leader of the New York office. “During April, food pantries and soup kitchens suddenly reported running out of food with a spike in first-time visitors.” In an effort to support and give back to this community, Jill and other McKinsey colleagues from the New York office quickly formed a team and began pro-bono work with the non-profit Rethink Food . Historically, the non-profit had worked with restaurants and corporate cafeterias to donate their excess food to community-based organizations. “When COVID-19 began, we wanted to find the best way to use our capital to feed people safely while keeping businesses running,” says Matt Jozwiak , founder and CEO at Rethink Food. To provide immediate short-term support to industry employees, McKinsey and Rethink Food developed Rethink Certified , a program where participating restaurants commit to making a certain number of meals in their kitchens each week, over a twelve-week period, which then get donated to community-based organizations. “As a native New Yorker, it was painful and scary to see the pandemic’s impact on this city—both from a humanitarian and livelihood perspective,” says Tejas Shah , an associate partner at McKinsey. “On a personal level, watching my wife on the frontlines as a physician made me feel even more compelled to find a way to help any way I could.” From April through July, Rethink Food raised $10 million to fund Rethink Certified. Not only did those contributions support two million meals made across 40-plus restaurant partners, they also helped create over 100 jobs. “Our goal is to create lasting change in our communities, and the Rethink Certified model will feed those in need while helping to stabilize restaurants—not just in times of crisis,"" says Matt. “As a former culinary professional, I see the benefit of the additional, predictable revenue stream restaurants will receive to prepare meals for their local community based organizations.” Food security “My background is in cooking,” Matt explains, “so having a team that could help structure what the program would look like and help answer questions about which restaurants should participate, or how to match restaurants with community organizations in an efficient way, was critical.” In addition to helping scale the Restaurant Response Program quickly, the McKinsey team helped  Rethink Food redesign its organizational structure. “To keep up with all the changes they were pursuing, Rethink Food needed to make a number of key hires to give Matt leverage  and support the organization's exponential growth,” says Doug Patterson , an engagement manager at McKinsey. “Our team worked with them to define the organizational changes and process improvements that would be required to maintain their momentum.” By early summer, a new COO and CFO had been hired—two new roles to the organization. Elsewhere, colleagues from Aberkyn , a McKinsey company of change facilitators, worked with Matt to help develop his leadership style, manage his team relationships, and improve ways of working with the board of directors and other stakeholders. Once Rethink Certified was up and running, the team began work to help sustain its efforts—and create a more equitable food system at large. Doug explains that the certification program established a national ""always on"" source of meals for those in need. “By having a network of restaurants already in place, operationally set up and paired with community-based organizations for distribution, Rethink Food's partners can mobilize in real-time to meet elevated needs in future crises.""  Unlike the pressure food banks had from rising meal demands with COVID-19’s onset, scaling this type of program across the country ensures the right infrastructure will be in place for when we’ll need it. Similar to LEED certification for buildings, being Rethink Certified signifies a restaurant’s commitment towards a more sustainable and equitable food system. “Once you have it, you’re branded as part of the network—visible to consumers on online platforms like food delivery and reservation services,” says Doug. Additionally, the program includes a rating system whereby community-based organizations rate restaurants' performance to ensure they consistently meet program standards. “We’ve always wanted to bring restaurants and community centers closer to each other and felt this would help enhance the level of transparency between the two and ensure restaurants feel accountable for their actions,” Matt explains. Rethink Certified program participants must commit to making 50,000 meals a year and in return, Rethink Food will fund them $250,000. Since launching this summer, over 600 restaurants have applied to get certified. The first Rethink Certified restaurant was Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park where chef, owner, and Rethink Food co-founder Daniel Humm has praised the program for enabling restaurants to make feeding their communities a part of a long-term business model. “I don’t want to just cook for the one percent anymore when we know that 10 percent of people may not know where their next meal is coming from,” he says. “Any projects we do in the future will always have this in mind.” Rethink Food is now focused on expanding into other U.S. cities beyond the existing New York, San Francisco, Nashville, and Chicago locations. “We’re looking at the data that underpins Rethink Certified,” says Tejas. Through data from Rethink Food’s delivery partners, the McKinsey team will be identifying ways to further boost impact and get feedback from participants. One example is matching restaurants with community-based organizations right in their neighborhood to reduce the burden on the delivery component. “There’s so much excess capacity in restaurants and demand for a more food secure system in a post-COVID world,” says Matt. “Restaurants just need the capital to realize this, but this type of work will always be needed.” Never miss a story","McKinsey partnered with Rethink Food to address food insecurity exacerbated by COVID-19, launching the Rethink Certified program.

How are working women doing during COVID-19?

Our Women in the Workplace study explores. September 30, 2020 Today we release the 2020 edition of Women in the Workplace , the largest study of the experiences of women and gender inequality in corporate America. Produced in partnership with Lean In , the annual report, published since 2015, analyzes workplace data and the experiences of men and women from the previous year. The team began working on this year’s report before COVID-19. While the pipeline data reflect the end of year 2019 and predate the pandemic, the team pivoted quickly to ensure the final output would be relevant. “We rewrote our entire HR and employee surveys this past spring to best reflect the impact of the crisis on women so far,” says Jess Huang, a McKinsey partner and co-lead of the Women in the Workplace research. She explains that the longitudinal nature of the study will be particularly helpful next year. “Knowing that many companies made structural changes during and post-pandemic, we’ll be able to assess the impact on the pipeline,” she adds. We spoke with Jess on what the biggest takeaways are from this past year’s findings are. Here’s what she had to say: Women could be leaving the workforce more than men Every year since 2015, women and men at every level have considered leaving and actually left their companies at comparable rates. But the pressures of COVID-19 and the new work environment have completely changed that landscape. “It’s been surprising to see how many women are having such a difficult experience that they are considering stepping out of the workforce or switching to less demanding jobs,” says Jess. Women are 1.3 times more likely than men to have considered stepping out of the workforce or slowing down their careers—particularly mothers, senior women, and Black women. In the worst case scenario, if women leave the workforce at the rates they say they are considering, corporate America could lose over two million women in the workforce—more than the number of women who graduate from college and graduate programs in the US each year—and over 100,000 women in senior leadership roles in the short term. “This could potentially wipe out the progress we've made over the last six years,” she adds. Mothers, Black women, and senior women are feeling it the hardest Working mothers absorb a disproportionate amount of childcare and homeschooling responsibilities, and that double shift has grown to a “double double” shift. Mothers of children under age 10 who are in dual-career couples are twice as likely as men in the same situation to spend more than five additional hours a day on household responsibilities than they did prior to COVID-19. Meanwhile, one in four senior women has considered stepping out of or slowing down in their careers. “This is particularly concerning given senior women can have an outsized impact on diversity and inclusion at their companies,” says Jess. “Part of the reason they may feel so exhausted and always on is because they are more likely than senior men to champion diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and act accordingly,” she adds. “They are also more likely to mentor or sponsor women of color.” Black women are facing additional unique challenges from both COVID-19 and recent events of racial injustice.  They are three times more likely than non-Black women to report the death of a loved one as a recent challenge. “It’s critical that allyship — coupled with action — becomes part of the answer here,” Jess adds.  Our data show that while over 60 percent of employees consider themselves to be allies to women of color at work, relatively few take consistent action. Women in the Workplace Companies need to rethink work norms Next year’s pipeline data will show the impact of COVID-19 on women’s representation — both in terms of decisions companies have made in reorganization and potential attrition due to women stepping out of the workforce. Every year our firm has conducted this research, we’ve seen that attrition is not a driver in the difference between men and women’s representation, but this could be different next year, possibly as a result of the shift to remote work. “We’re really at a crossroads right now,” Jess says. “The data tell us that while there are some benefits to remote work, employees are also dealing with financial uncertainty, burnout, and mental health issues.” As a result, certain groups are really struggling, like working moms, Black women, and senior women. Companies are at a place where they need to be deliberate about redesigning this new workplace or else risk losing the women who are struggling the most. Work-life flexibility was the number one issue raised by survey participants regarding workplace inclusion by women and men last year. In fact, companies anticipate that increasing flexibility could allow them to better attract and retain diverse talent across different geographies. “This means rethinking some previous workplace norms,” says Jess, “such as what productivity looks like, or supporting employees’ mental health, or fostering inclusion in a remote setting.” Never miss a story","The 2020 Women in the Workplace study reveals that COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted working women, particularly mothers, senior women, and Black women, leading to a higher likelihood of considering leaving the workforce.

What does that mean, and what do these companies have in common? In a recent webinar hosted by McKinsey, Reid Hoffman , co-founder of LinkedIn and partner at venture capital firm Greylock, and Chris Yeh , co-founder of the Global Scaling Academy, offered insights. They explained that ‘serial business builders’ are organizations that relentlessly come with new ideas and spin them into scalable businesses—businesses that can disrupt entire markets by creating value in radically new ways. Being the first to scale is extremely important. And in times of uncertainty like COVID-19 the ability for organizations to move fast matters even more. Ari Libarikian , a senior partner and global leader of Leap , McKinsey’s business-building capability, and Rock Khanna, a senior partner and co-leader of our Marketing & Sales Practice in North America, led the discussion with Hoffman and Yeh on blitzscaling , a phrase the two use to describe the set of practices that enable companies to rapidly grow and beat competitors. The importance of speed and innovation is something we've also seen in our own work with clients. “The companies that have stayed at the top for decades are always regenerating,” says Ari. “They’re finding new sources of value, new sources of revenue, and creating new businesses. This is really a requirement to being successful today.” Rock adds that, even amid the disruption to global business caused by the pandemic, ""we have seen some companies outpace their competitors by acting quickly and launching new products and services in a matter of weeks that have typically taken years."" So how can executives blitzscale their organizations? Below are four tips from Hoffman and Yeh. 1. Act fast Speed matters. Now is the chance for businesses to make fast moves, and being first counts. This means prioritizing speed and deciding which actions must be taken now versus what can wait for later. Speed, after all, is relative to what the competition is doing. Today, technology is enabling every company to move with even greater speed. Elsewhere, markets are more global and hyperconnected, creating greater opportunities to blitzscale. Leaders should know blitzscaling only lasts a finite period: Only when competitors can no longer catch up should they stop. Blitzscaling: Business-building with speed and agility 2. Embrace smart risk Every good strategy involves risk, but it’s important to manage that risk as you go. Leaders must be willing to make and survive mistakes, learn from them quickly, change their minds, and embark on an ongoing learning journey. Decide which risks matter and should be taken, and use data from previous experiments to shape strategy. Uncertainty is a core part of innovation. Before doing anything, leaders need to establish a marketplace, market fit, and accept uncertainties. 3. Hire for adaptability People typically focus on financial capital at the expense of human capital. Yet it’s largely human capital advantage—people with experience growing companies from the ground up—that makes companies successful. Getting the right entrepreneurial people in at the right phase of a business is key. This means hiring in those employees who understand change is afoot and may not necessarily stay with the company forever. Hire who’s right for the role right now, not right for later. Make it clear what their specific mission is and what constitutes success. 4. Focus on winning First, determine where you stand next to others in the market and how that fits into your business model. As people navigate the ongoing pandemic, there’s an even greater need for flexibility and adaptability to move from survival to growth mode in order to leapfrog the competition. While the ability to scale quickly is often triggered and enabled by technology, it’s not always the case. Competitiveness of another player, for example, can also be an impetus to scale fast. No matter how analog or old-school a company, whenever there’s a chance for a winner to take most of the market, there is reason to rapidly business-build.

To help recent grads and summer interns navigate this moment and prepare for the next normal, our publishing team has collected our best thinking on thriving in the workplace into a single guide . “We had never done this before,” explains Mike Borruso , a McKinsey executive editor. “Young people graduating from college or starting their first internship are now finding themselves in a very strange time, and we wanted to welcome them to the world of work with some helpful information.” The idea was hatched as many students were heading into finals and graduation season. In the spirit of the firm’s new agile publishing model, which has produced hundreds of coronavirus-related articles since March, the team pulled together the collection within 48 hours. The articles, videos, podcasts, and other material we’ve put together will be helpful to anyone entering the world of work for the first time. “We went through all of the firm’s most popular insights content from the past few years, which includes hundreds of interviews with executives of well-known organizations,” Mike says. “The articles, videos, podcasts, and other material we’ve put together will be helpful to anyone entering the world of work for the first time.” Chris Konnari , who heads the firm’s web-production team, organized the material and laid out the page, and designer Nathan Wilson provided guidance on art. Our new manager of social-media content, Mona Hamouly , worked with Steve Lackey from our media services team to come up with a fun and creative video to promote the page on social platforms. The resulting collection includes 41 articles and 16 video interviews with leaders from organizations such as Girls Who Code, Pixar, Starbucks, and water.org. Some of the pieces cover pragmatic topics, such as making good decisions, running better meetings, managing time well, building great teams, and more. Other pieces, meanwhile, explore more theoretical questions: What is the meaning of work? What does it take to lead? How does your work contribute to society, and why does it matter? A number of the pieces in the collection were published in our pre-pandemic past. All of them have been added to the guide for the way they can help new workers thrive in a post-pandemic future. For example, AI, automation, and the future of work offers a bird’s eye view of how these technologies will reshape the labor market over the next ten years. The future is not what it used to be offers a vision of life and work after COVID-19.

As consumers demand virtual, customized, and sustainable products and services against a rapidly shifting economic backdrop, organizations are looking for insights that can help them capture more value in procurement, and even position the function as a source of competitive advantage. A new approach to digital procurement—Orpheus, a McKinsey company In early February 2020, we announced the acquisition of Orpheus GmbH, a leading provider of spend-analytics technology and a recognized innovator in digital procurement. We have now launched Orpheus, a McKinsey company, a new service that combines Orpheus’ advanced platform technology with McKinsey’s industry expertise and content-rich services in digital procurement. According to those closest to the acquisition, the new offering will help revolutionize certain aspects of the procurement process and give organizations a new way to create value. “We’re changing how organizations optimize procurement,” says Bill Wiseman , a senior partner in McKinsey’s Operations Practice. “The new combination of McKinsey expertise and insights with a world-class technology platform is unique in the industry.” According to Bill, we’re also changing the way we deliver that service. We’ve created a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that lets clients choose from a palette of options in creating a unique solution that suits their specific requirements. Whether it’s a building a one-off spend cube based on software licensing, or launching a full-service engagement incorporating spend-data processing, actionable insight services, and program management, the hybrid model allows clients to choose the exact level of service they need. “That flexibility,” Bill adds, “will allow a much broader range of organizations to access our benchmarking information—an exciting shift for both us and our clients.” The new offering also frees up capacity to focus on what matters most. “We’re going to be able to spend more time with clients on ideation, driving change, and actually delivering impact, while offering faster and better data analysis,” says Bjorn Uwe-Mercker , a partner in our Operations Practice. “And that will free up clients’ time to pursue other value-added activities. While we take care of the analytics and insight generation, users will be able to bring the human element to the fore and focus on negotiation and implementation, rather than crunching numbers.” We’re changing how organizations optimize procurement. The new combination of McKinsey expertise and insights with a world-class technology platform is unique in the industry. Orpheus’ CEO Jörg Dittrich and COO Michael Lauer were instrumental in making the acquisition a reality. They saw that the combination of our consultants’ expertise and Orpheus’s market-leading software could help create the future of digital procurement. “We couldn’t be more excited to be working together to make that future a reality,” says Jörg. As Pieter points out, that reality will be anything but dull. “We’re redefining a complex, underestimated, and undervalued discipline of procurement excellence,” he says, “and transforming spend analytics into an exciting and high-value activity.” Never miss a story","McKinsey acquired Orpheus GmbH to enhance spend analytics and digital procurement.

December 4, 2019 The winner of the 2019 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award is an investigation into how a gender gap in data perpetuates disadvantages for women across the world. Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men , by journalist and activist Caroline Criado Perez , delves into the ways data collection systematically ignores half the world’s population. McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader and Financial Times editor Lionel Barber presented the award on Tuesday, December 3, at the Park Hyatt Hotel in New York. Verizon CEO Ronan Dunne sat down with Barber for the event’s keynote interview. In the book, Criado Perez investigates the shocking root causes of gender inequality. Informed by hundreds of studies in the United States, the UK, and around the world, Invisible Women reveals a dangerous pattern that lurks in data and lays bare the consequences it has on women’s lives. “Unassailable facts, backed by powerful stories, are what move minds,” said Kevin. “This year’s winner brilliantly uses that combination to cast a bright light on one of the most important issues of our time.” The judging panel spent Monday deliberating the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. In addition to Lionel Barber, who chaired the group, this year’s judges included Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman at Mozilla; Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz; Herminia Ibarra, professor of organizational behavior at London Business School; Randall Kroszner, professor of economics at University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Dambisa Moyo, global economist and author and non-executive director at 3M Company and Chevron; Shriti Vadera, chairman of Santander UK and independent director of BHP Billiton; and Rik Kirkland, partner, global publishing at McKinsey. “ Invisible Women is a stunning book that tells people about sexism that is hidden in plain sight,” added Lionel Barber. “The data that Criado Perez marshals are overwhelming, and her call for action is compelling.” The Bracken Bower Prize for 2019’s best business book proposal by an author under 35 was also awarded on Tuesday night. The winner was Jonathan Hillman for The Sinolarity , which the judges called “a thought-provoking and topical analysis of the battle between the US and China for control over tomorrow’s technology and networks.” This marked the 15th year of the FT and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.

We’re thrilled to announce that our new visual identity, rolled out this February , has been recognized with a 2019 Red Dot Award in the category of Brand & Communication Design. This marks our firm’s third Red Dot this year after McKinsey Design in March earned two Red Dot Product Design awards for client work. We’ve written a lot about our firm’s embrace of design and how designers and design thinking are helping our clients. McKinsey has also published “ The business value of design ,” the most extensive and rigorous research undertaken anywhere to quantify what good design can do for businesses. According to global communications partner Steve John , our new visual identity is one example of how we’re taking our own medicine on that front. “We’re not the same firm we were even five years ago,” says Steve. “Experts in artificial intelligence, data science, and design of all sorts have joined McKinsey to deliver change that matters to our clients. Updating our visual identity was an effort to better align our firm’s look and feel with who we are now, and we’re humbled by Red Dot’s recognition of that work.” Director of brand communications Jane Goehring agrees. “What’s special about our firm is the combination of old and new: our heritage, which is rooted in our mission and values, and all of the new ways that we can help our clients create and sustain meaningful change,” she says. “Our new identity reflects that tension by embracing the idea of ‘high contrast’; which helps us cut through, and focus on what matters most.” The Red Dot Award , which works “in search of good design and creativity,” is one of the largest design competitions in the world and perhaps the most prestigious. For the Brand & Communications competition, 24 international design experts viewed and evaluated almost 9,000 entries from around the globe. Updating our visual identity was an effort to better align our firm’s look and feel with who we are now… The new McKinsey visual identity work has been overseen by our firm’s chief reputation officer Peter Dahlstrom and led internally by Steve, Jane, design director Elliot Cravitz , and brand communications managers Kevin Drennan and Lana Markovic , working in collaboration with brand consultancy Wolff Olins and the branding and creative agency OPX .

It all started when two graphic designers from Barcelona created a daily creativity exercise that became 36 Days of Type , a global design challenge that now partners with Adobe . This year, the project asked designers everywhere to come up with visual interpretations of the letters A through Z, and the numbers 0 through 9, and share them on social media between April 2 and May 8. The project caught the eye of Rob Mathis , a communications head with McKinsey Design . “We really felt this would be a great chance for us to showcase the range of McKinsey’s design talent and creativity,” says Rob. “We also thought our colleagues would have a ton of fun with it.” So, Rob put out a call for submissions, asking designers to loosely follow the McKinsey color palette so that all 36 characters would look cohesive together. But beyond that, people were free to do as they saw fit. “Our designers are often creating solutions within any number of constraints,” says Rob. “This project was more of a blank canvas, allowing them to show off their artistic sides. It’s fascinating to see the various ways each designer approached the challenge, and how unique and distinctive all of their output has been.” Almost 50 designers and graphic artists from across the firm, including client and non-client facing colleagues alike, volunteered to submit artwork. You can see all of their pieces right now, along with captions explaining their process or inspiration, at McKinsey Design’s Instagram account . Some of the illustrations are animated, like Senior Product Designer Kazumi Terada ’s stop-motion, claymation 9 that concluded the series. “The ‘professional art materials’ I had long ago in art school are gone and I’ve been mostly absent from making art,” Kazumi wrote in her caption, “but I am now surrounded by ‘kid art supplies’ like Play-Doh and toy pizza making tools.” Elsewhere, Design Lead Mohamed El Abbassi created a sharp, computer-animated M (for McKinsey, naturally). “M as in Motion, a medium we use to tell stories, present concepts, and showcase complex ideas,” Mohammed wrote in his caption. “Motion involves timing and spacing, rhythm and pace, a connected path that leads the eye and talks to the mind.” Others, meanwhile, took simpler routes. Yin Thum , a Junior Designer with McKinsey Digital, used a photograph of a pencil shaving for P . “P for ‘Pencil’ and ‘Paper,’” Yin wrote, “the simplest, most powerful tools anyone can use to ideate and create.” Earlier in the series, Lead Interactive Designer Megan Dweck produced a luminous, almost Yves Klein-blue I . “I for ink. I for idea. I for inspiration,” she wrote. “Design itself is a fluid process—you might start with a structured idea, but the creative journey leads you to a result you probably didn’t expect.” And Melanie Carnsew, a designer with our Brand Communications team, created a Rorschach-like image of a Q by splattering black ink against a cutout stencil on white newspaper. “How do you question?” asked Melanie in her caption. “No matter, just keep questioning.” This project made clear that creators of all kinds, both at our firm and beyond, are eager to answer that call.

Three solutions to watch in 2019,"Our three solutions focus on cybersecurity, organizational structure and real estate value – all intrinsic to strong business performance.",2019-01-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/3%20solutions%20to%20watch%20in%202019/3solutions-hero-wide_v2_1536x864_3.jpg,"Solutions,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/3-solutions-to-watch-in-2019,"Three solutions to watch in 2019 OMNI uses geospatial analytics to help retailers understand shopper behavior inside the store—and out. January 20, 2019 Solutions are the technology tools we have developed to help our clients analyze, benchmark, and use data in new ways. Over the past ten years, we’ve developed a range of solutions across industries and business functions, and as we start 2019, we believe that three of them may be particularly relevant to clients this year. From agile organizations to cybersecurity to retail channel planning, these solutions can provide insights that help our clients make more informed decisions. Two are used to diagnose organizations, evaluating structure and security, and the third helps retailers and other businesses maximize the economic value of their real estate. OrgLab: capturing an amoeba If an organization chart depicts the structure of a company, what does it look like when the organization is fluid, with three quarters of its employees rotating among teams? “Like an amoeba,” laughs Carolyn Pierce , director of product management. “‘ Agile organizations ,’ with flexible teams, will be the dominant new way of operating—so it makes sense that OrgLab reflects this.” OrgLab is our solution that helps organizations visualize their structure—and is often the first step when a company reorganizes, acquires a business, or undertakes a transformation. When introduced in 2014, OrgLab depicted organizations as boxes and lines in a hierarchy of reporting relationships. In 2019, OrgLab is being refined to depict organizations by the way the work gets done: through teams, by projects. It will help companies evaluate whether their teams are the right size;  do they have effective structures and skill sets; and leaders who are performing well. OrgLab also depicts processes: visualizing work flow and decision points. “If my most important activity is onboarding new customers, OrgLab can help me see where key decisions are being made,” explains Ashwin Acharya , senior solution leader. “Are they happening in sales? Finance? How many layers do they go up? How quickly do decisions happen?” Having served more than 300 clients in the last 3 years, OrgLab often provides a first-time, bird’s-eye view of an organization to its senior leaders. In 70 percent of our projects, they are surprised by what they learn, says Ashwin. For example, a large financial-services company discovered that it had more contractors than employees. A telecom found that 10 percent of its senior management reported to peers. A bank was overcounting its employee population by 20 percent. The OrgLab team today, part of McKinsey’s larger Organization Practice , has 40-plus people: software developers and data scientists who  create the product; org-design experts who scope, problem solve, and run client projects; and coaches and specialists who load and run data and train clients. They estimate that 20 percent or more of their work this year will focus on helping companies convert to agile methods. “Reorganizations take a long time. By the time you complete one, you need to start all over,” says Carolyn. “""If you do an agile transformation, it’s the last reorganization you'll have to do.” Cybersecurity:  first things first Cyberattacks, once a threat to financial firms and governments, are now universal, affecting any business that’s digital and connected to the internet. So it’s not surprising that cybersolutions are on our list for the second year in a row, this time, specifically, Digital Resilience Assessment . “In 2018, we have seen attackers become increasingly sophisticated, regulators laser focused, and companies becoming more stringent with their suppliers,” observes James Kaplan , a partner. “Cybersecurity has gone beyond being a technical issue to become organizational in nature. Eighty percent of what you need to do is outside the CEO’s office and integrated into basic processes.” This 360-degree benchmarking diagnostic scans a company, pinpointing vulnerabilities across seven areas. It answers questions such as: Once the assessment is complete—it typically takes a week or so—we can help the company put a plan into place, from securing data to investing in the cybersecurity market. The team has grown from zero to 50 in 2 years, and it brings together a mix of deep industry expertise and proven risk experience across a wide variety of scenarios. We expect growth to keep to the same pace in 2019. “Every company today wants to become digital, to use data and analytics in strategic ways. As a first step, you need the confidence that comes from effective cybersecurity—built into a product’s specs,” says James. “No cybersecurity, no digital, no innovation.” OMNI: retail therapy for an omnichannel world The “retail apocalypse” rolled through 2018, with nearly 5,000 stores closing—many of them well-known names—and it will continue through 2019. While retail networks may be shrinking, physical stores, in some form or other, are here to stay. Often they are evolving to new identities as product showrooms, “brand experiences,” service centers, or fulfillment locations. This evolution, paired with the fact that many digitally native brands, such as Amazon and Casper (mattresses), are building physical stores, means that traditional “four-wall metrics” of sales and profit will become increasingly irrelevant. Our OMNI solution builds on more than a decade of geospatial-analytics work and helps businesses fundamentally change the ways they think about, and operate, their sales channels—including decisions about their physical footprint. The solution incorporates large data sets in new ways to calculate interactions between channels, quantifying the “halo effects” that strongly influence the economic value of a store, adding or detracting up to 20 percent of its sales. OMNI integrates traditional geospatial data—such as demographics, mobile-phone foot traffic, and competitor locations—with internal business data. It is all fed through customized machine-learning models to uncover the factors that are driving performance in each channel, quantify how channels are interacting at a hyperlocal level, and help create the optimal cross-channel footprint for each market. “Retailers can make informed decisions about where to put stores, which formats to choose, how to use the stores to drive online sales, and even all the way down to fine-tuning store categories to meet the demand for that particular consumer base,” explains Nathan Uhlenbrock , a geospatial-analytics expert. “It’s become increasingly important be able to quantify channel interactions (owned and third party) at the micromarket level. We have a number of powerful use cases, including optimizing a store network, recapturing volume from store closures, and improving personalization,” explains Kelly Ungerman , a McKinsey partner. Looking ahead to 2019, she says, “We’re a global capability, and we completed dozens of projects in 2018, ranging from 1-week sprints to 6-month transformations. Every retailer faces these challenges, and few know how to tackle them—but those who do will win.” related Three breakout solutions of 2017 How to protect your business from a cyberattack Never miss a story","In 2019, three key solutions emerge: OrgLab for visualizing agile organizational structures, Digital Resilience Assessment for enhancing cybersecurity, and OMNI for optimizing retail channel planning through geospatial analytics.

There’s a playbook for bringing out the best in people, a sports page-turner about a data-driven underdog victory, and a humorous look at strategies gone awry. Talent Wins by Dominic Barton, Ram Charan, and Dennis Carey Dominic Barton, our former managing partner, made a habit of meeting with two CEOs or leaders almost every day for 9 years. “Knowing what you know now,” he’d ask them, “what would you do differently?” “Spend more time on talent,” was an almost unanimous answer and the inspiration for this new book, Talent Wins: The New Playbook for Putting People First (Harvard Business Review Press, March 2018). It lays out seven steps for managing people in a world that runs on gigs, works in real time, shifts shape regularly, and is digital, analytical, and technology driven. These steps include creating a troika of an HR leader, along with the CEO and CFO to lead the organization; focusing on the 2 percent of people who create the most value; and making people decisions based on data. The book follows up each step with real-life examples: Haier, a Chinese white-goods manufacturer, flattened itself into 2000 micro-innovation units, and Telenor, a Norwegian telecom giant, is boosting its tech-oriented senior leadership from 5 to 50 percent. The bottom line? It’s all about the people. Astroball by Ben Reiter, senior writer, Sports Illustrated Astroball: The New Way to Win It All (Crown Archetype, July 2018), is a gripping tale with two sets of winners: the losing baseball team that became a champion, and the data-quant team that helped it win. It’s the behind-the-scenes story of how Jeff Luhnow—a McKinsey alumnus (Chicago office, 1994 to 1999) and now general manager of the Houston Astros—and his group of data scientists used analytics to guide the team’s amazing turnaround. In a scant 3 years, the Astros went from the “worst team in half a century” to become the winner of the World Series in 2017. The book chronicles their efforts to quantify the human factors in scouting, coaching, and playing, and how they worked to combine hard stats with gut instincts. It’s also a story of building an analytics program from the ground up, changing the culture of a fluid and complex organization, and managing devastating crises, including a hack and hurricane, with lessons for all types of organizations. Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick by Chris Bradley , Martin Hirt, and Sven Smit It’s happened time and again: executives carefully put together a bold, thoughtful strategy that will catapult their company from the middle of the pack into the lead. The strategy incorporates market dynamics, creative thinking, and factual data. They walk into a meeting room to start galvanizing their team—a group of people with their own agendas, territories, and biases. Six months later, the strategy has been whittled down to a series of action points. But one in 12 companies do succeed in becoming leaders. Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick: People, Probabilities and Big Moves to Beat the Odds (John Wiley & Sons February 2018) outlines how the winners deftly manage the “social side” of strategy—organizational dynamics—so that they can effectively make the big strategic changes their company needs. It’s the first strategy book to wed behavioral psychology and data analytics. Best of all, it captures the painful moments everyone will recognize—in sharp and poignant, but very funny, cartoons.

The new analytics translator: From big data to big ideas,An expert in business. Fluent in analytics. Focused on results. Every analytics team needs a translator. Here&rsquo;s what we are doing to prepare the next generation for this critical role.,2018-04-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-new-analytics-translator-from-big-data-to-big-ideas,"The new analytics translator: From big data to big ideas Prudencio Pedrosa Grandes , a partner and the first analytics translator at McKinsey, congratulates Marta Matecsa, an engagement manager, on completing her training and becoming our 1,000th analytics translator. April 20, 2018 Three of the top five “most promising” jobs in the United States this year are high-tech data positions. But  not every role on an analytics team requires a math or science degree. “In fact, in the role of a translator, having a computer background can go against you,” says Prudencio Pedrosa Grandes , a partner based in Madrid who holds degrees in economics and business. He should know—he was the first analytics translator at McKinsey and helped to define the role more than 3 years ago. “I don’t have advanced programming skills. But I think logically and understand how to make analytics create tangible value in day-to-day business—that’s the crux of what the translator does.” In late 2013, Pruden worked on an early analytics project, helping a bank reduce its number of nonperforming loans—and he was hooked. Jump ahead to 2015, and data technologies such as machine learning were gaining traction. As demand for analytics work grew, the need for the role of a translator to lead projects was clear. An early goal was to train a group of some 200 translators, including delineating the role, establishing a learning program and defining a career path. This year, the translator program…with Carnegie Mellon University, will have graduated more than 1,500 translators in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Jordan Levine , a senior analytics learning manager trained in math and engineering, had joined McKinsey in 2011 after a stint in the Marine Corps. He, along with Pruden and Aaron Horowitz , a junior analyst at the time, quickly assembled 30 participants for the first learning program—“We got about 50 percent of the curriculum right”—and they have been refining the training ever since. This year, the translator program, which includes classes conducted in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, will have graduated more than 1,500 translators in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. “Translators come in with a wide range of experience,” observes Jordan. “We teach them a hybrid of skills essential to leading projects with analytics components. This means articulating a problem statement, identifying and collecting data, applying a modeling technique, leveraging the model to influence decision making, and capturing the value from better decisions.” In the classes, students can present use cases they are currently working on. “We’ve seen projects to optimize railroad use, improve the quality of corrections facilities, and even to find the most effective way for power companies to trim trees to reduce outages,” says Carla Vale , who started her career in physics research and now runs the learning program. So what do translators actually do? They have the traditional responsibilities of an engagement manager—leading a team, managing the project, and serving as the key liaison with the client. And they apply their domain expertise in an industry or function, using a deep understanding of the drivers, processes, and metrics of a business to better leverage the data. And, of course, they have a fluency in analytics: wrangling large data sets, understanding the ins and outs of various algorithms and models, managing “quant” colleagues such as data scientists and developers, and knowing how to turn data insights into concrete measurable actions. “Analytics projects are different,” explains Carla. “In other types of work, we talk about the 80/20 rule [the belief that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes], but not in modeling. There is no quick and easy answer—it takes time and painstaking effort to manage multiple, immense data sets. There are false starts, dead ends, and a lot of ambiguity. We have to find new tips and tricks so that translators can help their clients know what to expect.” We developed a model with an almost perfect GINI score…but it was a complete failure… Once the translator and client define which business problem to focus on, they have to identify the data that are the most valuable: “It is like opening a closet in complete disorder,” says Pruden. “We meet with different groups—business intelligence, IT, and sales, for example—to ask about the types of data they have. Everything is in different formats, measures different things, and is sometimes incomplete. What can create the greatest value? Is it usable? Is it relevant? How do we put everything together to build the model?” The translator then needs to know enough about the nuances of various models to ensure that the team solves the client’s problem. Pruden shares an early experience with a class. “We developed a model with an almost perfect GINI score. Data were accurate, current, and clean. It was beautiful,” he pauses, “but a complete failure because the model couldn’t be updated in real time.” Translators then help the client integrate the analytics model and data results into their ongoing processes. One sign of success, Carla points out, “Last year we extended our translator academies to several clients.  They have to know how to use the model themselves after the project is done and our team has gone.” This year, it’s estimated that some 25 percent of our projects will include analytics. Does this mean a promising future for this new role? “For now, yes,” says Pruden. “But the role of translator is transitory—in 5 years, we should all be translators.” Never miss a story","Prudencio Pedrosa Grandes, McKinsey's first analytics translator, highlights the growing demand for this role amidst the rise of data technologies.

"After 3 years of tackling youth unemployment, Generation has 15,000+ graduates—and counting","It&rsquo;s been three years since McKinsey founded Generation, a nonprofit focused on addressing the global problem of youth unemployment.",2017-12-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/15000%20lives%20transformed%20and%20counting/generation-tylin_hero_1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Generation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/15000-lives-transformed-and-counting,"After 3 years of tackling youth unemployment, Generation has 15,000+ graduates—and counting Tilynn recently graduated from Generation's retail careers program in Jacksonville, Florida; now she is a mentor for other Generation students. December 18, 2017 When asked to name a Generation student who stands out in his mind, Ali Jaffer, Generation’s COO, has a ready answer: “I just met her this past week.” Tilynn,  a student from Generation’s retail-career-advancement program in Jacksonville, Florida, like many Generation learners, joined the program from a difficult background, after cycling through several temporary jobs without feeling like she was building a career. “She came into our program and did so well and was so motivated,” says Ali, “that she has been hired by the Generation Jacksonville team as a mentor for others.” Even more inspiring is the fact that this isn’t an isolated example—it’s happened with other outstanding Generation students as well. In the 3 years since McKinsey founded Generation to address the global issue of youth unemployment, the independent nonprofit organization has brought new thinking to the workforce development space, graduating nearly 16,000 students across five countries. Many of these students came to the program with hardships that had disconnected them from the job market in a significant way, ranging from long-term unemployment to homelessness and everything in between. Generation is now the world’s largest program that trains and places young people in jobs. According to Generation’s global leader, Mona Mourshed , “Generation is now the world’s largest program, by annual volume, that trains and places young people in jobs.” These jobs currently span twenty professions across four sectors, including healthcare, customer service, technology, and more. Typical roles include certified nurse assistants, customer service representatives, and IT help-desk staff. Most importantly, Generation has developed a methodology and rolled-out a program that has a proven return on investment for both employers and learners—at scale, across a rapidly broadening set of geographies and industries. In the United States, Generation raised $10 million in grant money in 2017. In Spain, McKinsey received an award from Fundación SERES recognizing Generation’s impact in that country, where the program has helped more than 81 percent of its 1,000 students to find employment within 6 months of graduation. In Mexico, Intel has sponsored hackathons in support of Generation. “The more we do, the more we realize how much more there is yet to be done,” says Mona. “With every cohort, we try something new so that we continuously evolve our delivery model.” More countries, more programs After successful rollouts in India, Kenya, Mexico, Spain, and the United States, Generation is poised for geographic expansion in 2018—with confirmed launches planned in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. Discussions are also underway at various levels in more than fifteen other countries. Since this time last year, the number of Generation professions has nearly doubled—to twenty—with another five to ten in the works for 2018. And new partnerships and models are being created as well, with Generation embedding in employers in Mexico and in public-sector institutions in Kenya and India. Generation’s targeted approach Generation trains its learners through boot camps that run between 4-12 weeks, depending on the profession. Programs are heavily focused on the most important activities employees engage in and the curriculum is designed to make sure graduates can perform them at the highest level, starting on day one. According to Lauren Wein, a Chicago-based McKinsey fellow who has been leading Generation’s global curriculum and instruction team since January 2017, “If you look at other programs, they might teach a set of 20 skills you need to do a given job. What we look at are the five breakdown moments that differentiate low from high performers in a specific profession, and we are laser focused on practicing the skills learners need to get them right. This gets integrated into every single week and day of our curriculum.” For example, shift change is a “breakdown moment” for certified nurse assistants (CNAs). Doing this well involves technical skills like taking good patient-care notes, and behavioral skills like showing up on time for the shift, making a plan to see all patients before the shift ends, and knowing how to ask for help in case of questions. If CNAs cannot perform all these activities with a high level of proficiency, they will not be successful. Generation is also rethinking traditional assumptions around predicting a person’s success in a profession, preferring to focus its selection process as much on a person’s innate skills and talents as their educational background. For example, nearly one-third of the students in Generation Spain’s robotics process-automation program have a liberal arts background, challenging the notion that students need a computer science or coding background to be successful at programming robots. “It’s not about the academic background,” says Lauren. “It’s about your ability to show during the selection process that you have the potential to be successful.” And when it comes to skills, Generation’s curriculum reaches beyond the technical skills required to perform a job. “We also address the behavioral skills and mind-sets necessary to build a career beyond an entry-level role.” How McKinsey supports Generation Though Generation is an independent nonprofit organization, McKinsey continues to provide critical support to the program in the form of funding, knowledge, and people. McKinsey colleagues, like Ali and Lauren, can apply for a Generation fellowship, an experience Lauren calls “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a direct and powerful impact by applying what you learn as a consultant to this important global issue.” As Generation grows, so do its internal capabilities—something which inspires deep pride in its leadership. “Two years ago, probably 50 percent of the people in Generation were McKinsey employees donated on fellowships,” says Ali. “Now that number is less than 15 percent. McKinsey consultants are able to lead some of the strategy and business-development areas but also give some of those capabilities and skills to many others who are employed directly by Generation.” Never miss a story","Generation, founded by McKinsey, has graduated over 15,000 students in three years, addressing youth unemployment.

McKinsey and CEO.works: A new approach to managing talent,"Traditional talent management focuses on the top executives. But as companies realize their most valuable jobs are often dispersed, talent management is taking more of an inside out perspective.",2017-07-28T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Organization,AI & Analytics,Solutions",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-and-ceo-works-a-new-approach-to-managing-talent,"McKinsey and CEO.works: A new approach to managing talent The traditional approach to talent management focuses on the top-level, most senior jobs. But often, the highest value jobs can be found several levels down in an organization, changing the focus from the top down to inside out. July 28, 2017 In many companies, the top jobs sit on the top row of the organization chart. But this is changing. Research has shown that only about 5 percent of the jobs in a company today create 95 percent of the impact. And this 5 percent is different for every company—with key roles sometimes found deep within or on the outskirts of an organization. “To help clients identify their most valuable jobs, we start with their aspiration,” explains Sarah Pobereskin , an associate partner who is helping to develop the new Talent Management service line within our Organization  Practice. “How much do they want to grow? Which markets or products do they want to develop? Then, we can help them define the critical jobs and talent that they need to get there. It’s not unusual for a company to find significant gaps—complete sets of jobs they will need in 3 to 5 years but don’t have today.” To deepen our expertise in this area, McKinsey has formed a partnership with CEO.works, an advisory firm founded by Sandy  Ogg . Sandy has held leadership roles in HR for Unilever and Motorola, and he helped pioneer the concept of linking talent and jobs to the value they create within organizations. “Together, we are helping clients find their very best talent and place them in the highest value jobs— whether it’s one at a time, ten at a time, or a hundred,” explains Sandy. “This can be a source of true competitive advantage.” “Sandy is the person that CEOs and other heads of HR look to for advice on this topic,” says Chris Gagnon, senior partner. “We have been integrating CEO.works’ intellectual property into new tools and methods of working with our clients.” Sarah and associate Rahul Mathew describe helping a major industrial company that wanted to double revenues in 5 years, in part by expanding into Asia, through mergers and acquisitions and developing a digital sales channel. To meet these goals, the McKinsey team identified 35 critical roles, which, if not filled, would bring the business to a standstill. They included content developers, HR business partners, product officers, and service salespeople. “We could quantify the dollar amount of value each position brought to the business—a group of five positions would deliver nearly $20 million. This was an “aha moment” for the company—many of the roles didn’t exist, or were three to four levels down in the organization and weren’t getting the right kind of CEO attention,” says Rahul. The next step was to find the right talent for each role. One of our solutions , People  Analytics , helps organizations systemically and accurately define roles by analyzing publicly available ‘markers’ and data for such positions. The Talent Match solution can then assemble and connect the best talent to each role. “What was once a paper-based process of binders and static Excel sheets is now interactive and data based,” observes Mike Barriere, who recently joined McKinsey as a partner after serving as chief talent officer for Walmart and CHRO  for Alcoa. “Our Talent Match solution changes the conversation. We can see the implications of moving people around in real time, and decisions on candidates are made based on data and evidence rather than on opinions and impressions. And it can surface talent that previously may have been overlooked.” Managing to talent also means changing the way an organization develops and manages performance in those critical roles. Rather than annual reviews and one-size-fits all training programs, Chris points out that “skill building for critical roles needs to be dynamic, personalized, and reviewed at the CEO level.” While managing high-potential talent once meant focusing only on senior executives, now the conversation could be revolving around the talented user-experience designer, the local Indonesian sales manager, or the junior analytics expert.

Long term value: from intuition to index,"For the past 3 decades, leaders in business, government, and academia have debated whether the unrelenting focus on quarterly profits at the expense of long-term commitments has undermined the growth potential of companies and even the economy.",2017-03-17T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,AI & Analytics,Long-termism",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/long-term-value-from-intuition-to-index,"Long term value: from intuition to index March 17, 2017 For the past 3 decades, leaders in business, government, and academia have debated whether the unrelenting focus on quarterly profits at the expense of long-term commitments has undermined the growth potential of companies and even the economy. We believe it has. For years, McKinsey has encouraged businesses to take the long view . It underlies our concept of organizational  health developed almost 20 years ago: if a company manages only for its short-term performance—without minding its health—it won’t last. My ingoing assumption was that there were too many factors driving corporate performance—I was surprised,  in a good way, that we could come up with meaningful results with only five [factors]. To create long-term value, we urged companies to look beyond immediate product cycles and redefine their relationships with their customers, employees, and communities—to solve mutually relevant problems and protect resources. In a landmark 2011 Harvard Business Review article , Managing Director Dominic Barton outlined a road map for shifting companies to a longer-term orientation. We helped create Focusing  Capital on the Long Term , a global not-for-profit coalition which creates practical tools for companies, including a CEO survey last fall highlighting the pressures for short-term decision making. So while there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, it was clear that the best way to advance the conversation was through data. “We wanted to quantify what we instinctively believed to be true,” said Jonathan Godsall, an associate partner. A small team from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) was organized, and in 6 months they  developed the Corporate Horizon Index , a survey of 615 companies’ performance across five key indicators over 15 years. The index provides the first statistical evidence that shows the positive influence that long-term thinking can have on a company’s performance. “The hardest part of our research was looking for the less obvious factors that indicated a short- or long-term orientation. For example, there’s a myth that companies should have smooth earnings growth and meet quarterly earnings consensus. Long-term companies are not concerned with managing short-term earnings and are less likely to consistently hit earnings consensus or to have smooth earnings growth,” explains Tim  Koller , McKinsey partner and coauthor of the bestselling book Valuation , now in its sixth edition. For Jack McGinn, a recent-graduate hire with a degree in applied math, this was exactly his sort of problem solving. “We worked from hypotheses on how short-term decision making would manifest in a company’s financial disclosures. Then we created indicators based on these hypotheses and refined them so they could be applied to companies of different sizes and performance levels.” After conferring with external academics, they ultimately settled on five factors. Our Corporate Performance Analytics team began pulling the data across these factors—and in January, the index was ready. After running the numbers, it was clear that the group of 164 long-term focused companies performed significantly better than those 451 with a short-term lens. Their average revenue and earnings growth were 47 and 36 percent higher respectively, and they added nearly 12,000 more jobs than their short-term peers. Interesting to note, a small number of the companies even shifted from a shorter-term to a longer-term view over the 15-year period. A recent Harvard Business Review piece summarizes the findings of the MGI paper . So what gives some companies the vision and courage to make and stick with their decisions—despite tremendous external pressures? And how can we help others follow suit? We are conducting extensive interviews to understand how companies make decisions and identify the traits of those who take a long view, such as tenure of the ceo; employee incentives; values and culture; and the makeup of the board. “For example, one of the factors we are finding in outperforming companies is that they often set targets using a grassroots, bottoms-up approach—rather than top down,” says Tim. “They benefit from having more balanced view.”  One challenge will be how to get companies to start thinking longer term when they are doing relatively well now and don’t even think there’s a problem.

May 12, 2016 When Korea’s Chamber of Commerce wanted to understand how Korean companies could raise their game, it turned to our Organizational Health Index (OHI). More than 40,000 employees at 100 Korean companies have completed the OHI survey, yielding insights into working patterns, leadership styles, employee mind-sets, and, importantly, differences between generations and genders. The findings could help the chamber recommend ways for Korean companies to improve their management practices, productivity, and business cultures. Although this was the first time the Organizational Health Index had been applied at a national level, more than 1,300 companies around the world have used the tool since it was launched, in 2002. The OHI database holds over a billion data points, drawn from three million surveys completed by employees and leaders at these organizations. This massive data set allows the OHI team to create organizational-health benchmarks for companies in specific industries, geographies, and more. So, in plain language, what is organizational health? “It’s how you run the place,” explains Bill Schaninger, a senior partner in our Organization Practice.” It’s about the basics of what leaders do, how they align the organization against a clear direction, and how well they execute. It’s also about how they renew the organization over time to deal with external forces, such as new competitors.” Bill joined McKinsey, in 2000, after completing a PhD focused on organizational analysis and change. He was assigned to a team charged with finding out why some companies thrived over the long term, while others burned bright but fizzled. The team analyzed corporate performance over decades and across industries, conducted extensive interviews, and reviewed academic research. One basic truth emerged: companies that performed well over the long haul were managed for health as well as performance—their leaders were concerned not only with hitting quarterly targets but also with the organization’s culture and agility. Learn more about The Organizational Health Index The team set about converting these findings into a questionnaire that could measure organizational health and withstand academic scrutiny. The first iteration, designed for an Australian client, ran to 250 questions. “The biggest surprise was it worked right out of the gate. It gave us a pretty accurate picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the organization,” recalls Bill. With further refinements, the team cut down the tool to 100 questions and started using it to help other clients understand and strengthen their businesses. Over the years, the accumulation of data has allowed the OHI team to quantify the way organizational health contributes to financial performance. Healthy companies generate returns to shareholders roughly three times higher than their unhealthy counterparts do. They also identify the management practices that work for them. But there is no single path to organizational health. Instead, the data reveal four main “recipes,” or archetypes—bundles of related practices that increase the likelihood of creating a healthy organization. Companies that stick to a recipe perform better than those that mix management practices from different recipes. Adding further nuances, the OHI team’s recent work shows that the most effective management practices for an organization depend on its health at the outset. For example, the leadership behavior that drives performance in a company at the pinnacle of organizational health won’t work (and could be counterproductive) in a turnaround. The video below explains this data-driven take on “situational leadership.” For most McKinsey clients, the OHI is an annual survey allowing executives to track the health of their organizations over time. The launch of two alternative versions makes the tool available in new ways. OHI Live, now in pilot, puts one question a day to employees, helping a company to capture fluctuations in their attitudes and to track responses to specific events. A subset, myOHI, designed for small and midsize organizations, is available online at no charge as a self-serve platform. The Korea Chamber of Commerce and other projects promise to add a third new option for exploring organizational health: the opportunity to compare companies across a peer group. “If building healthy organizations was simple, everyone would be doing it already,” says Chris Gagnon, leader of the OrgSolutions group. “The work we are doing is needed precisely because it is hard.” Never miss a story","Korea's Chamber of Commerce utilized the Organizational Health Index (OHI) to assess over 40,000 employees in 100 companies, aiming to enhance management practices and productivity.

November 18, 2015 Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots , about the challenges presented by an increasingly automated future, has been named the 2015 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year. Dominic Barton, managing director of McKinsey, and Lionel Barber , editor of the Financial Times and chair of the judging panel, presented the award last night at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York City. “While no one can be certain how the future will unfold, this year’s winner delivers an important message: Companies and governments are racing into a world where both work and the workforce will need to be radically redesigned,” Dominic says. “Rise of the Robots is a tightly-written and deeply-researched addition to the public policy debate du jour and du demain. The judges didn’t agree with all of the conclusions, but were unanimous on the verdict and the impact of the book,” says Lionel. In his acceptance speech, Martin , a founder of a Silicon Valley software company, reiterated his conviction that the rise of robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence were challenges yet to be addressed meaningfully. “We could be at the leading edge of a huge wave. Machines and smart algorithms are starting to become adept at climbing skill sets and beginning to do the jobs of people with lots of skills and degrees. People think they do everything right. . .but they may still find it difficult to find employment. We thought the only solution was more training and education but that may not be so. And it may all unfold faster than we think.” The judging panel spent Tuesday deliberating the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. Judges for the award included Mohamed El-Erian, former Chief Executive of PIMCO; Reid Hoffman, entrepreneur and co-founder of LinkedIn; Herminia Ibarra, professor at INSEAD; Dambisa Moyo, director at Barclays Bank; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Rik Kirkland, our head of global publishing at McKinsey.

From left to right: Mark Dziersk, Gerard Furbershaw, Ken Wood, Jeff Salazar, John Edson, and Jeff Smith. June 1, 2015 It's no secret that design is increasingly a source of competitive advantage and business value. In a world of fierce competition, products, and services that are well designed—working better as well as looking better—have a critical edge. So more than 10 years ago we set out to build a bench of talent and tools to help clients launch new ideas, reengineer products and shape product portfolios. Today McKinsey is the world's leading product development advisory firm. The recent acquisition of design firm LUNAR adds a final, critical component to this thriving practice area. ""Until now we couldn't help clients with design execution,"" says Derrick Kiker, a McKinsey partner who led the acquisition. ""Bringing together top design, engineering, and business thinking in one holistic approach is going to be very powerful."" Creating business value through beautiful, ingenious and charismatic products is LUNAR's mission. Founded in 1984, the California-based company has worked with dozens of leading companies, including Apple, Nike, Siemens, Motorola, and Oral-B. LUNAR recently had to find space in its already over-stuffed trophy cabinet for a 2014 US National Design Award for Product Design, from the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Exploratory discussions about a McKinsey-LUNAR alliance or partnership started two years ago, says John Edson, LUNAR's president. As the two teams got to know each other, a full acquisition started to make the most sense. As you might expect from meticulous product designers, a lot of time was spent sizing-up the cultural fit—and finding it to be surprisingly neat. A quick look at John and Derrick's background underscores this point. One is a former US Navy submariner with a master's degree in design. The other trained as an engineer before taking a master's from Stanford University's joint engineering-meets-design program. Which is which? LUNAR's design team will also find more design practitioners than they might expect among their new McKinsey colleagues, including some leading thinkers in user experience design within our Digital Labs . ""We've been collaborating with LUNAR since 2013,"" says Hugo Sarrazin, who leads Digital Labs from our Silicon Valley Office. ""We've found that the expertise across industrial design and user experience design is complementary. We speak the same language and think about the strategic importance of design in the same way."" There are no plans, however, to move LUNAR's designers into McKinsey premises. In fact, some of our digital designers will relocate to LUNAR's hip digs in San Francisco. LUNAR's offices—in San Francisco and Chicago—will continue to operate at arm's length, serving the company's existing clients while also working on joint projects with McKinsey teams.

So why would a doctor change fields and become a management consultant? And why would a management-consulting firm need doctors? More than 150 medical doctors work in our teams around the world, and the number of medical professionals is even higher if you count nurses, researchers, and other trained medical personnel. Why join McKinsey? For most of our doctors, it's a combination of the desire to help at scale and an interest in institutional change. Alexander Ng, an associate principal based in Hong Kong, was formerly a cardiology trainee treating heart attack patients in New Zealand. To see the same symptoms day in, day out frustrated him deeply. ""It almost felt like you were at the bottom of a waterfall and there's no way you could stop the water from flowing,"" he says. He saw the great need for education and behavior change and decided to pursue a master's degree in public health at Harvard, after which he joined McKinsey. ""The only way you can try to [stop a waterfall] is to dam it upstream,"" he says. Ng now works on shaping healthcare systems with hospitals, payors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations across Asia. For Pooja Kumar, a principal based in Boston, an interest in international humanitarian relief pushed her toward medicine. After working in refugee camps in Azerbaijan and Zambia, she went to medical school and completed her internship, but she came to see medical training as just one piece of her broader interest in global public health. ""Over time, I realized that my excitement and energy for healthcare was really about the potential at a systemic level versus an individual patient level, and that's what ended up drawing me here,"" she says. Kumar joined McKinsey after completing her internship and has worked on a variety of US hospital and global public-health projects. For some doctors-turned-consultants, medicine is in the blood. Jean Drouin, a director based in New York, always considered medicine an option, even though he was also interested in business and international affairs. His great-grandfather, grandfather, and father were physicians. However, before attending medical school, Drouin joined McKinsey for two years as a business analyst. While he loved medical school, he decided to follow his interest in international institutions by completing an MBA and returning to McKinsey. His team works with clients to pioneer the application of technology and analytics in healthcare. Bridging business and medicine One constant for the doctors we spoke with is their ability to bridge business and medicine. Dustyn Baker, a senior implementation coach based in San Francisco and a practicing internal-medicine physician, works on the ground in hospitals across the United States to help implement new ways of working. ""Within a hospital setting, there are so many people to consider,"" she explains. ""One of the advantages of having a physician on the team is that I remember all of those people...I know that there's not just a nurse and a doctor—there's an OR tech, there's a scrub nurse, there's a chief nursing officer. As a physician, I know not only that these folks exist, but also the importance of incorporating their needs and views into any implementation plan we create."" Kumar's medical training allows her to empathize with other doctors and their patients. ""It's unique to have worked in the system, and to have known how frustrating it felt when you were on the ward overnight trying to make a decision about two or three equivalent drugs without the exact evidence about cost,"" she remembers. Drouin agrees. When he interacts with other physicians, they recognize a peer. ""What's been very powerful for us is having a mixture of clinicians and nonclinicians on our consulting teams.

In the fall, WIW predicted that 1 in 4 women might leave the workforce or take a step back in their careers—and that we were at a crossroads. We’ve since seen significant women in fact leaving. Does the research and report give us any indication on what is happening? Jess: Last year was the first year in our 6 years of this research that we saw women tell us they were considering taking a step back or stepping out at higher rates than men. It was a big red flag for us, and I think the facts since have unfortunately started to support what we were worried would happen. Our research tells us that unless we are able to help address some of these challenges that women face more than men, the women considering taking a step back or out are likely going to do so. Companies need to act now if they want to avoid losing progress they have made on recruiting and retaining women. Anecdotally, what have you been hearing from clients on how women are faring in the workplace right now? Are there helpful practices that you’ve seen? Jess: What we’ve heard has been very consistent with what the data in our report showed: Women are having a hard time. In particular, mothers are having a hard time juggling additional housework and childcare responsibilities, senior level women are feeling extremely overstretched, and Black women continue to struggle with feeling comfortable bringing their whole selves into the workplace. Eight months later, we are actually seeing even more employees cite burnout as the numbers one challenge. We’ve seen companies really double down on trying to help address these issues—offering additional paid leave days, mandating company-wide days off, and trying to offer more mental health resources. What are some of the questions and topics you’re keen to raise with companies for the report this year? Jess: I think we, like everyone else, are staying tuned to see what some of the impacts of COVID-19 have been, and how companies are thinking about not only the pandemic’s impact on diversity, but also the impact of the return to work–whatever that looks like for them–on diversity. It will be fascinating to see how companies are considering whether or not they are taking into account what this new workplace might look like for women. You’re recruiting right now. What would you say to companies who are thinking about signing up? Jess: I’ll leave this one for Ishanaa since it’s squarely in her wheelhouse.

November 11, 2014 We recently partnered with the Financial Times to support two book awards: the Business Book of the Year award and the Bracken Bower Prize for business authors under the age of 35. Thomas Piketty won Business Book of the Year for Capital in the Twenty-First Century . Shortlisted for the Bracken Bower Prize were three inspiring, business-savvy women with their fingers on the pulse of global business. The two runners up were Alysia Garmulewicz for 3-D Printing, Anything, Anywhere and Jenny Palmer for One Level Up . The winning entry demonstrated a deep understanding of global economics and gender in a Muslim environment: Saadia Zahidi's Womenomics in the Muslim World . Zahidi points to a disconnect in many Muslim communities between the high enrollment rates of women in higher education, which currently surpass those of men, and a culture that dictates that women must focus on the home. She reveals a hidden history of businesswomen in Muslim tradition, starting with the Prophet Muhammad's independently wealthy wife, who was a trader and completely self-sufficient. Zahidi reminds us that there are more than 800 million Muslim women, many of whom will enter the workforce as education and employment for women become normalized. The impact will be felt not only on the shifting cultural dynamics of the family unit, but also on the labor markets of many countries. Issues surrounding gender, organizations, and leadership in the Muslim world were addressed earlier this year in a report published by our Middle East Office— GCC Women in Leadership: From the first to the norm . Based on interviews with 50 women who are senior leaders and a survey of more than 500 men and women across the Gulf Cooperation Council states, the report focuses on the challenges and opportunities faced by women in the workforce, particularly women in leadership, throughout the GCC—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Find out more about the report on our Middle East office website . The Bracken Bower Prize is named after Brendan Bracken, chairman of the Financial Times from 1945 to 1958, and Marvin Bower, managing director of McKinsey from 1950 to 1967, who were instrumental in laying the foundations for the present-day success of the two institutions.

A clock and a key,"Real estate projects are measured in months and years, not minutes and seconds. But for Sangeeth Ram, the ticking clock is a reminder of the urgent need to provide affordable housing at scale in every region in the world.",2014-11-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"McKinsey Global Institute,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-clock-and-a-key,"A clock and a key Sangeeth Ram’s work in affordable housing is inspired by his childhood experience in India. November 24, 2014 Real estate projects are measured in months and years, not minutes and seconds. But for Sangeeth Ram , a partner in our Middle East office, the ticking clock is a reminder of the urgent need to provide affordable housing at scale in every region in the world. Every day, thousands of families migrate to different cities in search of a better life. Many struggle to find secure or affordable homes. By 2025, one in three people living in cities globally could lack an affordable home. The clock is indeed ticking. A clock Sangeeth understands the urgency at a personal level. Growing up in southern India, his family moved to three cities and five homes before he was 10 years old. His parents, worried that the constant moving would disrupt Sangeeth’s education, decided to take a risk. His father and mother worked for a state bank and managed to secure a loan from their employer—rare in the late 1980s in India—to buy a small plot of land on the far outskirts of the city and build a modest two-story house. There were only two other homes in the vicinity and one kilometer to get to the main road—“It was a desolate place,” Sangeeth recalls. But the family home was a springboard. Despite a long two-bus journey to get there, Sangeeth completed his education at a well-respected local public school. When he decided to pursue his education in the US, but still required money for expenses, his parents were able to take out a loan, using the house as collateral. Besides security, the house gave Sangeeth’s family the confidence and ability to take risks. It gave them an identity. A key After graduating from MIT in 2006, Sangeeth joined McKinsey. In 2009, a real-estate project centered on housing and city development took him to the Middle East. Suddenly, he could connect the dots: “Having this family home, I could see how it changed my life. Wouldn’t it be amazing if McKinsey gave me a broad canvas to shape the thinking on affordable housing?” Affordable housing is now at the core of Sangeeth’s professional practice, working with governments and private-sector developers globally. Wherever he travels, he makes a point of visiting housing projects and speaking to the people who live there. “How it touches individuals is the best part about being involved in this,” he says. “When you go and see the impact, it’s an unbelievable thing.” Yet the challenge is enormous. Today, more than 330 million families globally lack secure or affordable housing. This not only limits individual opportunities but also puts a brake on economic development. A recent McKinsey Global Institute report, Tackling the world's affordable housing challenge , coauthored by Sangeeth, aims to act as a catalyst for change by providing a fact-based framework for action. It offers ways to help build vibrant communities that enable opportunities for upward mobility. Increasingly, land is moving to the center of housing policy; in some cases, it is not about building new homes, but delivering better housing-related outcomes in existing communities. And yes, the key Sangeeth pulls from his pocket really is the key to his childhood home (pictured below). When he thought of sharing his family’s story, he asked his parents to ship it to him. Although his family doesn’t live there anymore, he’s been back to the area over the years. A canopy of trees now shades the house, one of 25 homes in a neighborhood absorbed by the growing city.

December 1, 2014 Most people know McKinsey has analysts. Strategists. Experts of all kinds. But did you know we also have hackers? McKinsey's Digital Labs sent a team of four twentysomething digital analysts to participate in the first hackathon sponsored by the City of Boston. The challenge? Streamlining the online permitting process for consumers and small businesses. The city processes almost 100,000 permit applications a year—permits to put up walls, to install plumbing, to serve alcohol, to claim a parking space, just to name a few. Each permit application can include up to 40 questions. The hackathon was a way for Boston to tap the tech community for innovative solutions to one its biggest ""pain points"" for small businesses. Ten teams participated in the 24-hour challenge including universities, professional hackers, and enterprise software companies. On the McKinsey team, Christine Miao served as product owner/designer, Catherine Lee was a designer, Matt Casey focused on the architecture and Neil Ni handled the back-end development. When the clock started ticking, most teams dove into the database design and coding. But the Digital Labs team fanned out—and spent 6 hours interviewing the very people most impacted by the onerous permitting process, who had been invited to the event to provide input. They talked to city officials, consumers, and business owners including a burger entrepreneur and the owner of Roxy's Grilled Cheese. ""A rep from Main Streets, an organization focused on small businesses, and a city manager actually walked us step by- step through the process of how they help users applying for a permit—as if it were two people sitting at a desk,"" remembers Christine. ""This was a critical conversation.We then translated their physical process into a digital solution they could be excited about."" The key takeaway from their interviews was clear: citizens wanted a consistent, reliable process that they could use for all of their permits, whether it was for building an addition to a house or opening a business. The team worked through the night and next morning developing their approach, sleeping only 3 hours each. They checked in constantly with their stakeholders for feedback by text, phone, and e-mail. ""The hardest part was knowing when to stop designing and start building,"" remembers Matt. Holistic, 80/20, and integrated ""Our solution was aspirational—rather than fixing the existing process, we created a single set of rules that could apply to most users,"" says Christine. ""We followed the 80/20 rule, developing for one of the most complex use cases—an entrepreneur opening a restaurant—so that what we built could be easily scaled down and optimized for most users."" The approach integrated the ability to identify and apply for the right permit, along with a tracking mechanism so a restaurant owner could monitor the multiple permits he or she would eventually need. They simplified the entire process, whittling 40 questions down to 4. The next morning, the Digital Labs team won both for their category and for the overall hackathon. Would they do it again? ""Absolutely!"" said both Matt and Christine. ""But it has to be the right opportunity. This hackathon hit the sweet spot of what we do at McKinsey in terms of user research and how we can represent data in a new way to solve problems for a large-scale system."" Next-generation consulting The Digital Labs is a new way in which McKinsey is serving clients: turning ideas and strategies into technical applications—fast. Started in 2010, the Digital Labs today has 300+ digital professionals including UX designers, full stack coders, data engineers, and agile experts. They work on a range of projects, from rapid prototyping to building tailored data-analytics solutions. The Digital Labs can also help organizations grow their own agile development skills in-house. They run 24 hours a day, with teams operating in 10 cities on four continents, often handing off projects across time zones to meet tight deadlines. ""Winning the Boston hackathon exemplified the design principles that make the Digital Labs unique…how we think about scalability, the practical aspects from the design side,"" says Hugo Sarrazin, a Silicon Valley-based director, who leads the group.

Jeremy Oppenheim, a director in our London office, spent 2014 on sabbatical, serving as program director for the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. The year-long assignment culminated in September with the publication of Better Growth, Better Climate: The New Climate Economy Report , a report that sets out to answer one of the biggest questions facing the world today: Is it possible to combine growing the economy with tackling climate change? The report received widespread media attention—and a shout-out on Twitter from Barack Obama. In many ways, the project perfectly united Jeremy's interests and experience. As one of the founders of McKinsey's Sustainability and Resource Productivity Practice , he understands and cares deeply about the issues. Plus, the commission's mandate was to develop an independent, evidence-based perspective—very much in tune with McKinsey's tradition of intellectual independence and fact-based analysis. ""Climate change is one of those classic arenas where ideology, on all sides, has a bad habit of trumping the facts,"" says Jeremy. ""Even bringing a few salient facts into the debate can be transformative."" As he found out, however, shaping the debate on the public stage is very different from serving clients behind the scenes as a consultant. ""The skills and disciplines you develop inside McKinsey are incredibly valuable—good up-front problem structuring, prioritizing against the big numbers, knowing when 80/20 is good enough, and most importantly, how to build high-performing teams. But the experience was a healthy reminder that so much more is needed beyond expertise or insight. There are other frames of reference—for example, how political deals get done, how the rules of the game get set, how media creates stories, how to use the language of ethics and morality—that matter in profound ways."" ""At one point I found myself on the radio with Naomi Klein, of No Logo and The Shock Doctrine fame. Her world view starts from the need for greater equity and a deep concern for the least privileged members of society. It's enriching to engage with people like her and explore how the market system is more likely to deliver the social and environmental goods which she rightly values."" Would Jeremy do it again? Yes, he would. ""It was an awesome, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to create a platform that, within a year, built enough legitimacy to influence and help reframe the global debate. And it's not every day that you work simultaneously with the leaders of Unilever, the IMF, the Chinese Development Bank, and the International Trade Union Confederation!""

The many faces of diversity,Our ground-breaking Diversity Matters report shows a significant link between corporate performance and the gender and ethnic diversity of company leadership.,2015-01-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-many-faces-of-diversity,"The many faces of diversity January 26, 2015 Our ground-breaking Diversity Matters report shows a significant link between corporate performance and the gender and ethnic diversity of company leadership. Fittingly, the team behind the study—London-based partners Vivian Hunt and Dennis Layton, and Atlanta-based partner Sara Prince—brought an incredibly diverse set of personal experiences and professional interests to the research. Recalls Sara: ""When I first started work, as a 20-something year old on a Wall Street trading floor, I was the only person who looked like me."" The experience sparked an interest in organizational dynamics that later led her to McKinsey. ""As a black female in America, I fundamentally believe in equal opportunity, at an inherently moral level. But I started to really question what is the business value of diversity and how do you actually achieve it?"" These are the questions that Diversity Matters starts to address. A sociologist by training (and former military cryptographer), Dennis leads our Organization work in London and has a deep interest in how management practices effect organizational performance. Among his previous research interests: contributing to an international study of the impact of hospital management practices on clinical outcomes. Bringing that same level of cross-border, fact-based rigor to questions of management diversity was a natural fit. Dennis, who is also a leader of Equal at McKinsey , our LGBTQ affinity group, points to some intriguing details among the data. For example, in the US the impact on financial performance of increasing racial diversity was stronger than the impact of increasing gender diversity, whereas the inverse was true in the UK. ""Hopefully we will get people to reflect on what is going in terms of how the dynamics are playing out in their countries. The performance numbers are really a proxy for decision biases and blind spots,"" he says. For Vivian, the research was a chance to further shape the diversity debate, building on the impact of our ongoing Women Matter research, which focuses on gender. As the leader of our London office, she also understands the need to ""walk the walk"" on diversity, keeping a check on her own biases. ""The challenge,"" says Vivian, ""is to manage bias by making the unconscious conscious. Similar to the adage that you can't manage what you don't measure, you can't change what you don't acknowledge."" She adds: ""The single most important thing we want people to take away from this report is that greater diversity on boards and top executive teams helps deliver positive economic performance and organizational health. This is a great breakthrough. For a long time—too long, perhaps—the debate around diversity has lacked economic weight. Hopefully, we've started to reshape the discussion in a meaningful and global way."" Many companies are eager to start the process. Says Sara: ""One of the things that has been interesting to me in this journey is that while the clients that we talked to at the beginning were excited to understand if there was a relationship between diversity and performance, they were even more hungry to understand how to actually achieve it."" The team is already planning additional research exploring the impact of other types of diversity, in more areas around the world—and the best ways for companies to achieve diversity in a meaningful way.

February 4, 2015 McKinsey is widely known for the quality of its training and professional development—it’s part of what motivates accomplished individuals to join our firm. But what if McKinsey-style training could be shared more widely? What if we could offer clients the same courses that help our consultants develop their skills? Welcome to McKinsey Academy . Over the years, clients had frequently requested access to McKinsey training, says André Dua , the McKinsey director who helped create McKinsey Academy. The rise of online learning made it feasible to respond in a systematic way. André assembled a multidisciplinary team—including designers, technologists, and adult-learning specialists—to create our very own digital education platform. McKinsey Academy courses blend video, gaming techniques, and social-media-style collaboration with real-life project assignments. Titles such as “Mastering challenging conversations,” and “Team management, mentoring, and coaching,” indicate that the curriculum is more than academic. “At the end of a program, people should do their jobs differently,” says André. “This is a ‘change how you work’ platform.” To test the market, the team started by offering a digital-marketing course, without using McKinsey’s name in their promotional materials. The response was strong: 1,200 participants signed up. Following further research, two main programs were developed: the McKinsey Management Program, targeted at rising executives, and the McKinsey Leadership Program, aimed at senior-level executives. McKinsey Academy officially launched with its first group of clients in the fourth quarter of last year. “Participants work in small cohorts on assignments and discussions,” says Jennifer Gormley, director of product design. “They offer feedback on and grade each other’s work while getting guidance from McKinsey teaching assistants—motivated colleagues from relevant practices who volunteer their time. It’s like real life, working in teams.” In one exercise, the supply chain of a fictional fast-growing supermarket is contaminated. The team has a week to identify the source of contamination, problem solve, and come up with a plan. Course participants may come from a single company, or they may come from multiple organizations. Many fast-growing companies have a pressing need to develop their next generation of leaders but don’t have the time or resources to invest in traditional executive education, observes André. This is especially true in developing economies where qualified managers are harder to find. What does 2015 hold? “We are seeing very encouraging early results,” says André. “In 2015 we plan to scale the McKinsey Academy platform dramatically and explore new digital learning techniques.” Never miss a story","McKinsey Academy offers online courses developed by McKinsey and external experts, blending video, gaming, and collaboration to enhance professional skills.

Meet our experts McKinsey crisis response, supply chain and logistics experts helped the Red Cross triple their distribution of relief packages in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. February 10, 2015 David Chia is not excitable. ""I have a deadpan delivery—which does not work so well in video or presentations,"" he admits. ""And I'll never be the cheerleader type."" But he is the man you want in a crisis. ""I believe this work plays to my strengths—I am methodical and remain steady and calm when people are overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next. I work with them to regain control,"" he says. Over the past 5 years, McKinsey's team of crisis experts has helped corporate, government, and not-for-profit clients through 50 high-profile crises including epidemics, natural disasters, and catastrophic operational accidents. While the timing of a crisis is not predictable, the way it unfolds is. David and other colleagues help clients understand what may happen next, what issues they need to be ahead of, and, equally important, what they can deprioritize as they struggle with limited time and resources. An Australian with a background in chemical engineering, David held line-management roles in oil, gas, steel, and rail infrastructure before joining McKinsey. He then helped a large energy company over several years to reduce their operational risks. This led to work on crisis response in public health, in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. He worked at the country level to help reduce and manage the risk of an epidemic. ""While the threats are very different [in energy and healthcare], the leadership qualities you need, the capabilities and resources you put into place, and the coordination and approach during a time of crisis are similar,"" he points out. Helping clients prepare for a crisis is very different from helping them respond to one, according to David. In preparedness it can be hard to motivate people to focus on implementation when they have pressing deadlines in their day jobs competing for their attention. ""In responding to a crisis, people often are overwhelmed by fear and unsure of what to do next, because everything seems important. They can't see the forest for the trees because they are in the middle of it. I sit with clients and methodically work out priorities and break them down into small steps. You can literally see them start to regain control,"" he explains. ""As they start to get small wins, the fear subsides and that's the turning point—they can begin to see the clear path forward."" Based in North America, Becca O'Brien Kuusinen has led recovery programs for some of the world's worst natural disasters and public-health threats. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, the most catastrophic natural disaster in US history, swept across the Gulf of Mexico and into Louisiana and Mississippi. In New Orleans, the levees collapsed and the city flooded. More than 1 million people were displaced, and more than 1,800 died, nearly half of whom were elderly people who drowned. Becca took a 3-year leave from McKinsey to work for the US Federal Office of Gulf Coast Rebuilding and then as executive counsel and senior policy adviser to the mayor of New Orleans. ""I got to see the situation from both sides,"" she remembers, ""and I was completely captivated by how hard everyone worked and nonetheless how difficult it was to make progress."" During her 2 years in New Orleans, she and her team helped develop the framework for coordinating the government resources earmarked for the region's long-term recovery. Following this experience, Becca focused her efforts at McKinsey on helping clients think through the issues of governance and operational mobilization during a crisis, how they actually run a recovery and response, and especially how to make sure they bring lessons learned from previous events to bear on the crisis they are facing at the moment. She adds, ""I can walk into the office of a leader who is in one of the toughest moments of his or her life, and say, 'You don't have to do this alone. You can stand on the shoulders of many people who’ve been in this position before and learn from their experiences. We'll face this together.'""

A sea change in how we use plastics,"Many environmental issues are so big that no single institution can tackle them. Take the leakage of plastics into the world’s oceans. By 2025, a staggering 250 million metric tons of plastic are projected to be in the ocean unless action is taken.

February 19, 2015 Many environmental issues are so big that no single institution can tackle them. Take the leakage of plastics into the world's oceans. By 2025, a staggering 250 million metric tons of plastic are projected to be in the ocean unless action is taken. That is one ton of plastic for every three tons of fish. Plastic not only harms wildlife and habitats through entanglement with larger pieces of refuse, it also fragments into particles that find their way into living organisms in ways we are only beginning to understand. The plastics found in the ocean come from thousands of sources across multiple countries, so no international organization, government, or company has the authority, expertise, or resources to address this environmental threat on its own. But Martin Stuchtey thinks that the right combination of stakeholders can tackle the issue. Based in Munich, Martin leads McKinsey's Center for Business and Environment , which aims to tackle global environmental issues by working with coalitions to develop a shared understanding across the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. Coalition partners in recent projects include the Ellen MacArthur Foundation , Ocean Conservancy , Rocky Mountain Institute , and Stanford University . Significantly reducing the leakage of plastic into the ocean from land-based sources is the center's next challenge. A geologist and economist by training, Martin leads McKinsey's work on green growth. A particular focus: water management and closed-loop systems. His work analyzing the true costs of how we use natural resources has already made waves. At last year's World Ocean Summit he laid out analysis showing that government subsidies for deep-sea fishing make no sense from an economic perspective because they lead to further depletion of fishing stocks. He has also helped drive work on the economics of the "" circular economy ""—an economic system run, as he describes it, ""like a forest; it grows while other natural systems thrive."" The Center for Business and Environment selects projects based on three main criteria. First, does the issue relate to one of its core themes: the circular economy, the future of mobility, or transitioning energy systems/ecosystems? Second, can the center help bring together a critical mass of stakeholders to take action? Third, can McKinsey use analysis to frame the issues in a way that makes a big difference and helps to unlock a solution? Martin admits that one of his biggest challenges is helping coalition partners and other stakeholders understand the role of the center: ""We are not a nongovernmental organization, but we're also not acting as consultants in the traditional sense. Our aim is to be an incubator of long-term, systemic change."" Says Martin: ""Plastic is a huge, interesting topic. It is the ultimate single-use material. Not only does it clog our ecosystems in very graphic ways but losing a valuable material like plastic after one use is also a huge  loss to the economy. Bringing it back into use is at the heart of the solution."" In practice, this means designing economically viable ways to significantly reduce land-based municipal waste and prevent used plastics from entering the ocean. Creating the right economic conditions will be key so that waste collection and aggregation contributes to local economic growth and job creation. The center aims to lay out its analysis in a way that stakeholders—plastic producers, consumer-goods companies, municipalities, or waste-picker communities—can use as an objective basis for discussion. Then comes the challenge of working with a community of interested parties to develop and implement a plan. ""The real art is contributing McKinsey analysis and problem solving while also tapping the expertise of other organizations,"" Martin explains.

Celebrating 20 years in South Africa,McKinsey Johannesburg celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2015 with a series of events that bring CEOs and government leaders together with our global leadership.,2015-03-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Offices,Africa",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/celebrating-20-years-in-south-africa,"Celebrating 20 years in South Africa McKinsey Johannesburg celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2015 with a series of events that bring CEOs and government leaders together with our global leadership. March 3, 2015 South Africa in 1995 was going through one of the most profound transitions of the century. President Nelson Mandela had been swept to power in an election that ended centuries of racial segregation. But his government had inherited a stagnant economy with high levels of unemployment and public debt. In business, South African companies finally had access to international markets after decades of isolation. Yet they also faced an influx of global competitors, making modernization essential. It was in this eventful context that McKinsey opened in Johannesburg—our first permanent presence in Africa—with a handful of consultants drawn from our European and North American offices. ""We were crammed into a single office—experienced partners and newly minted associates alike,"" says David Fine, the first South African to join the new operation. ""The sense of possibility was palpable. We were the only top management consulting firm in the country, and we went knocking on CEOs' doors. Before long, we were helping several of the largest companies rethink their strategies and reshape their operations."" This week our Johannesburg office marks its 20th anniversary with a series of events that bring CEOs and government leaders together with our firm's global leadership. There's a lot to celebrate. Our presence in South Africa has grown to around 200 consultants. After sustained effort to transform and localize the office, most consultants—of all tenures—are African. With six offices across Africa—Addis Ababa, Casablanca, Johannesburg, Lagos, Luanda, and Nairobi—McKinsey is helping to propel economic development across the continent. More important, though, are the achievements of our clients. ""Perhaps our biggest contribution has been to help leading South African companies become global champions,"" says Safroadu ""Saf"" Yeboah-Amankwah , leader of our Johannesburg office. He points to our work with one  publicly listed company in which a dollar invested at the start of the turnaround program was worth $500 8 years later. McKinsey consultants have also worked with government departments on everything from industrial policy to public finance, and helped to tackle urgent social issues such as strengthening public education systems and developing strategies to combat HIV/AIDS. More recently, McKinsey partnered with Malaysia's Prime Minister's Delivery Unit to help the South African government launch Operation Phakisa , a high-profile initiative to drive ""big fast results"" in areas such as job creation and primary healthcare. What do the next 20 years hold? Leadership development and capability-building will remain central to our work, as the country shapes a new generation of managers, professionals, and entrepreneurs from all hues of the ""rainbow nation."" The McKinsey Leadership Program trains young black South African professionals in our tools, methodologies, and working approach. Some participants in the 2-year program stay on at McKinsey as consultants, but most go on to key management roles in leading companies and public institutions. Advancing women's leadership is another priority. Lohini Moodley , one of several women partners in Johannesburg, is leading the next phase of our global Women Matter research across Africa. ""We want to inspire the next generation of women leaders with the stories of the pioneers,"" she says. ""We will draw on their experience to understand how they personally overcame cultural and other barriers, and identify ways to address those barriers more systematically."" Says Saf Yeboah-Amankwah: ""Our ambition in the years ahead is to help the next wave of South African companies win on the global stage, and to work with government to achieve excellence in public education and other national priorities. At the same time, we will build a cohort of world-class leaders whose careers are accelerated by their experience at McKinsey.""

Since 1959, the McKinsey Awards have recognized the Harvard Business Review articles most likely to have a major influence on managers around the world, based on the judgment of an independent panel of business leaders and academics. (McKinsey does not take part in the judging process.) Award winners have touched on every aspect of management. A few highlights: in 1974, Peter Drucker won for ""New Templates for Today's Organizations,"" which addressed a need for new organizational structures, but warned against excessive reorganizations as a panacea. In 1979, Rosabeth Moss Kanter's influential ""Power Failure in Management Circuits,"" presented ideas about how power is derived and wielded within organizations. In 1995, Joseph Bower and Clayton Christensen coined a term now firmly established in the business lexicon: ""disruptive technologies."" Other award winners have touched on more personal business concerns, such as John Gabarro and John Kotter's 1980 article, ""Managing Your Boss,"" or Clay Christensen's award-winning article, ""How Will You Measure Your Life?"" in 2010. This year's winner addresses some fundamental questions about capitalism, finance, and wealth creation—specifically, how and why companies use stock buyback programs to deploy surplus capital, as opposed to investing in their businesses. We asked him a few questions. Congratulations on winning the McKinsey Award. What reception has the article received, from business leaders and beyond? ""It's been hugely positive. It's been covered in the Financial Times , the New York Times , and other business journals. Harold Meyerson, a columnist for the Washington Post , says it "" decodes the Rosetta Stone of America's economic decline ."" Elizabeth Warren cited the paper at a hearing on inequality . People who manage money are also concerned about the practice, and I've been invited to talk to folks in the investment world, among other invitations I've received."" ""People have told me it's an eye-opener, people who didn't necessarily disagree, but who hadn't thought of it. That's what's valuable about the article."" ""One of the interesting things is, those that don't agree with me haven't taken it on. Maybe when the prize is announced, some of the people who violently disagree with me—and I know they're out there—will respond. I'd like them to respond."" Are there any business leaders now speaking out on this? ""I have not encountered one sitting top executive of a US industrial corporation who's publicly spoken out against stock buybacks. Either Harvard Business Review has published an article that is wrong—and you ' re giving a prize to an article that's wrong—or people in places in power recognize that there's a problem."" ""I advocate a regulatory fix to stop stock buybacks because business leaders won't regulate themselves. If they would regulate themselves, they wouldn't put themselves under pressure to cut wages or jobs. And that's also how you get effective regulation."" Is this a global issue? Do other countries strike a better balance between the interests of shareholders, executives and employees, in your view? ""It has a tendency to be a global issue. In Germany the board of directors of any company with more than 2,000 employees has to have one less than half of the seats filled by worker representatives and the rest by management representatives. It's a system called codetermination. At one of Sweden's leading global companies there are no stock options for executives. The company adopted stock-option programs in the late 1990s, early 2000s, but they quickly got rid of them."" What are you working on now? ""I'm working on what I call collective and cumulative careers. If we expect to stay in the labor force for 40 years with decent incomes and enough money accumulated to retire on, we're going to have to engage in career-long learning, even if we change companies. In the old economy, once you had a job with a major company, you had it for life. That's not coming back—the world's too competitive and globalized."" ""If people in their 40s or 50s lose their jobs for whatever reason, society still needs them, and it's not charity to figure out how to make use of their capabilities. Society needs to make use of the human capital that these people have accumulated, and these people need good jobs. We have to think about how to preserve and enhance human capital over lifelong careers now that the large corporations are not playing that role. My research shows that it's an economic and business issue."" ""Stock buybacks have business leaders thinking about what I call 'downsize-and-distribute,' or how to extract value from companies for themselves. We have to get everyone thinking about 'retain-and-reinvest,' or how to make use of productive capabilities to create value for companies and society as a whole.""

Photo © Raegan Hodge/CARE March 19, 2015 McKinsey Social Initiative (MSI) today announced that Helene D. Gayle will be its first CEO. Helene is currently finishing her nearly decade-long tenure as president and CEO of CARE USA and will join MSI, the independent not-for-profit organization founded by McKinsey, in July. MSI was founded to develop innovative approaches to global problems. Its unique model leverages relationships across the public and private sectors to create, test, and scale new ways to address the world’s most pressing issues. Generation , MSI’s first program, is a global youth-employment program that aims to connect 1 million young people with jobs over the next five years in India, Kenya, Mexico, Spain, and the United States. Helene brings a deep understanding of how business, government, and philanthropy can shape what’s possible when working on global challenges—thanks to more than 30 years of her work on global issues with CARE USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Helene’s career has spanned from the doctor’s office to the highest levels of international development. As a young pediatrician, she saw how her patients' well-being was linked to wider societal issues and opted to pursue public health. In 1984, she joined the CDC, where she pioneered the domestic and international work on HIV and eventually became the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention; she also achieved the rank of Rear Admiral and Assistant Surgeon General in the U.S. Public Health Service. As the director of the Gates Foundation’s HIV, TB, and Reproductive Health program, Helene continued her work on HIV, funding an HIV prevention and treatment program in Botswana that was the first to show that treatment could reach people even in resource-poor settings. President Obama tapped her to chair the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS in 2010. At CARE USA, Helene has worked with partners in the private sector, governments, and nongovernmental organizations to expand CARE's reach to more than 97 million people in 2014. She’s been recognized by Forbes , Foreign Policy , Newsweek , and other publications as a top thinker and leader. She received the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Humanitarian Award in 2012. In 2008, Helene told Newsweek : “You reach a point in life where you know you may have more years behind you than ahead of you. I want to know that I’m using each day in ways that are meaningful to me. I want to feel that each day is better than the day before and that I’m happy to be waking up and have the opportunity to do the things I do.” When she joins MSI later this year, Helene will focus on building the organization and supporting the growth of Generation. In a world where 300 million young people are unemployed or underemployed and 40 percent of employers say they struggle finding qualified entry-level candidates, the program aims to create a replicable, scalable training approach that demonstrates a return on investment to both employers and young people. The resulting program will be made available to anyone who wants to use it anywhere in the world—to ultimately reach tens of millions of young people. Generation is a natural outgrowth of McKinsey’s work in education and education to employment. Mona Mourshed , who leads our firm’s global Education Practice and spearheads Generation, says of Helene: “She brings a tremendous set of experiences across the public and social space, and so we thought that she would be an ideal founding CEO for MSI.” Generation will operate pilot programs in all five countries by the end of 2015. Pilots launched in the United States and Spain in October 2014. Both feature two- to three-month skills boot camps for young people, including help with supportive services, such as transportation and child care, and mentoring during the first three months of job placement—the make-or-break period in most jobs. In Spain, the first Generation students are learning digital professions, such as web development and digital marketing. In the United States, Generation students in Pittsburgh and Wilmington are training to be certified nursing assistants. While it is early days, the program has already had a big win: 100 percent of graduates in Pittsburgh passed the state certification exam, compared to the national average of 50 percent. In addition, MSI and Generation recently received a $3.2 million grant from Walmart to expand the US pilots into retail professions. In one young student’s words, the program has been “a wonderful stepping stone for a person like me who didn’t have any help. . .this is something to change my life.” Watch this space for more stories about Generation, and follow the initiative on Facebook and Twitter .

A report from the Long-Term Value Summit,"As part of our initiative to help shift capital markets to a more long-term focus, earlier this month we helped pull together a one-day summit in New York.

March 23, 2015 As part of our initiative to help shift capital markets to a more long-term focus, earlier this month we helped pull together a one-day summit in New York. The event drew 120 chairmen and chief executives, chief investment officers, and government leaders. I cochaired the summit alongside Mark Wiseman (president and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, one of the largest pension funds in the world) and Larry Fink (chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.) I'll say more about the event in a moment, but first, some background may be helpful. The road to the summit began six years ago, when I moved from Asia to London. I was amazed by the different pressures faced by CEOs in each region. To oversimplify, Western European and North American CEOs appeared to be much more pressured (and measured) by quarterly earnings-per-share performance, while their Asian counterparts appeared to be focused (and measured) more on the value and prosperity they generated over the course of a decade or more. There are clear exceptions in both regions, but the sentiment was clear. Concerned about the impact that excessive focus on quarterly earnings was having on trust in capitalism as a whole, I wrote "" Capitalism for the long term ,"" which was published in the March 2011 issue of the Harvard Business Review . Quite rightly, a number of CEOs (Mark Wiseman and Larry Fink among them) responded that while they agreed there was a problem, what was really needed was an effort to come up with possible solutions. We started working together on developing a rigorous research base, identifying changes we could encourage within our own organizations, and mobilizing a group of business leaders to join us. Our joint research made clear that companies and investors need to balance long-term goals with disciplined short-term action. For example, it took many successful multinational consumer-goods companies between 7 and 11 years to become profitable in China; and 70 to 90 percent of the net present value of the average public company sits in cash flows expected more than three years out. The problem is that our capital markets and corporate boardrooms are excessively focused on the short term—a fact confirmed by a McKinsey Quarterly survey of more than 1,000 CEOs and board members. We found that although here have been some unhelpful regulatory changes (for example, new solvency rules in the insurance sector), the underlying problem is a breakdown of the investment value chain. This value chain runs from savers to asset owners (such as pension and sovereign-wealth funds) to asset managers to corporate boards and finally, to management. While savers invest their capital for broadly long-term goals like retirement, most asset owners parcel this capital out to asset managers, who are usually incentivized on a short-term basis against a benchmark. These asset managers in turn put pressure on corporate boards and management to deliver over the next quarter. In January 2014, Mark and I published a second Harvard Business Review article, "" Focusing capital on the long term ,"" to share this perspective. But we knew that making change happen would require broad support for practical recommendations based on the real-world experience of corporate executives and investors. Working with a group of about 20 senior executives and investors, we started to develop the recommendations that you can now find summarized in our white papers Investing for the future: A long-term portfolio guide , Straight talk for the long term: How to improve the investor-corporate dialogue (available on the Focusing Capital on the Long Term website, fclt.org ), and in our most recent Harvard Business Review article together, "" Where boards fall short "" (January 2015). The Long-Term Value Summit was a chance to debate these ideas and encourage action among a wider set of business and government leaders. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew opened the session by calling for longer-term views and laying out a plan based on trade legislation, tax reform, infrastructure investment, and education. Larry Fink followed with a moderated discussion of his push to encourage boards and CEOs to be more oriented toward the long term. He argued that the media, in particular, play a very unhelpful role here. Next up was Nitin Nohria, dean of Harvard Business School, who led a “fire starting"" session with the whole room, probing what individual CEOs had done to balance short- and long-term pressures in their organizations or how they had kept their teams focused on a long-term ""North Star"" in the midst of short- and medium-term uncertainty. (For anyone who has sat through a Harvard Business School case, it was fun to see some of the world's most successful CEOs being cold called!) The participative approach continued with breakout groups building on the recommendations in our reports and fleshing out actions that attendees could take as investors or as companies. In the afternoon, prompted by the question, “What can we do together?"" we continued in breakout groups to determine how to improve the dialogue between investors and corporates, how to create a long-term ecosystem (inclusive of media, Wall Street, and regulators), and, last but not least, how to drive change. Perhaps most exciting was our final session: a discussion of the commitments to action that attendees were willing to make. These included a chief investment officer announcing that his funds would lengthen the time horizons over which asset managers were remunerated; another announcing that his organization would create a long-term value index to replace its existing benchmark; and a third announcing a change program to retrain fund managers. CEOs talked about ending quarterly reporting, publishing a suite of long-term performance and health metrics, and having more frank conversations with their boards. There was also enthusiasm to continue to work together in small groups of investors and companies to “fix"" the investment value chain. As for McKinsey, we have a role to play here as trusted advisers to organizations and senior leaders across the investment value chain. Whether advising companies on strategy and corporate finance, serving big investors and asset managers, or counseling new CEOs and change leaders, we will sharpen our focus on value creation over the long term. After all, our core mission has always been to help our clients improve their performance in an enduring and sustained manner.

April 6, 2015 If you want to understand how technology is driving innovation and reshaping industries, there's one place you have to visit: Silicon Valley. The 40-mile stretch of office parks and sun-drenched suburbia boasts the world's densest concentration of technology giants, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. ""We get eight to ten calls a month from executives around the world who want to experience the valley,"" says Eric Kutcher , who leads McKinsey's US West Coast region from our Palo Alto office. Our Silicon Valley Innovation Boot Camps are intensive 2- to 3-day sessions that bring these executives face-to-face with innovators who are at once potential business partners and potential formidable foes. Each boot camp typically comprises up to half a dozen executives and board members from a single client company. The McKinsey team puts together a custom itinerary of visits, workshops, and debriefs based on the client's industry and what they are trying to achieve. Michael Uhl, a Palo Alto-based McKinsey partner and boot-camp organizer, points to three key questions that are typically on the minds of participants: Putting together itineraries to address these questions—for clients across a wide range of different industries—requires a broad network of contacts. This is where the collective reach of McKinsey's Palo Alto and San Francisco  offices (60-plus partners and about 400 consultants are split roughly equally between the two locations) comes into play. Clients served from these locations include not only household names but also start-ups ranging from the scrappy to members of the ""billion-dollar club""—start-ups now valued at $1 billion or more. Combined with a community of McKinsey alumni spread widely across Silicon Valley, the network runs deep. Part of the magic is having a critical mass of decision-makers together for an extended period. ""When you put major players in an industry together with major players in Silicon Valley, the thinking evolves quickly on both sides,"" says Michael. Follow-up meetings can be arranged on the spot and pilot projects given a green light. Inspiration can come from unexpected places. Alex Kazaks, a San Francisco-based partner and boot-camp organizer, recalls a recent meeting between the top management team of a big financial-services client and the CEO of a start-up developing middleware for drones: ""Who even knew that drones needed middleware? But it was a great conversation and sparked some serious thinking about how drones could be used commercially in a totally new way."" ""Putting our network to work for clients is what makes the boot camps tick,"" says Eric. ""It shows that there are a lot of different ways that we can serve. Clients have described them as a perfect launchpad for their digital innovations and initiatives."" What does a typical day look like? Like all our client work, boot camps are confidential.

April 28, 2015 In 1973, Atari sold 2,500 units of its coin-operated arcade game Pong . Each unit cost $1,200. Last year, the video game industry topped $100 billion. For Jayson Chi, a McKinsey partner in Hong Kong, what started as small-time hobby has turned into a large-scale professional passion. The head of our burgeoning video games practice remembers playing Pong at the age of four and, when he was six, cajoling his parents into buying an early Nintendo console. Later he would sneak into arcades to play Street Fighter . As an only child growing up in Hong Kong, video games were a good way to make friends. He recalls: ""All my school friends wanted to come over because I had the coolest games."" A fascination with high tech and business led Jayson to Stanford University in California for a joint degree in engineering and management science. When he moved to Tokyo in 2003 to pursue an interest in Japanese media and culture, the gaming bug came back with a vengeance—including a marathon 60-hour session playing Dragon Quest VIII right after its release on PlayStation 2. When he joined McKinsey in 2006, Jayson was eager to serve gaming companies but dismayed to find that the firm had few active clients in the sector. So he took a bold step: writing a turnaround plan for a troubled video game company and delivering it, unprompted, to the company's turnaround officer. It was well received. Introductions and inquiries from other gaming companies soon followed. Fluent in Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, business- and gamer-speak, Jayson was well equipped to help. Many of these early clients operated at the intersection of social media and mobile gaming, a model that served as a blueprint for the free-to-play games now ubiquitous on smartphones the world over. The boom in gaming has not slowed. Today, Jayson and colleagues serve a wide variety of gaming-industry clients, as well as non-gaming companies intrigued by the industry's innovation and growth. Their work for clients ranges from strategy and consumer insights to advanced analytics. ""I am so fortunate to have such a breadth of insight across gaming; I don't think there's a more interesting job.""

May 8, 2015 The appearance of a poster in an office dining hall in Poznan, Poland, might not seem like the bellwether of progress. But for Lukasz Kozanowski and Maciej Moder, team assistants at our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) service center, the posters represented a monumental step in their personal and professional lives: they were publicly coming out and starting the office's first chapter of Equal at McKinsey , McKinsey's affinity group for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) people. The posters Lukasz and Maciej hung in their office cafeterias in January 2013 invited colleagues to the kickoff event. ""We were nervous because we basically came out to the whole company with the posters,"" said Maciej. ""We weren't sure how we would be received,"" said Lukasz. ""But given the office demographics, we were hopeful."" Taking such a step required courage. ""We sometimes struggle with attitudes toward gay people in our lives outside of McKinsey. We see outdated views on television, on the Internet, and even on the streets,"" Lukasz said. Maciej noticed an immediate change at the office after the first Equal at McKinsey event. ""It's really good when you feel safe and you can be whoever you want to be and know that people will support you."" The start of a new chapter in Poland exemplifies the empowering, grassroots nature of Equal at McKinsey, which is celebrating an important anniversary: the organization turns 20 in May. Its network of GLBT members and allies around McKinsey spans the globe. As of May 2015, there are more than 350 Equal at McKinsey members worldwide, a membership that nearly doubled over the past two years. There are also over 1,000 Equal at McKinsey Allies, straight firm members committed to supporting their GLBT peers, in 20 offices around the world. These numbers are growing every day. Founded in 1995 by John DeVicentis and 13 others (including Brian Rolfes, the last remaining founder in the firm, who is now our partner leading Global Recruiting), Equal at McKinsey began as a response to requests from GLBT recruits to speak with ""out"" firm members. ""It all started with one candidate who asked the right question at the right time,"" Brian remembers. It was quickly understood that for the firm to continually attract top talent, targeted GLBT outreach was critical. Dennis Layton, a principal based in London, remembers attending one of the earliest Equal at McKinsey recruiting dinners: ""It definitely made me feel like I landed in the right spot."" Dennis was recently named one of the top GLBT businesspeople in the United Kingdom by the Financial Times. Equal at McKinsey quickly influenced firm policy as well. In 1997, McKinsey became the first consulting firm to extend medical and other benefits to same-sex couples in North America—and by 2007 we recognized same-sex relationships around the world. More recently, the firm introduced a tax-equalization policy, the first company at the time to do so on a global scale. As of 2014, McKinsey instituted broad transgender health benefits, ensuring any and all medically necessary health care. Thanks to these policies, Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index has awarded a perfect 100 score to McKinsey since 2006. Beyond shaping firm policies, Equal at McKinsey has also created a strong network that offers personal support. Its unique membership structure continues to allow for those considering coming out to have the privacy and care they need as they make that decision. Its global conferences, convened every 18 months, strengthen a growing global community. And local chapters' events and programs offer members meaningful mentoring, recruiting, and professional-development opportunities. ""I think that Equal at McKinsey has an incredible impact on people by helping them be authentic at work,"" said senior manager for Diversity Lori Dobeus. ""The fact that we're a strong, global community, where members can reach out to each other for support, creates unsung moments of accomplishment all the time."" Equal at McKinsey has also had an impact outside of McKinsey. Equal at McKinsey members have undertaken major pro-bono work for the Trevor Project , the Point Foundation , and GLAAD . McKinsey, along with other companies, recently signed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court in support of marriage equality. And Equal at McKinsey has convened a wider network of GLBT executives for leadership seminars in New York, London, and Amsterdam. The network is a step toward addressing one of the questions Equal at McKinsey hopes to answer in the coming years, according to Brian Rolfes: ""How can we bring together the GLBT leaders across different sectors so that they can grow in their leadership potential, as well as support them to continue making progress?"" At its core, Equal at McKinsey's story, much like that of Lukasz and Maciej, shows the power of motivated McKinsey members who want to change the firm and its culture for the better.

May 19, 2015 This month marks the publication of No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All The Trends (PublicAffairs, May 2015), a book by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) directors Richard Dobbs, James Manyika , and Jonathan Woetzel . As the title suggests, the book surveys powerful forces that are transforming the global economy, and argues that we all need to reset the intuitions and assumptions that drive our decision-making on everything from corporate strategy to personal investment. Take a 5-minute quiz to test your intuition about our rapidly changing world Publication coincides with the 25 th anniversary of MGI and brings together many of the big ideas that our in-house think tank has developed and refined over the past quarter century. Inspiration for the book came at a resort on the Malaysian island of Langkawi, recalls Richard. The Malaysian prime minister and the board members of Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the nation's strategic investment fund, were holding a management retreat. McKinsey was invited to outline trends that would shape the world over the next 50 years, over breakfast in an open-air restaurant surrounded by an ancient rainforest. This was strictly a no-PowerPoint affair, says Richard, ""so I needed colorful examples to compete with the monkeys swinging through the trees."" Elsewhere, CEOs had been asking for an overview of MGI's perspective to complement its steady flow of research on topics ranging from globalization to disruptive technologies to obesity. So the project was born—a collective effort to show how the world is changing by combining fact-based analysis with eye-opening examples. As the manuscript took shape it became clear that there was potential for a book-length treatment. PublicAffairs, an imprint of Perseus Books Group, signed up as publisher. The diverse backgrounds of the three authors contributes to the breadth of the story they tell. Jonathan, an American with a PhD in political science, has lived in China for more than 25 years. When not serving clients or engaged in MGI research he is co-chair of the not-for-profit Urban China Initiative—a joint venture led by Columbia University, Tsinghua University, and McKinsey. James, born and raised in Zimbabwe, a former member of the engineering faculty at Oxford University, and long-time resident of San Francisco, has a unique perspective on technology, growth, and globalization. Richard, now back into London after a six-year stint in Korea, is a former leader of our Corporate Finance Practice. The book focuses on four major disruptions: the industrialization and urbanization of emerging economies; the accelerating pace of technological change; the demography of aging populations and declining fertility rates; and increasing global interconnectivity. Each of these trends is larger than any disruption the global economy has ever experienced. Yet all four are hitting at the same time—creating second-, third-, and even fourth-order effects that are scarcely possible to anticipate. What will it take to succeed in this unpredictable new world? The book ends on a positive note. The first imperative for executives and leaders across all sectors (private, public, and not-for-profit) is to maintain an external orientation—that is, don't become so wrapped up with internal challenges that you lose sight of how the world is changing. A second is to be prepared to rethink your assumptions and stay agile, because change will play out in ways that are scarcely predictable. The third is to be optimistic—with three billion people set to join the the global middle class, and technological progress happening at breathtaking speed, there are huge opportunities for individuals and organizations. ""We believe that optimism will still win the day, even in the trend-break era,"" the authors write.

From paper to pixels,The McKinsey Insights app continues our long publishing tradition.,2015-06-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our Publishing,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/from-paper-to-pixels,"From paper to pixels Not-so-distant ancestor: An early issue of McKinsey Quarterly next to the McKinsey Insights app June 10, 2015 Sometimes, the simple ideas are the most revolutionary. Way back when, in 1961, a senior partner named Arch Patton proposed that McKinsey should publish a quarterly journal as a vehicle for its best thinking. Some colleagues worried that self-publishing would be perceived as self-promotional or even (the worst sin of all) commercial. It took Patton three years to convince his fellow partners. When it finally launched, the McKinsey Quarterly turned out to be highly effective. The firm already had a strong publishing tradition. James O. McKinsey , our founder, wrote some of the first books on budgeting and management accounting, and Arch Patton was a fecund writer of articles and books on executive compensation. The discipline of producing a regular journal spurred many more McKinsey consultants to research and write. It also necessitated the hiring of professional editors, which helped set new standards of consistency and clarity. Roll forward half a century and the Quarterly is still going strong. Yet the world—and McKinsey—have changed in ways that Arch Patton's generation could never have anticipated. First, our firm has grown from about 40 partners in the mid-1960s to more than 1,400 today. As a result, McKinsey produces more articles and reports (not to mention blog posts, videos, and infographics) than could ever fit between the covers of a quarterly journal. Second, publishing increasingly is a digital, mobile enterprise. Just like everyone else, McKinsey clients are more likely to be found reading (and sharing) content on their smartphones than handing xerographed pages around their offices. The McKinsey Insights app is our answer to the new needs of our readers: mobile, convenient, customizable, and compendious. It serves up not only McKinsey Quarterly articles but also research reports from McKinsey Global Institute , our in-house economics think tank, and a wide range of materials produced by our practices. What's more, it is available to all-comers for Android devices, iPad and now for iPhone . A few facts about the McKinsey Insights app: What comes next for our publishing program? Beyond creating a more mobile-friendly version of mckinsey.com (watch this space) it's fair to say we don't know for sure. But if McKinsey clients start consuming management insights via virtual reality goggles, we'll be there before you can say immersive multimedia.

Giving companies a second chance,Our turnaround experts bring specialist skills and operating experience to companies in distress.,2015-06-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Recovery and Transformation Services,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/giving-companies-a-second-chance,"Giving companies a second chance June 19, 2015 ""My wife is a doctor. She fixes people. I think of myself as helping to fix organizations,"" says Richard Hudson, a London-based McKinsey partner and one of our growing team of corporate-recovery experts. ""Often I'm the last stop before a business fails, and I help it get back on its feet."" Our RTS group was created five years ago to address the unique business, financial, and legal needs of companies in distress. While helping clients turn around businesses has always been a part of McKinsey's work, recovery situations sometimes require specialist skills and capabilities. These might include a nuanced understanding of local insolvency laws and/or the ability to step into an interim management role—becoming a company officer, as opposed to a consultant/adviser. Since RTS was founded, our restructuring experts—partnering with industry and functional experts from across McKinsey—have served clients in 20-plus countries on five continents. ""Restructuring is all-consuming work,"" explains Greg Fern, who held senior operating roles at Motorola Mobility and Sears Holdings before joining McKinsey RTS. ""You have to thrive on change and enjoy teaching people to do things differently. We become personal trainers at all levels of an organization, from the CEO to the front line."" First impressions are critical to gaining credibility, especially when the stakes are very high. ""The magic of this work is you have to go in quietly and prove your value quickly—and then inspire people to change,"" says Richard, whose restructuring experience spans industries as diverse as helicopters and telecoms and countries from Ireland to Greece. RTS specialists help leaders, managers, and employees design and implement new processes, identify and track key indicators, model new behaviors, and motivate people to change. ""One of the cornerstones of effective restructuring is accountability or the 'say-do ratio,'"" says Greg. Weekly meetings with company managers track progress across a raft of operational, financial, and strategic initiatives. It quickly becomes apparent if individuals or departments are not living up to their commitments. Every turnaround has its own psychology and cadence. First comes a ""down into the valley"" phase as managers and employees acknowledge the critical nature of the situation. Then they work together to come up with a plan—""the hope agenda."" In the execution phase, the emphasis is on painting a picture of a better future and recognizing tangible milestones along the way. Then comes the point at which people start to believe. ""You can literally feel the tide turning,"" says Richard. Unfortunately, most restructurings do involve job losses. What is the best way to deliver bad news? ""I think you need a strong fact base&mdmdash;emphasizing that it is an objective decision, not a personal decision. Listen to the other person. Counsel them on what they will do next,"" advises Richard. But while restructuring may require layoffs, the long-term result may be saving jobs—or even creating new ones as a business moves in a new direction. ""I spent nine months helping restructure a mining company that employed 80 percent of a small town,"" Greg recalls. ""The company had job reductions early on...but as we reorganized the procurement group, focused on factors related directly to the bottom line, and tightened up management...people recognized what we were doing would help the company and, thus, the community overall.""

Dominic Barton&rsquo;s summer reading list,"Clients and colleagues have given me many great suggestions of books to read, podcasts to listen to, and summer events to go to&mdash;many more than I suspect I will be able to get through.",2015-07-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Global Managing Partner,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/dominic-barton-summer-reading-list,"Dominic Barton’s summer reading list July 1, 2015 by Dominic Barton —The dog days are upon us in the northern hemisphere, as the United States celebrates the Fourth of July and we welcome a new intake of summer associates and business analysts to many of our offices. In addition to enjoying some downtime with family and friends, I hope to use some of my vacation to make a dent in my ever-growing reading list. Clients and colleagues have given me many great suggestions of books to read, podcasts to listen to, and summer events to go to—many more than I suspect I will be able to get through. The list below is not exhaustive, but it includes recommendations that have come up a few times or with very high praise and are at the top of my reading list this summer. Non-fiction The Road to Character (Random House, April 2015) by David Brooks Separating “résumé virtues” (our external successes) from “eulogy virtues” (our character and relationships), Brooks challenges us to invest more in the personal qualities that truly define us and less in our short-term advancement. Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 2015) by Evan Osnos From his vantage point as long-time Beijing correspondent for the New Yorker, Osnos provides incisive commentary on life in China through detailed portraits of well-known leaders, media figures, and dissidents, as well as everyday people. Dividing his book into three sections, Osnos focuses on modern China's search for wealth, freedom, and meaning. The Wright Brothers (Simon & Schuster, May 2015) by David McCullough This Pulitzer Prize-winning author draws on an extensive collection of private diaries and letters to tell the human side of Wilbur and Orville Wright's story, beginning with their childhood in a Dayton, Ohio home with no plumbing or electricity. Rejecting recent historians' depictions of the brothers as fortunate tinkerers, McCullough argues that it was the Wrights' courage, dedication, and ingenuity that helped them succeed. McCullough also explores the contributions of their sister Katharine Wright, overlooked by earlier historians. The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age (Harvard Business Review Press, 2014) by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, and Chris Yeh The authors argue that in the networked age, managers and employees must see one another as neither family nor free agents but allies, with different but complementary goals. They offer recommendations for how both sides can get the most out of the relationship, including investing in one another's success and recognizing that talented employees may leave for other opportunities—and that this is no great insult. Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money (Harper, May 2015) by Nathaniel Popper Popper, a New York Times technology and business writer, tells the story of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency produced via mathematical formula with no central-bank oversight. Digital Gold describes how Bitcoin grew from a radical new idea on the outskirts of the web to a technology with a market capitalization of more than $3 billion. Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future (Ecco, May 2015) by Ashlee Vance The first journalist to obtain exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, Vance provides an inside view of Musk's journey. He argues that Musk's incredible work ethic and deep desire to see his ideas proven right, partially influenced by his challenging upbringing in South Africa, have driven him to relentlessly pursue game-changing ideas. Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End (Metropolitan Books, 2014) by Atul Gawande Gawande, a surgeon and best-selling author, argues that end-of-life goals for patients and families are dignity and quality of life—and that much of current care runs counter to these goals. He explores different models of hospice care, ones that are more likely to offer comfort and meaning. Humans Are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That Brilliant Machines Never Will (Portfolio, August 2015) by Geoff Colvin Colvin responds to growing concern about a “jobless future,” in which working people are replaced by machines, by arguing that technology is giving rise to a new economy where uniquely human skills—creativity, empathy, an ability to build relationships—are the most highly prized. Thirteen Days in September: the Dramatic Story of the Struggle for Peace (Vintage, April 2015) by Lawrence Wright Wright combines political analysis with research into the personal histories of Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin of Israel, and Anwar Sadat of Egypt to tell the story of the 1978 Camp David Accords, which laid the foundation for the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. Fiction The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Vintage, April 2015) by Richard Flanagan Centering his story around the building of the “Death Railway” from Thailand to Burma by captured Allied soldiers in World War II, Flanagan explores the depth of our capacity for both cruelty and compassion. Go Set a Watchman (Harper, July 2015) by Harper Lee Believed to have been lost, this book is Harper Lee's earliest known work, submitted to publishers before To Kill a Mockingbird . Rediscovered and published, it explores the events transforming 1950s America and their effects on life in Maycomb, Alabama. All the Light We Cannot See (Scribner, 2014) by Anthony Doerr A finalist for the National Book Award, this moving story depicts a German boy and a blind French girl whose lives become intertwined in World War II. McKinsey colleagues have published a number of excellent books and reports this year. Three I want to highlight in particular are: No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All the Trends (PublicAffairs, May 2015) by Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, and Jonathan Woetzel; Beyond Cybersecurity: Protecting Your Digital Business (Wiley, April 2015)  by James Kaplan, Tucker Bailey, Derek O'Halloran, Alan Marcus, and Chris Rezek; Brighter Africa: The growth potential of the sub-Saharan electricity sector by Antonio Castellano, Adam Kendall, Mikhail Nikomarov, and Tarryn Swemmer. Finally, I am modernising the summer reading list this year to include a podcast series: Invisibilia by Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller. In six one-hour-long podcasts, Invisibilia explores the invisible forces shaping our world, from the mechanical (e.g., digitisation, our ability to see) to the philosophical (e.g., where our thoughts come from.)

Announcing the Organizational Science Initiative,"Backed by McKinsey and Gallup, the initiative will create new approaches for using data to improve the performance of organizations.",2015-07-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Organization,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/announcing-the-organizational-science-initiative,"Announcing the Organizational Science Initiative July 15, 2015 The winds of change are blowing through organization, the branch of management concerned with the human side of the enterprise—topics such as employee engagement, change, culture, and leadership. While quantification and measurement have always been part of the toolkit, there is a growing imperative to collect and analyze hard data about what are sometimes seen as 'soft' management issues. Such is the context for our new collaboration with Gallup, the analytics and advice firm that has 80 years of experience measuring engagement, talent, and management. The Organizational Science Initiative, backed by McKinsey and Gallup, is a joint effort to develop next-generation org analytics. By pooling resources and working with leading thinkers in the field, the aim is to kindle new approaches and common data standards. The standards part is vital to enabling what data wonks call ""cross platform analysis"" across companies, industries, and regions. Organizational health is a key concept in all of this, says Chris Gagnon , leader of our organization analytics group at McKinsey. Says Chris: ""The problem is that no single firm has the ability to take all this data and translate it into a complete picture of organizational health. Combining the data and knowledge is going to mean we can look at org health in ways that haven't been possible before. (For more on the link between performance and health read The hidden value of organizational health—and how to capture it . ) Exactly how this will pan out is still being worked through. However, one of things that Gallup brings to the table is a trove of data from its Q12 employee engagement survey , which has been administered by hundreds of organizations since the late 1990s. From the McKinsey side comes data from the Organizational Health Index , a tool for measuring an organization's capacity to perform that's been used with about 900 clients globally. ""We think there's a lot to be gained by integrating our strength in organizational strategy and health with Gallup's deep insight into the attitudes and behaviors of individual employees,"" says Bill Schaninger, a McKinsey partner with a PhD in organizational psychology who leads advanced analytics for our global Organization Practice. In the meantime, the joint Gallup-McKinsey team is busy creating a global advisory board for the new initiative, comprised principally of chief human resource officers from large organizations. There are also plans for a series of regional summits to bring advisory board members together with other executives and experts. The goal is to keep the Organizational Science Initiative grounded in the business priorities of practicing managers while also shaping a long-term research agenda for the field. There's nothing soft about it.

"Made in Brazil: Smarter, leaner businesses","Our new model factory is a training ground for lean manufacturing, improving productivity in Latin America.",2015-07-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Capability Building,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/made-in-brazil-smarter-leaner-businesses,"Made in Brazil: Smarter, leaner businesses July 24, 2015 What can manufacturing steel cylinders teach you about making granola? Quite a bit, it turns out. Employees of a natural foods company in Salvador, Brazil recently completed a month-long transformation program at our newest model factory, Fabrica Modelo Brasil (FMB). This hands-on learning environment teaches the principles of lean manufacturing . Through a series of live scenarios and interactive exercises, the food company employees developed skills such as mapping a work stream, balancing a line, identifying waste, measuring cycle times, and creating relevant performance metrics. On returning to their own workplace—an industrial bakery—they began to apply these concepts, looking for ways to improve productivity. ""The process changes we made included prepping ingredients, such as grating the coconut the day before; reordering the steps in the recipe; standardizing measurements; and using lighter, less-expensive packaging,"" explains Bruna del Negro, the McKinsey consultant who worked on-site with the group. The employees doubled their production capacity without adding staff. ""Low productivity is the single biggest hindrance to growth in Latin America,"" says Björn Hagemann, the McKinsey partner who leads the program. This is especially true in the northeastern region of Brazil, which is underprivileged and developing very quickly. As companies come in to set up their first factory or facility in the region, they are often hiring people with limited or no experience. ""Field workers can become industrial employees overnight,"" according to Björn, ""and there is a tremendous need for skills."" To build FMB, our first model factory in Latin America, we partnered with SENAI, a major not-for-profit institution that provides formalized industrial training throughout the country. SENAI built the factory on the grounds of its Salvador campus and is focused on programs for micro, small, and medium-size businesses, the engine behind much of Brazil's potential growth. Our team supported the factory design, development of the lean curriculum, and staff training. The facility allows us to deliver customized training to clients—which are typically large organizations ranging from manufacturers to banks, retailers, government agencies, and more—embarking on major transformation programs. Objectives can range from improving the performance of supplier networks, streamlining core processes, or enhancing the skills of frontline employees. ""It makes a tremendous difference for our clients to be taught by our local experts who understand the idiosyncrasies of Latin American business—and they can do hands-on work in an actual model factory,"" says Björn. McKinsey then reinforces these newly learned skills with coaching, role modeling, and performance metrics to develop and ingrain new mind-sets and behaviors. A second pilot program included a professional uniform manufacturer. After spending time at the model factory, employees produced a 30 percent increase in output with no additional resources by realigning the sewing cells on the factory floor and redistributing the work flow per person. ""We want to offer our clients here in Salvador and the rest of northeast Brazil access to the same skills and ways of thinking that we provide to our clients in other parts of the world,"" says Vijay Gosula , the McKinsey director who founded the Salvador office three years ago. With a focus on hiring and growing local talent, the office is close-knit, young, and enthusiastic—some 15 business analysts are helping build our presence here, serving clients in the retail, consumer goods, infrastructure, and public sectors. ""I am from Salvador,"" says Victor Pinto, a local business analyst, ""and proud to be involved in some of the projects that are changing the city for the better.""

Food for thought,"The critical demand for food is creating opportunities for agricultural investment worldwide, and a keen appetite to improve productivity.",2015-08-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Agriculture,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/food-for-thought,"Food for thought Viroopa Volla, a business analyst based in our San Francisco office, stands in front of 30,000-pound silos used for blending fertilizer in Denver, Colorado. August 10, 2015 There are close to 100 McKinsey consultants who could be described as being obsessed with food. As members of our Agriculture Practice , they spend their time thinking about ways to make food taste better, cost less, last longer, and be healthier. They research and identify opportunities for investment, including the 20-plus global agriculture hot spots outlined in our latest report . They help feed the ever increasing global population by advising farmers, food processors, and others on how to make land more productive and food more available. Among their numbers are meteorologists, chemists, veterinarians, financial analysts, data geeks—and even foodies. Ludovic Meilhac Ludovic knows a lot about boysenberries. And cashews. And corn. But his real expertise is milk, knowledge developed during 13 years at Danone in France and North America—first on the manufacturing side, and then in sourcing. Today he works with our clients on sourcing ingredients and managing their food operations and supply chains. ""Milk looks simple. It's liquid. It's white. You can distill it into many products,"" he says. ""But you have no control over the cows—so you are managing an unpredictable supply with fluctuating demand for an ever increasing number of dairy products. This perpetual imbalance makes it always interesting."" Adding to the pressure is time: raw milk has a storage life of 24 to 48 hours, or it has to be thrown out. Processing milk used to be a straightforward choice—regular or skim? Today, there are some 100-plus variations, with different levels of fat, calcium, protein, preservatives, flavors, and more. Dairy producers need to make increasingly complex decisions in shorter and shorter time frames. ""We do not have a crystal ball, but what we can do is help our clients instill greater flexibility into their recipes, supply chains, and other systems,"" says Ludovic, ""so they can plan for and react faster to external forces such as fluctuating consumer preferences, weather changes, volatile commodity markets, and pricing pressures. They have more options."" Ludovic has also organized a network of resources that spans our Agriculture, Operations, Retail, and Consumer Practices. We can quickly mobilize, providing experts, knowledge, tools and resources to help clients improve their food operations. Lutz Goedde Born and raised in Germany, Lutz grew up working on dairy farms, milking cows, and riding horses—while playing professional volleyball on the side—and pursued advanced degrees in agricultural economics. Early internships in Africa and Central America laid the foundation for his later work in development. ""In 1990, I did field trials inspecting crops in South Africa. The country was on the cusp of democracy—apartheid had been abolished, everyone was consumed with politics,"" he remembers, ""and agriculture was critical to the future."" Several years later, he did a stint in Costa Rica managing commodity accounts in bananas, coffee, and sugar. He traveled through the subsistence farms where families were living in poverty. ""Both experiences made a profound impression on me."" With a new MBA in hand, Lutz worked with McKinsey's agribusiness clients for 4 years before taking a ""crazy offer"" to turn around a cattle-genetics company. When it returned to financial health several years later, he headed for the hills, climbing and skiing mountains in the Canadian Rockies. A call came out of the blue from Sunil Sanghvi , who leads McKinsey's Agriculture Practice, inviting him to a meeting with a leading foundation. That 3-hour brainstorming session led to a number of projects over the next 5 years, where Lutz initially led the team helping the organization formulate its agricultural-development program and later joined the foundation's leadership team in global development. Today, the foundation invests more than $1 billion annually in development initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Lutz serves a number of core clients in North America and Asia, including agricultural-input businesses such as seed, irrigation, and fertilizer companies. He helps investors identify opportunities for growth, as outlined in our newest report, pointing out that agriculture has outperformed most sectors since 2006. He sees the biggest global challenge of today as one of ensuring that the food supply keeps pace with demand. If current trends continue, by 2050, the demand for calories worldwide will rise by 70 percent. Demand for crops for human and livestock consumption will jump by 100 percent. How can we feed the nine billion people who will be living on our planet? Food security—ensuring that all people have access to nutritious, safe food—is an issue that all sectors of the food and agriculture industries are facing. Two possible solutions, says Lutz, are increasing output through technology and innovation and selectively bringing more land into production, for example, in Africa. David Fiocco One way to increase agricultural productivity is through data. Traditionally, much of the decision making in farming has been done by intuition and gut instinct. David wants to change that by applying data and analytics to agriculture, 25 kilometers of land at a time. David is an agricultural-development expert and a former Fulbright Scholar who studied postconflict agricultural networks in Sierra Leone. More recently, he leads the development of a new McKinsey software solution dubbed ACRE—or Agriculture Commodity Research Engine. It applies agronomic data to land maps anywhere in the world so that users can make smarter decisions about planting crops at a very local level. Government agencies can use ACRE to decide which crop initiatives to invest in. Food companies can use it to source raw ingredients more effectively. ""Mapping software revolutionized the way we travel and use location data,"" David said, ""and ACRE is changing the way we use data to improve agricultural output."" The bottom line is the urgent need to improve agricultural productivity. ""If we can apply the full potential of our resources to agriculture, we can more effectively feed millions of hungry kids and adults,"" says Lutz. ""It doesn't get any more basic than that.""

August 18, 2015 When more than 75 million young adults are out of work globally and three times as many are underemployed, it can feel like a triumph every time a young person is hired into a skilled job. Generation , a program spearheaded by the McKinsey Social Initiative , is addressing youth employment one small triumph at a time by helping young people build the skills they need to land good jobs in their local economies. Generation began with pilots in Spain and the United States and now has additional programs up and running in India, Kenya, and Mexico. The focus of each program depends on the local job market—the skills that employers need— but the learning is always intense. Generation courses are short, focused, and practical and free for participants. So far, Generation graduates are achieving encouraging results. In Spain, where the focus is on digital skills, 90 percent of the first cohort continues to be employed 6 months (and counting) after graduation. In the United States, where the focus is on healthcare, 93 percent of all graduates from the Generation program went on to pass the exam to become certified nursing assistants (CNAs), far surpassing the 50 percent national average pass rate. Within a month of passing the exam, 85 percent were placed into quality healthcare jobs. We checked in with two graduates of Generation, in the United States and Spain. Carly studied to become a CNA at Generation Pittsburgh and graduated this spring. In Madrid, Enrique studied digital marketing. Carly Carly, 20, grew up in Pittsburgh, a once-booming industrial city in America's rust belt. Still transitioning away from a manufacturing economy to other sectors, Pittsburgh is a challenging place for a young person to find a job, let alone start a career. Add to this the personal challenges that Carly had to face as a young mother at 19, armed with a high school degree, and little professional experience. Carly and Tamika met during their program at Generation #Pittsburgh, where they trained to become certified #nurse assistants. More @youemployed A post shared by McKinsey & Company (@mckinseyco) on Aug 11, 2015 at 11:22am PDT After 2 years of working in the laundry of a nursing home, Carly heard about Generation's training program to become a CNA. An emerging interest in working with the elderly and a growing daughter at home motivated her to action. ""I'll tell Delilah it's where we started. It's where Mommy started getting everything together for us,"" Carly says. During the program, Carly developed a close-knit group of friends who carried each other through to graduation and beyond. ""Generation played a big role in my evolution as an adult. They taught us how to be an adult in the real world, and that it's not always easy, but there are ways to do it."" Now employed as a CNA in the same nursing home where she worked in the laundry, Carly plans to continue studying to become a registered nurse. Her parents, she thinks, ""are really shocked and proud that I made it this far. But they need to know that I'm not just stopping here. I am just excited to see what the world is going to give me. Bring it on, world."" Enrique Enrique, 25, studied business administration and management at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. But, like nearly 50 percent of young people his age in Spain, he struggled to find a job. Any job. ""I felt powerless. I was even looking for work abroad, but I have lots of bonds here,"" he said. Enrique, like many young people in #Spain, struggled to find a good #job. Then, he signed up for Generation Spain's intensive #digital #marketing course. Learn more by following @youemployed A post shared by McKinsey & Company (@mckinseyco) on Aug 19, 2015 at 11:21am PDT He learned about Generation Spain while surfing the Internet. ""I applied after feeling frustrated, after thinking that I wasn't good, or that nobody cared about me."" After the Generation course in digital marketing, Enrique felt like he could finally fill the gaps between what he learned at university and the demands of the workplace. ""When I was in university, they told us to work in teams, but nobody taught me how to do it. At Generation, we learn to work in teams. We've also gotten better at dealing with people, at speaking, at giving feedback. It's the first training I've ever received on how to do that."" After graduating, Enrique found a job at iDoctus, a start-up that digitizes medical files. With only twelve employees in the company, he reports directly to the CEO. Thanks to his newly acquired skills, he monitors the analytics for marketing and use of the company's app. ""For me, and I don't mean to exaggerate, but it's like I discovered a new planet. I now have a new world to explore. If not for Generation, it would have been much harder to find this kind of job."" Next up for Generation More Generation graduates will be joining Carly and Enrique in the working world. A new class just graduated from a pilot to train CNAs in Wilmington, Delaware, and San Jose has a pilot in place as well. San Jose is slated to have its own CNA training pilot this year. Generation Kenya began in May and has already achieved inspiring results: a 98 percent job-placement rate for its first cohort, in financial services sales jobs that typically only go to university graduates. Generation India, where young people train for entry-level jobs in healthcare, also opened its doors this summer. Generation Mexico will place graduates in jobs in the retail sector and is accepting applications for its first cohort. Generation will continue scaling to new sites and professions. Moreover, it's committed to measuring its return on investment both for its graduates and the employers who hire them. They've planned a 15-year longitudinal study to understand just how lives and businesses have changed as a result of participating in Generation.

Our surprise best seller,Read the story behind Valuation.,2015-09-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our Publishing,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-surprise-best-seller,"Our surprise best seller September 4, 2015 Back in the late 1980s, when Tim Koller and his coauthors were looking for publishers interested in a book about business-value creation, they were politely informed that such a book, if successful, would sell perhaps 10,000 copies. Twenty-five years later, Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies has not only sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 languages but has also earned a regular spot on business-school curricula and executive bookshelves. What accounts for Valuation 's popularity and longevity? The book, whose sixth edition came out in August, not only explains in simple language how companies create value for shareholders but also links those principles to strategy creation, portfolio management, and capital structure. Less a textbook than a handbook, it uses real-world examples to show how growth and return on capital drive cash flows, which in turn drive value creation. This practical approach reflects the origins of Valuation as a handbook for McKinsey consultants. When Tim joined the firm in 1987, McKinsey was deepening its corporate finance capabilities to help clients navigate an era of swashbuckling corporate raiders and hostile takeovers. Tim and colleagues produced a guide to advanced valuation techniques contained in a three-ring binder. This became the foundation for the first edition of the book. Of the three McKinsey authors on the cover of the first edition, only Tim (now a leader in our Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice ) remains for the sixth. His coauthors this time around are Marc Goedhardt , a senior expert based in our Amsterdam office; and David Wessels , a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Over the years, Tim has seen a number of shifts in the way managers think about value. Historically, managers tended to focus on earnings growth, but return on capital has gradually become just as important for many companies. ""That's important because value creation is really about getting the balance right between growth and return on capital,"" Tim says. ""Earnings growth without return on capital does not create value."" The sixth edition arrives at a time of growing concern about corporate short-termism: the all-too-prevalent focus on chasing quarterly earnings growth, even if that puts long-term value at risk. ""When I talk to investors, it's clear short-term profits are not what they care about,"" says Tim. ""But while companies will say, 'We are long-term focused,' when you look at their decisions, that doesn't always seem the case."" The new edition of Valuation makes a strong case that companies with long-term horizons create more value and outperform competitors. During client meetings and presentations, Tim often encounters CEOs and CFOs who tell him they read Valuation early in their careers and it changed the way they think about business. He knows that, amidst intense performance pressures and high executive turnover, it takes a lot of courage to do what's needed to build lasting value for the company. His advice: ""When executives think about shareholder value creation, nothing says it has to be about today's shareholders. If they think about the collective benefit for today's and future shareholders, they might make different decisions.""

Our newest location: Vancouver,"Vancouver marks our 107th office worldwide. Other recent office openings include Almaty and Denver. Vancouver is the fourth office of ours to open in Canada and will serve British Columbia where a variety of industries are poised to grow.

Vancouver marks our 107th office worldwide. Other recent office openings include Almaty and Denver. Vancouver is the fourth office of ours to open in Canada and will serve British Columbia where a variety of industries are poised to grow. The expansion is partly the result of double-digit growth in Canadian operations, and the potential to increase it further in western Canada. ""The opportunities for our clients out west have been substantial, because that's where Canada's economic and population growth has been,"" says Eric Lamarre, managing partner for Canada. Vancouver itself has a diverse business community that's particularly strong in the natural resource sector. But Eric admits that the main rationale for the new office is the chance to create a new talent hub. ""Vancouver is the city where a great many Canadians and non-Canadians want to live,"" he says. For our global managing director, Dominic Barton, Vancouver's opening holds a special meaning. ""I grew up in BC and spent the first decade of my McKinsey career in our Canadian offices—and I am proud to see our firm have a presence in this important and dynamic region,"" he says. Dom spoke at the official office opening event at the Vancouver Board of Trade on September 9, which was attended by more than 250 local business leaders. Many on the new Vancouver team will come from our other locations. Miklos Dietz, Vancouver's new managing partner, moved with his family from Budapest after managing our office there. ""Canada is one of the most inspiring countries in the world,"" he says. ""To me, it's a great mix of what is good about North America—freedom, innovation, willingness to dream and challenge common wisdom—and a caring society like those found in Northern Europe. If you're a European and think about moving, it's likely that you want to come to Canada,"" and Vancouver specifically. ""Vancouver stands out even in Canada with its diversity, cosmopolitan culture and breathtaking beauty,"" he says. Likewise, principal Matías Marcote and his young family moved from Mexico City. ""It's actually my daughter's first birthday on the day we officially open the office—it could be a lucky sign,"" he says. Luckily for Miklos and his family, Vancouver is also the most livable city in North America (and third in the word), with the top-ranked education system in the western hemisphere . It's also one of the most diverse, with half of the city's residents speaking English as their second language. And it's green, with vast natural beauty and strong environmental leadership. Associate principal Benjamin Goodier knew all about Vancouver's accolades first hand—he grew up there, and worked remotely from the Calgary office. When he learned the firm would open an office in his hometown, he jumped at the opportunity to contribute. ""As someone from Vancouver, and for all the Vancouver folks in the firm, it's incredibly exciting to see McKinsey making this commitment to our community, because in the end, we believe it will benefit because of it."" Benjamin and Matías, worked throughout the year on the logistics, including finding the right office. The one they selected has a bonus: ""On clear days, it's got a phenomenal view over English Bay,"" Benjamin says. ""What's more,"" Matías notes, ""is that this office can really build a community, both with local Vancouver businesses, and amongst the consultants who will join the office."" One way he's fostering the latter is by donating a soft-serve ice cream machine to the office. He also stresses that the office, which will have 20 members by December, is the perfect size to build close mentoring relationships between colleagues. McKinsey first opened an office in Canada 47 years ago and soon after began serving clients from the southern border to the Canadian Arctic. Other Canadian offices include Calgary, Montreal, and Toronto. To date, we've served two-thirds of Canada's top companies, as well as many of its leading public-sector organizations.

September 22, 2015 Today we received recognition for our efforts to achieve gender equality here at McKinsey: a top ten position in Working Mother 's ranking of the 100 best employers in the United States . The ranking reflects the strength of the programs we've put in place to support working mothers and the excellent qualities that strong women bring to McKinsey. Recognition of this kind is humbling. While the Working Mother ranking is a significant accolade, we understand we aren't where we want to be in terms of gender diversity. Neither is the broader business world. That's why we're redoubling our efforts—including making specific commitments as part of the UN Women HeForShe campaign—and continuing to invest in research that analyzes the business case for gender diversity and contributes to greater understanding of the multiple factors that are barriers for women in the workplace . Keep an eye out later this week for the publication of a major research report by the McKinsey Global Institute exploring the contribution gender equality could make to global economic growth. On the ground, we've strengthened support for women at McKinsey with three new initiatives: All In All In is a McKinsey-wide effort, led by McKinsey partners reporting to our global managing director, to strengthen, attract, and develop colleagues with diverse backgrounds, leadership styles, and ways of thinking. The initial focus is on recruiting, retaining, and developing women. During its first year, All In helped expand existing programs (for example, our Next Generation Women Leaders Award and recruiting program) while also introducing brand-new elements, including training for both men and women on how unconscious biases affect business and decision making. Pace Pace adds a new dimension to our suite of flexibility programs by providing an option for consultants to stay in their current role without harming their prospects for advancement. While professional-services firms traditionally have used an ""up or out"" model, in which people advance at a standard rate, Pace gives participants greater control over their career progression. The program is open to all consultants and can be particularly helpful for women, who may feel intense pressure to catch up after maternity leave. Ramp Off, Ramp On Ramp Off, Ramp On started in North America and has now been rolled out globally. It provides expectant mothers with more advice, support, and information so they can prepare for an extended leave and stay connected during that leave—as much or as little as they wish. The program includes an assigned counselor who facilitates transitions and makes going on and returning from leave as seamless as possible. In addition, the counselor pays special attention to tailor the returning consultant's review process to account for her time away. We also want to acknowledge one of our colleagues who was instrumental in highlighting our efforts as part of the Working Mother evaluation process: director Celia Huber . Additionally, our honoree for Working Mother of the Year Nora Gardner , a principal in our Washington, DC, office, embodies our core value of ""make your own McKinsey."" She has created true work-life balance, leading collaborative efforts within our Organization and Public Sector Practices and spearheading many of our initiatives within McKinsey, all while raising her two young children.

October 8, 2015 Our acquisition of product and industrial-design firm LUNAR captured attention . What's less well known is that we have been quietly assembling an impressive corps of design talent. LUNAR aside, more than 50 McKinsey experience and digital designers are now working with clients in multidisciplinary consulting teams. Design studios are up and running in Berlin, London, New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. Why introduce experience design to the consulting mix? ""The rise of digital and mobile is a big part of the answer,"" says Hugo Sarrazin, a Silicon Valley–based director and leader of Digital Labs . ""Every company has opportunities to reimagine how it interacts with customers, suppliers, and employees. It is now often the source of new competitive differentiation or the trigger to build a new disruptive business model. Design thinking and rapid prototyping can be paired with our industry and functional expertise to form a pretty potent combination."" As Hugo concedes, however, getting designers and consultants to work together effectively isn't always easy at first. Design thinking is very different from the analytic style in which most consultants are trained. The trick is to focus not on what separates them but on what they share. Both use iterative problem solving approaches. Both are focused on client impact. ""Designers aren't people who simply create wire frames or apply colors; they are problem solvers and strategic thinkers who lead with people,"" says Jennifer Kilian , a digital VP based in New York who honed her skills at companies including Apple, Facebook, Frog Design, IBM, and Intuit. Not unlike our typical engagement, the archetypal design process starts with immersion, using a variety of research techniques—such as interviews, field research, and ethnography—to develop a deep understanding of customers. However, it is done to build true empathy for customer needs, pain points, and aspirations. Jared Braiterman , a Tokyo-based design VP and Stanford PhD anthropologist, puts it this way: ""Design is essentially about people, no matter the product, service, or business."" Next in the design process comes ideation: looking at adjacent situations, combining ideas, and using lateral thinking to address the pain points and identify possible solutions. The ideas that emerge are often diverse, so they need to be grouped and presented in some kind of framework, without which structured discussion is difficult. The last step is iteration, the process of testing and learning that refines prototypes into products and services that are ingenious and beautiful—while also being delightful (in the sense of fulfilling an unmet need) and incorporating signature moments (recognizable elements of the experience that a company can own). This last step is critical, rather than to seek a singular answer we create a process that maximizes learning with our clients. Empathy? Beauty? Signature moments? These elements may seem foreign to anyone with a strong left-brained orientation. Then again, the emphasis on customer insight, problem solving, logical framing, and above all getting to an answer that works is something every McKinsey consultant can embrace. ""We're not trying to turn McKinsey into a design-centered institution,"" says Hyo Yeon , a digital partner with Digital Labs whose pre-McKinsey career included senior roles at design agencies including Fjord and Razorfish. ""But we've found that by incorporating design thinking into how we serve clients we can significantly increase our collective impact as a team.""

Among the sobering takeaways from the research: at a macro level, global GDP realistically could increase by $12 trillion if women participated in the workforce on more equal terms with men. Yet, at a micro level, at the current rate of progress, US companies are still decades—or perhaps even a century—away from achieving gender parity at every level of the organization. Our goal is to galvanize and inform action on this critical economic and social issue. To get behind the numbers, we asked three senior McKinsey women to reflect on the research from the perspective of accomplished professionals. What resonates with them, and why? The Women in the workplace research revealed that women remain underrepresented at every stage of the talent pipeline. Among the companies surveyed, women account for 45 percent of employees at the entry level, but the number drops dramatically to 32 percent by midcareer and 17 percent at the top level of the organization. It's important that companies look at multiple ways to address this issue. Says Celia Huber , a McKinsey director: “Sponsorship is everything. A sponsor can create opportunities, instill confidence to make the most of those opportunities, and provide inspiration when times are tough.” McKinsey principal Kara Carter agrees: “The sponsorship point really hit home for me. I’ve had the tremendous benefit of wonderful sponsors—women and men—without whom I would not be where I am today. The research encouraged me to focus on making sure women I care about are connecting not just with women sponsors but also with senior men who can create meaningful opportunities for them.” Another key finding is that less than half of employees believe that gender diversity is a top priority for their CEO, even though 74 percent of companies report that their CEO is highly committed to diversity. For a variety of reasons, top management commitments often do not seem to be translating into changes in women's day-to-day reality in the workplace. The research showed, for example, that although many programs facilitate flexible working, employees often don’t participate for fear of damaging their career prospects. Tackling these issues requires acknowledging and changing the unconscious biases held by both men and women at senior levels. “The idea that you can have real meritocracy when decision makers are all one type is on its face not valid,” McKinsey principal Susan Colby says. “It speaks to an ongoing challenge: unconscious bias in the workplace.” One common theme arising from The power of parity and Women in the workplace is the disproportionate share of unpaid care work—everything from child care and elder care to cooking and domestic chores—carried out by women around the world. Even in supposedly developed economies, this imbalance leaves many women feeling boxed in and unable or unwilling to take career risks. Says Susan: “I think many women make decisions that are someone else’s: a society or a culture or a husband that doesn’t want them to work. If you don’t understand yourself and your choices, you live someone else’s life and never discover your own equilibrium. My biggest wish for women in the thick of it is that they empower themselves to make their own decisions.” Never miss a story","McKinsey is committed to gender equality, highlighting initiatives like HeForShe and research revealing that global GDP could increase by $12 trillion with equal workforce participation.

TechPrep: Finding and inspiring the technologists of the future with Facebook,It’s no secret that the technology sector struggles with diversity. Engineers at tech’s biggest and brightest companies are predominantly white and male. This is not only an ethical issue but also a looming economic problem.,2015-10-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Digital,Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/techprep,"TechPrep: Finding and inspiring the technologists of the future with Facebook October 30, 2015 It’s no secret that the technology sector struggles with diversity. Engineers at tech’s biggest and brightest companies are predominantly white and male. This is not only an ethical issue but also a looming economic problem. By 2020, there could be one million programming jobs unfilled in the United States; encouraging a wider swath of the population to pursue technology careers is part of the solution. Such is the background to our support for Facebook’s TechPrep initiative, which launched last week. A California-based McKinsey team led by Susan Colby , James Manyika , Helen Ma, Kelsey Robinson, and Lareina Yee worked with Facebook for several months to research and understand ways to boost the talent pipeline of young people of color and women in tech. The team researched the attitudes of parents and children to careers in programming and then curated an online platform to provide the information and resources they need. The TechPrep website features resources, profiles, and videos in English and in Spanish to spark interest, inform, and inspire. “The lack of diversity in most tech organizations—and many organizations in general—means that we’re not getting the benefit of the full talent pool. And for these young people, the opportunities that careers in tech bring are tremendous,” says Susan. The team brought together members with expertise in social-science research, consumer marketing, user experience, technology, and education. The nature of the project quickly became personal. “I never even considered computer science as a career, so it’s been really interesting to think about why I didn’t pursue it. Others on the team with technical backgrounds felt a personal commitment to this cause. I think this is one of the most meaningful projects that the team has done,"" says Kelsey. Kevin Caldwell, an associate based in San Francisco, agrees. “I grew up in a community where economics had limited many people’s educational opportunities.  But at an early age, I discovered that I could speak the language of math and science.  It just clicked,"" says Kevin.  “I want to see that happen for more kids today.” “Many of us are parents who are trying to encourage our kids too. Even though I’m in this field, I learned a ton,” explains Lareina. She was happy to learn from the team’s research that Minecraft, beloved by her two young sons, is also a helpful introduction to programming concepts. The path to achieving parity in tech holds different obstacles for girls, Latinos, and African-Americans. “The barriers are not one-size-fits-all,” says Lareina. For African-Americans and Latinos, less awareness of computer science is due to less access to both people and programs in computer science. This significantly contributes to decisions about dropping out of the field when the same groups decide to pursue it. Meanwhile, women and girls use the computer science resources available to them at a lower rate than men and boys. Only 24 percent of females take computer classes in school, compared to 35 percent of males. And only 33 percent of women and girls say they would be good at working with computers, compared with half of men and boys. What’s more, parents are largely unaware of how to encourage their children to pursue computer science: 77 percent say they don’t know how to help their children in this regard at all. That figure increases to 83 percent for parents without college degrees or with lower incomes. When women, African-Americans, and Latinos report that being encouraged to pursue computer science by a parent or guardian was a primary motivator, there’s reason to believe an increase in parental awareness and involvement could yield dividends in the future for a diverse body of technologists. What does the future hold? For the initiative, McKinsey will continue as a research partner to Facebook and share some of the key findings garnered from the project. “The research is not exclusive to Facebook. In fact from day one the goal has been to create an open platform and pipeline (hence the age range) that benefits the sector as a whole and society at large. So colleagues are encouraged to draw on this research and leverage it with their own clients and others in the tech community,” James explains. For computer science and technical professions, “We have an enormous way to go for girls and underserved populations, but I think the awareness has improved. It’s starting to become more transparent that we don’t have a true representation of the population in these professions,” Lareina says. Learn more about our Education Practice .

The seaside town in northern France is home to the annual meeting of the Women's Forum for the Economy and Society , which has grown in 10 years to become an important date on the European business calendar. We've been pleased to partner with the Women's Forum since 2006, each year sharing the latest findings from our Women Matter research program.

Sandrine Devillard , a director based in Paris, and Anu Madgavkar , a McKinsey Global Institute senior fellow based in Mumbai, presented highlights from our recent report, The power of parity , which looks at the potential for increased gender equality to boost economic growth. As with our partnerships with Facebook , the UN's HeForShe initiative, and LeanIn.Org , Deauville is part of a bigger commitment to create a fact-based dialogue that leads to concrete action. This year, the McKinsey team also helped to convene and facilitate a private workshop for 45 senior leaders from private- and public-sector institutions, plus 15 diversity experts, as part of the forum's CEO Champions initiative. As befits a workshop, participants were made to work—split into groups and pushed to explore big ideas that could challenge the organizational status quo. How about appointing male and female co-CEOs? Or creating a gender-parity index to assess organizations on critical indicators? Look for a forthcoming white paper capturing the group's ideas and reactions.

The deal is our fourth acquisition of 2015, in areas ranging from product design to pricing optimization . We’ve also entered into a number of strategic partnerships, some involving equity investments. Behind these deals is a deliberate strategy to bring new tools, technologies, and capabilities to McKinsey clients, says Daniel Pacthod leader of our New Ventures unit: “Clients are asking us for more than just advice. We’re building some terrific new capabilities organically and we’re actively looking for partnerships or acquisitions where it makes sense.” QuantumBlack’s roughly 45 employees will continue to operate from their existing premises in London’s Tech City under the company’s distinctive name. However, the acquisition opens the door to work jointly with McKinsey teams on client projects across a wide range of industries. “Differences between teams [in Formula 1] are measured in milliseconds so they look for every available opportunity to make improvements,” says QuantumBlack co-founder Simon Williams. “Analyzing data at scale is a way to optimize the performance not only of cars but also of engineering teams and whole organizations.” Nicolaus Henke, head of McKinsey Analytics , said “Data analytics is one of the most disruptive and potentially transformative developments in management. QuantumBlack, through its Nerve platform, combines data from disparate sources to produce meaningful data around human endeavor—something that previously has not been reliably measured.  This is why we’re so excited about the combination of our organizations—together we can provide our clients with a completely new means of making decisions and converting knowledge into action.” “We’ve always been strong when it comes to working at the leadership level, and we bring fantastic analytical skill,” says Jeremy Palmer, QuantumBlack’s Chief Executive. “But what we haven’t yet had is the kind of broad domain expertise and implementation capabilities that McKinsey brings.” Bill Wiseman , head of McKinsey Analytics in Asia, said “McKinsey and QuantumBlack worked together for more than a year in a number of industries. This approach to organizational performance requires not only a flair for statistics but also industry expertise, experience implementing change programs, and earned credibility with senior executives—all of which are McKinsey strengths.” In a typical project, once objectives are agreed upon with the client, the first step is to bring together large amounts data from disparate sources—everything from engineering systems to performance-management systems to email servers. The consulting team then applies sophisticated analytical techniques (usually including machine learning) to find out what drives performance and uses data visualization to render the findings in a way that brings them alive for client executives. At this point, the rubber really meets the road: working with the client to decide on a course of action, align employees and other stakeholders, and make change happen over weeks and months. Sven Smit , head of McKinsey Western Europe, notes that the McKinsey and QuantumBlack teams worked together successfully on a number of client projects before an acquisition was mooted. Even so, he concedes that making acquisitions work is never easy. The keys to success? “We’re doing what we advise clients to do in these circumstances: get to know each other really well and develop a winning shared forward plan and put real resources into post-deal support. The deal doesn’t end when the ink is dry.” Never miss a story","McKinsey acquired QuantumBlack, a London-based analytics firm rooted in Formula 1, to enhance client offerings through advanced data analysis.

This was the thinking behind a series of workshops at our recent Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII) conference, outside of San Francisco. Participants were asked to provide ideas and advice on how to plan, finance, build, and operate a new multibillion-dollar rail tunnel under San Francisco Bay. The proposed Transbay Tunnel would be one of California’s largest infrastructure projects and could help maintain the growth trajectory of the $700 billion regional economy. If the San Francisco Bay Area were a country, it would slot between Saudi Arabia and Sweden in the global pecking order. Moreover, the region is expected to add 1.5 million new residents over the next 25 years. Making it easier for people to move quickly and easily across the eponymous bay is an economic necessity. To be sure, there are things that the region could do now that don’t involve digging tunnels, such as improving the efficiency of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (which already runs via a single tunnel under the bay) and adding more ferries. Yet these patches, while useful, would not be enough to cope with the future demand. “We’re not going to be able to sustain growth if we can’t unlock the potential of mobility that the Transbay Tunnel would bring,” says Ed Reiskin, director of transportation of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. As currently envisioned, the new four-mile tunnel between the cities of San Francisco and Oakland would carry two commuter-train lines and two high-speed tracks. Once built, it would reduce commuting times and bolster the whole transit system’s capacity and resilience. The GII workshops revealed little concern about the engineering side of the project: big infrastructure companies know how to build tunnels. Consensus among the assembled brain trust was that the bigger challenges relate to planning, politics, and finance. A taste of the discussions: The GII team is now expanding upon these and other recommendations and synthesizing them into a white paper for the consideration of Bay Area political leaders and planners. The result may not be as visually stunning as the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, but it could be every bit as important to the economic future of the region.

Modeling a new approach to patient care with analytics,"Patients undergo more than 600,000 knee replacements every year in the United States. But not all knees are created equal.

But not all knees are created equal. A 35-year-old athlete may need a simpler, less costly surgery than an 82-year-old with severe arthritis. The hospitals that treat both patients often are paid by the number of services they deliver—not necessarily the outcome and quality. The first step to improving patient care, the critical challenge in healthcare analytics , is to make it more measurable and factual across a single “episode of care,” such as a knee replacement or pregnancy or heart attack. Explains Alex Beauvais , vice president and general manager of our healthcare analytics group: “We can map diverse patient journeys across thousands of cases to make measurable, apple-to-apple comparisons that are clinically and technically reliable. For each episode of care, we have physicians and medical coders who can design these patient journeys and identify the sources of value within them—for example, using an outpatient setting rather than a hospital. Then our advanced-analytics and technology staff guide the data inputs and modeling from start to finish. We take into account the many variations, including outlier cases within a single episode of care.” A key focus area for Alex’s team is eventually using these episodes of care and tangible facts to develop payment models that incent providers to shift from delivering “more individual services” to focusing on “overall better patient outcomes.” With an MBA and extensive technology experience, Alex joined McKinsey seven years ago to help build our big data capabilities and eventually focused exclusively on healthcare. Today, our North America–based team counts some 100 physicians, medical coders, data scientists, statisticians, and software developers among their ranks—working alongside strategists, consultants, and project managers. They design and develop algorithms and run analytics on a big data platform that integrates 100 terabytes of proprietary and third-party claim, encounter, and clinical data. McKinsey also has a healthcare-analytics team in Europe. “We can help a client define a strategy and also design a comprehensive model loaded with production-grade algorithms to forecast the impact of that strategy,” Alex says. The team is also developing models related to primary care, provider performance and growth, payment integrity, and special-needs populations. Modeling data is an art as well as a science. Gerold Scheunemann, a senior data scientist based in Dusseldorf, has over 15 years of experience in analytics. He explains: “Success isn’t about just having the most powerful or complicated model; it’s about having a powerful model and getting the right information into that model. After all, data are always neutral. They tell you the truth only when they include all the relevant information. A highly sophisticated model with insufficient data is much less useful than a good model with a comprehensive database.” One other area where analytics can play a significant role is improving the quality of care for the long-term population suffering from mental illness or behavioral-health conditions. “This is a very nebulous area in healthcare, and often a patient will have several interrelated conditions,” says Alex. With analytics, we can help payors and providers better understand such a population, with answers to questions like these: How many patients have multiple conditions? What is the optimum care-delivery mechanism for each condition? What factors explain why some people stick to their meds and others do not? “With analytics, for the first time we can put facts on the table,” notes Alex, “and that completely changes the conversation.” Never miss a story","Healthcare analytics aims to improve patient care by measuring and comparing treatment outcomes across different patient journeys, such as knee replacements.

Decoding Davos,Why go to Davos? Because the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the mountains of Switzerland remains a unique opportunity to connect efficiently and effectively with an extraordinary number of clients and key decision-makers.,2016-01-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Davos,Europe,Global Managing Partner",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/decoding-davos,"Decoding Davos From left: Dominic Barton, McKinsey’s global managing director, Dennis Nally, chairman, PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd., Jean-Pascal Tricoire, CEO Schneider Electric, and Emma Watson during a panel discussion promoting gender parity. January 29, 2016 by Dominic Barton —Why go to Davos? Because the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the mountains of Switzerland remains a unique opportunity to connect efficiently and effectively with an extraordinary number of clients and key decision-makers. After four intense days of formal sessions, one-on-one meetings, and snatched conversations I always come away with a sharper sense of the issues to which we—and our clients—should be paying attention. This year was no exception. As a firm we send five official delegates—this year myself plus Cornelius Baur, Gary Pinkus , Vivian Riefberg, and Kevin Sneader. What do we actually do? Well, among other things: We hosted four dinners with a broad range of CEOs to explore the topics of  digitization and analytics; we held a breakfast discussion on the topic of “ Organizing for the Future ,” featuring Carlos Ghosn of the Nissan Alliance and Randall Stephenson of ATT; Kevin spoke alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron and Queen Rania of Jordan on the challenge of finding sustainable jobs for refugees; Vivian spoke at both The Girls’ Lounge (the first female-focused, male-inclusive destination for women at Davos), and a Seneca Women event; along with Larry Fink of BlackRock, Mark Wiseman of CPPIB, Andrew Liveris of Dow and Cyrus Mistry of Tata Group, I co-hosted a two hour working session with CEOs and institutional investors who are members of our Focusing Capital on the Long Term initiative. On Friday, I also took part in an event hosted by UN Women as part of their HeForShe initiative , promoting gender parity. We are one of the ten ‘corporate impact champions.’ Actress Emma Watson chaired an interesting discussion involving other impact champions including the CEOs of Twitter, Unilever, and Schneider. As part of HeForShe, we have made public for the first time data about our own progress towards gender parity within McKinsey. The figures are a reminder of the challenge we, along with other organizations, face—particularly in retaining women as they progress towards senior leadership positions. We have put in place a number of measures to address this but have a long way to go. We also found time for meetings with close to 300 clients and contacts. Yes, good calendar management remains a core competence. As for the ‘big themes’ that dominated discussion, here are six that struck me as particularly interesting: The technology revolution rolls on. Discussion centered on the speed, scale and force at which technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, nanotechnology, and biotech are transforming industries and markets. Without doubt, this is changing our lives and the lives of future generations. We heard genuine excitement about the opportunities created by these technologies—along with concern about the societal challenges, especially with respect to job creation. Global growth isn’t over. Financial and commodity markets convulsed during the week, with oil plunging and share prices sinking. But the overall picture on growth was more positive than this suggests. Our own sense, echoed by a number of others, is that while the macro-economic outlook remains tough in the first half—and we may not yet be done on the downside—things will probably pick up in the second half. China isn’t over. Is a hard landing ahead? Or is China’s economic deceleration just part of an essential transition? We tend to share the mindset of those who would prefer to see a sustainable 5-6% growth this year led by services than an unsustainable 9-10% growth led by investment. India too continues to generate optimism and a sense that real change may be underway. Geopolitical worries. Regional conflicts, terrorism and the threat of ISIS loomed large in political discussions, as did the ongoing humanitarian tragedy of the refugee crisis in Europe—which many now see as a “make or break” challenge for the EU. Nationalism is clearly rising, and we still lack a clear framework for how the international order should evolve. Organizational change. Business leaders feel under intense pressure to keep evolving business models and operating models, both to fend off new competitors and to take advantage of emerging technologies such as automation and machine learning. This requires a willingness to retool processes, retrain people, and invest capital at scale, all amid deep uncertainty. Many CEOs see this as being the defining issue of their tenure. Focusing executives on the long-term. It is no secret that this is one of my personal passions. The corollary to being able to adapt to rapid change is the imperative to resist short term pressures and manage companies for the long term. Based on conversations at Davos, we aim to deepen conversations with boards and executives and also explore regulatory changes and new metrics that can help move the needle in the right direction. Every country and company faces unique challenges. But as this WEF reminded us, our common task is to adapt successfully to some of the deepest long-term technological changes we have faced in our careers—all while coping with a geopolitical and macro-economic context that grows more volatile. We returned from Davos determined to keep innovating to help our clients do just that.

A new deal in risk&mdash;our latest acquisition,It’s a time of great change in the sometimes arcane but always mission-critical world of risk management. Regulators globally are pushing financial institutions for more robust methodologies and models to manage the risks embedded in their balance sheets and operations.,2016-02-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Acquisitions,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-new-deal-in-risk,"A new deal in risk—our latest acquisition February 3, 2016 It’s a time of great change in the sometimes arcane but always mission-critical world of risk management. Regulators globally are pushing financial institutions for more robust methodologies and models to manage the risks embedded in their balance sheets and operations. Meanwhile, automation and digitization will change the tools and techniques at their disposal in ways that most banks, insurers, and asset managers are only just starting to embrace. Such is the background to our acquisition of Risk Dynamics , a leading risk analytics firm based in Brussels that specializes in risk model validation and advisory. “It would be an understatement to say that getting risk right is a priority for our financial sector clients,” says Cindy Levy , who leads McKinsey’s Risk Practice across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. While our Risk Practice comprises about 400 consultants—including a growing advanced analytics capability—the 35-strong Risk Dynamics team brings some unique capabilities to clients, including deep expertise in model validation, which is the critical business of stress-testing risk management models to ensure they are mathematically robust. The deal is a further sign of McKinsey’s willingness to make targeted acquisitions in order to accelerate bringing new services and expertise to clients. In December, the firm announced the acquisition of QuantumBlack , a London-based consultancy that is pioneering the use of big data to improve organizational performance. Other recent acquisitions have been in fields ranging from product design to pricing optimization. Risk Dynamics was founded in 2003 by Dominique and Olivier Bourrat, a wife and husband team with backgrounds respectively in quantitative finance and business consulting. Dominique earned a PhD in nuclear physics before moving into financial engineering at an investment bank and then risk management. Olivier, meanwhile, worked for international consulting firms in Belgium, Paris, and London. Risk Dynamics’ (metaphorical) marriage of quantitative skills, business insight, and innovative methodologies is one of the things that piqued McKinsey’s interest. “Their team includes some real quants but we’ve found them to be very insightful about the challenges facing the industry,” Cindy says. “They share the same ‘from the engine room to the board room’ approach we bring to clients.” Another shared interest is pushing the boundaries of knowledge to help clients manage new issues and regulations as they arise. As an example, Olivier points to “model landscape risk”—the headache-inducing challenge of understanding the interplay and governance of the dozens (or even hundreds) of different risk models being used within a single financial institution. Looking further ahead, Dominique notes that the emergence of machine learning and other computer-based forms of predictive analytics as something that financial institutions and their regulators will need to address: “It’s fine to build a risk model based on machine learning, but how do you validate it? That’s a question we are keen to help clients and regulators answer.” After the acquisition, Risk Dynamics will continue to operate from its Brussels offices, with its entire management team playing an active role in expanding the business globally under its existing brand. Early priorities include opening a US hub and embarking on an energetic recruiting effort. Cindy says: “Fundamentally, this is about building the world’s preeminent risk analytics and model advisory firm.” Never miss a story","McKinsey has acquired Risk Dynamics, a Brussels-based risk analytics firm, to enhance its risk management services.

Grow smart. McKinsey principal Kara Sprague presenting research about high growth software  companies at a Technonomy conference. February 22, 2016 When big corporations are plotting growth strategies, their ambitions are often limited to growth rates in, say, the high single digits. For up-and-coming technology companies, that's a recipe for irrelevance—or worse. Only a very small percentage of tech start-ups manage to grow fast enough for long enough to become industry heavyweights. Of ~3,200 start-ups tracked in a recent McKinsey study , just 0.6 percent managed to hit $4 billion in annual sales. “If you're an early-stage tech company, and you're not growing fast enough, you're going to die a slow death. Oftentimes we see companies start to plateau—they stick around for a while hoping to regain their growth. But, in reality, very few do,” observes Kara Sprague, a San Francisco–based principal and member of our Growth Tech Practice . Kara studied computer science and electrical engineering at MIT and started her career as a software engineer. Today she helps small to midsize tech companies bring fact-based problem solving to their aggressive pursuit of growth. Clients are often entrepreneurs, running businesses employing 50 to 500 people, with revenues of $20 million to $200 million. Typically, they have developed and launched a successful product and are shifting their focus to achieving rapid scale. “We help them with the same growing pains our larger clients face: how to price products, how to improve sales effectiveness, how to operate more effectively,” explains Peter Weed, a principal in our Boston office. He founded the Growth Tech Practice with Eric Kutcher , a Silicon Valley-based director, with the specific aim of helping next-generation technology giants realize their potential. We’ve had to innovate our consulting model to meet the needs of these clients. Consulting projects typically run from 4 to 6 weeks instead of 3 months or longer. Project teams are smaller. The working style is decidedly different, too. “If you present a clear argument that’s backed up by data, CEOs can make a decision with little or no approval process. Within 5 minutes, it’s shared with the whole company,” says Adam Taylor, an associate principal in our Silicon Valley office who trained as a computer scientist and worked as an engineer in the video-game industry prior to joining McKinsey. While the Growth Tech Practice started in the United States, the model is being rolled out globally, including in India, Malaysia, and Scandinavia. As Eric Kutcher observes: “The next Google is as likely to be located in Brasilia, Shenzhen, or Tel Aviv as in California.” Sahana Sarma, another MIT-trained computer scientist turned McKinsey principal, is helping to build the practice in India, which has a thriving ecosystem of early-stage tech companies. “We are helping them navigate the complexities of operating in India as well as understand how they stack up internationally,” she says. Regardless of geography, pricing is often top of mind for Growth Tech clients because their products and services are first of a kind. As Adam recalls, “We helped one mobile-app company re-bundle its service to play in a higher-value segment. It was able to raise its price by 30 percent—because we could quickly build the fact base needed to test pricing.” Another Growth Tech client had some 40 strategic investments on the table—an embarrassment of riches that had become paralyzing. The McKinsey team facilitated a decision-making process to help the management team pare this down to a smaller set of initiatives and develop a clear story. With a well-articulated 3-year strategy, the company could raise the capital it needed to grow at a more attractive valuation. What do McKinsey’s multibillion-dollar tech clients make of our work with these (relative) minnows? Says Eric, “They want to know what the ‘ankle biters’ are doing. We can help them understand the trends, the new models, where the next big disruption may be coming from. In some cases, we can make helpful introductions.” Never miss a story","Kara Sprague of McKinsey highlights the challenges high-growth tech companies face, noting that only 0.6% of startups reach $4 billion in sales.

More than 10,000 Indian and international companies converged on Mumbai for a week of exhibitions, seminars, and panel discussions. The goal: to draw global attention to the potential of India’s manufacturing sector. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid out a bold ambition to increase manufacturing’s contribution to India’s GDP from 14 percent to 25 percent by 2022—creating 100 million jobs in the process. Meeting this goal will require not only global investment in Indian manufacturing but also a commitment by Indian companies to increase the efficiency and sophistication of their operations. Our involvement with “Make in India” started with conversations with India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The ministry, desiring to recognize companies that were investing in high-quality manufacturing, had worked with editorial and business leaders at Time magazine to hatch a new set of awards for manufacturing excellence. So that the awards would be truly aspirational, they would be handed out at the summit by Prime Minister Modi. But how to screen the entries and develop a process for selecting winners? This is where McKinsey could help. With less than 3 months to build the awards process from scratch, the McKinsey team based in our Gurgaon office had to hit the ground running. The team was led by Rajat Dhawan , a director and leader of our Operations Practice in Asia. A chemical engineer by training, Rajat has worked with automotive, steel, and other manufacturers in China, Germany, India, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and beyond. “From the start, we all wanted the awards to measure not just the profitability of an enterprise, but also their business practices and capability to transform the world around them,’’ Rajat says. With this guiding principle in mind, the McKinsey team helped to define the award categories and eligibility criteria. Ashok Kumar, our senior expert, from the Asia Operations team, took the lead setting up a solid and transparent process. Ashok, formerly a commissioned officer in the Indian Air Force, knew he was running against the clock on this project. Time magazine, with our assistance, then invited nominations from a long list of companies that had recorded an economic profit over the past 5 years. Simultaneously, we helped assemble a jury to pick the winners. Norman Pearlstine, executive vice president and chief content officer for Time Inc., was our jury chair. The jury membership consisted of John Rice, vice chairman of General Electric; N. R. Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys; Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank; Carlos Ghosn, chairman and CEO of Renault-Nissan; Kevin Sneader , chairman, Asia, McKinsey & Company; and Rana Foroohar, assistant managing editor of Time. As the closing date approached, applications poured in for the three main awards: Best in Class Manufacturing (ultimately won by Tata Steel), Manufacturing Innovator of the Year (won by Hero Motor), and Young Makers of the Year (won by Yogesh and Rajesh Agrawal of Ajanta Pharma.) The winners received their crystal trophies from the prime minister at a glittering event in Mumbai. There was no crystal trophy for the McKinsey team—just plenty of pride at having helped kick-start a movement to manufacture better and more efficiently in India.

From his home in South Africa, he travels widely across the continent, visiting not only the six other African countries in which we have offices but also an additional dozen or so in which we serve clients regularly. What’s more, he does it all on a Cameroonian passport, which, as he says ruefully, “doesn’t help me very much at all” when it comes to visa-free travel across African borders. Such headaches are familiar to most Africans doing international business on the continent. For all the talk of a pan-African passport, free movement for Africans within Africa remains a distant prospect. One finding from a recent African Development Bank Group (AfDB) report : It is easier for North Americans to travel within Africa than it is for Africans themselves. What’s more, only 13 out of 55 African countries offer liberal access—defined as visa free or visa on arrival—to all Africans. That’s bad news for a continent aiming for closer economic integration as a spur to trade, tourism, and economic growth. The AfDB report, produced with the help of McKinsey and the World Economic Forum, is the first to rank African countries according to the openness (or not) of their visa regulations for African citizens. At the top of the Africa Visa Openness Index are the Seychelles, Mali, Uganda, Cape Verde, and Togo. These countries have instituted either visa-free or visa-on-arrival policies for citizens of all African countries. “You can see the positive impact on the number of visitors to those countries,” says Acha. “Over time, you’ll also see it in the trade figures.” So why don’t more African countries open up? Security is one concern, despite evidence that visas aren’t a powerful deterrent to international terrorists. (More effective measures include biometric screening at points of entry and joining IT systems with other countries.) A more prosaic reason is that many embassies depend on visa fees for income. While this is surmountable—visa fees can be collected from visitors on arrival and channeled back to the relevant embassies—the potential hit to cash flow is a very real cause of resistance to change in the diplomatic corps. Perhaps most important of all, many governments fear that loosening visa restrictions will lead to an influx of cheap migrant labor. This helps explain why economic heavyweights such as South Africa and Morocco are in the bottom half of the openness index. Still, the African Development Bank hopes that tracking and ranking countries will stimulate constructive debate about the benefits of greater openness. The report highlights the example of Rwanda, where the reform-minded government implemented a visa-on-arrival policy for all Africans and halved the price of a visa to $30. Other bright spots include the Economic Community of West African States, which has a policy of open reciprocity among the 15 member states, which include Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal. If you hail from elsewhere in Africa, however, bad luck. National rules still apply. McKinsey as a whole has an enlightened self-interest in the topic. With more than 300 consultants based in our African offices—and a further 100 or so flying in regularly—it takes administrative heroics and hundreds of embassy visits every year to assemble the best teams on the ground for our clients. Says Acha: “Multiply this by millions to get a sense of why Africa has a problem.” Our seven offices on the African continent are: Angola Luanda ; Egypt Cairo; Ethiopia Addis Ababa ; Kenya Nairobi ; Morocco Casablanca ; Nigeria Lagos ; and South Africa Johannesburg .

But how can European governments implement reforms without losing popular support? To answer this question, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has launched a contest which offers a €100,000 prize pool for innovative ideas to stimulate economic growth while also winning the hearts and minds of European electorates: the MGI Essay Prize—An Opportunity for Europe . The idea for the prize germinated last year in the run-up to the publication of A window of opportunity for Europe , an MGI report that identified the potential for Europe to double its current growth rate and create more than 20 million jobs. While the analysis was powerful, the report’s authors (led by McKinsey directors Richard Dobbs , Eric Labaye , Sven Smit , Eckart Windhagen, and by MGI senior fellow Jan Mischke ) knew that more would be required to move policy makers to action. “The challenge is not just the analysis, but getting the debate going about what it would take to implement the required changes—hence a global prize,” Richard says. As Eckart puts it: “We wanted to get the flywheel going.” When the MGI team floated the idea of an essay contest with officials across Europe, the response was favorable—so favorable, in fact, that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker offered his patronage. It was this former prime minister of Luxembourg who in 2007 articulated the central dilemma essay authors will need to address: “We all know what to do, but we don’t know how to get reelected once we have done it.” In fact, as Eric points out, one of the findings of the MGI report was that the European public is keen to break out of the current frustrating economic cycle; a majority of the 16,000 Europeans polled for the report in eight countries said they were willing to make trade-offs in return for improved incomes and better public services. With the prize, Eric says, “We hope to create momentum by focusing on the practical ways this could be achieved.” The essay contest also intrigued Pascal Lamy, a former European trade commissioner and ex-director general of the World Trade Organization, who will serve as chairman of the judging panel . The other members of the jury reflect Europe’s economic, political, social, and geographical diversity. They include a German labor-union leader, Reiner Hoffmann; the business-affairs editor of The Economist, Andrew Palmer; the director of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) European Policy Office in Brussels, Geneviève Pons; and a Polish CEO, Ewa Szmidt-Belcarz. While McKinsey employees are not eligible to enter the contest, we encourage you to spread the word. Submissions are due by July 31, 2016, and the awards will be presented at a dinner in Brussels in October organized by MGI’s think-tank partner for the contest, Friends of Europe . In the meantime, look for flyers publicizing the contest at think tanks and universities across the Continent and join the conversation on social media with the hashtag #EssayforEurope . “We believe there are many good ideas, but not much of an open dialogue,” Sven says. “The prize could be a small catalyst to create conversations.” Never miss a story","The McKinsey Global Institute launched the MGI Essay Prize, offering a €100,000 prize pool for innovative ideas to stimulate economic growth in Europe while maintaining public support.

Reverse innovation gets real: Announcing the McKinsey Award winners,We&rsquo;re delighted to announce this year&rsquo;s winners for best article in the Harvard Business Review.,2016-03-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Awards,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/innovating-for-the-world,"Reverse innovation gets real: Announcing the McKinsey Award winners A user tests the Leveraged Freedom Chair, which was built using the principles of reverse innovation. March 22, 2016 We are delighted to announce the winner of the 57th annual McKinsey Award for the best Harvard Business Review article of the year: “ Engineering Reverse Innovation ,” by business school professor Vijay Govindarajan and engineering professor Amos G. Winter . While the concept of reverse innovation is not new ( Govindarajan’s 2012 book on the topic was a New York Times bestseller), companies still struggle to create successful products for emerging economies that can be rolled out globally. To help bridge the gap between aspiration and execution, the article lays out five principles that can be used by product development teams to facilitate the process. We sat down with the authors to learn more: Congratulations on winning the McKinsey Award, Vijay and Amos. Why is reverse innovation important to you? Vijay: It's very humbling to win this Award as it highlights the importance of the topic, that's what I'm most happy about. I was born and brought up in India. What I saw in India was lots of problems but very few resources. The only way to solve our problems was through innovation. We couldn’t throw money at the problems since we didn’t have the resources. So, when I came to Harvard Business School to study, I really committed myself to understanding all aspects of “innovation,” innovation for America, by American companies. When Jeff Immelt invited me to join GE as chief innovation consultant, he sent me to India and China to see how GE could grow in those two markets by converting “non-consumers” into consumers, we had to innovate more. For example, GE makes a $20,000 EKG (electrocardiogram) machine in the US. Ninety percent of Indian hospitals can’t afford it. That doesn’t mean non-consumers don’t suffer from heart attacks. Non-consumers in the world have exactly the same heart problems as consumers. Innovation can convert the former to the latter, which is what GE did: GE created a $500 EKG machine, which opened up the whole Indian market. That high-quality, low-cost machine has now been adopted in 90 countries, including rich ones. And that’s when I coined the term “reverse innovation.” Innovation doesn’t always have to start from a rich country and go to a poor country. It can also come in reverse—innovation can first be adopted in a poor country and then it can defy gravity and flow upwards. Jeff and I wrote an article about it in 2009. Since then, I’ve devoted a lot of my time and energy to that topic—which is how Amos found me. Amos: At MIT, my research group focuses on creating technologies for developing markets, and so we are doing reverse innovation all the time. We are motivated by the great humanitarian challenges as well as economic potential. We design to capture those opportunities, but we’re always looking at wealthy markets as well, and asking ourselves, “OK, if we can make a high-performance and low-cost solution, what would that look like in wealthy markets as well as poor markets, and can we design for both concurrently?” The Leveraged Freedom Chair project was motivated initially by the needs of users in the developing world, where the majority of people who need wheelchairs live in rural areas. There were no good products for users who need to travel long distances over rough ground while also having the maneuverability indoors of a small wheelchair. As Leveraged Freedom Chair started to get exposure, users in the US, Europe, and Canada started contacting us. It turned out they wanted one too. We realized that actually there were two distinct market opportunities for this technology. So we designed a version for more wealthy markets. We now serve these two groups of users, increasing their well-being while also trying to turn a profit. How did you come to collaborate? Amos: A few years ago, I read Vijay’s book Reverse Innovation. As a mechanical engineer who designs stuff for developing markets, I was blown away. But Vijay's book gives a strategy perspective. If you are the engineer tasked with designing a product for this new market, the book doesn’t give you a process for how to do reverse innovation. So, I approached Vijay and we immediately found that we were kindred spirits. As we talked, we both really liked the idea of trying to describe the steps to actually do reverse innovation if you are an engineer, and in describing the  overlapping standpoint of strategy in engineering. Vijay: How can a general manager have a meaningful conversation with an engineering team about the engineering principles behind reverse innovation? How do you organize the product development process to do it? We didn’t articulate these issues in the original article (with Jeff Immelt.) It’s a marvelous journey for me to work with Amos because every innovation is a marriage between technology and strategy. Amos is a professor of engineering and I’m a professor of business. Our coming together is an example of cross-disciplinary, cross-functional, university-wide collaboration which is going to be the hallmark of academia. Why do businesses struggle with reverse innovation? Amos : A few reasons: the first is that since World War II, product development has been focused on wealthy markets. As an American, designing a product for US customers, I have an inherent understanding of their needs because they are very similar to my own. But when I start trying to design for, say, a 50-year-old mother of five in Tanzania who's using a wood-fired stove every day, I have no inherent understanding of that person's context. It can be very difficult to design for that person, particularly if you are not interacting with him or her directly. The second reason is that companies that try to adapt existing products to developing economies often mistake value for cheapness. They think removing features and cutting prices will make their products appealing. But they start by stripping the value of the product, and users won’t want to buy it because it’s not good anymore. This approach hasn’t worked. So let’s instead start with these poor users and leverage the constraints they have to create very high-value technologies. A question I get all the time is, “Why not just design cheaper, better products for rich countries?” The answer is, because we don’t have to, because people are already buying our more expensive stuff in wealthier countries. In poor countries, it’s not optional to make a product that is higher performance and lower cost. It’s a must-have if you want to succeed. You may have to make the product more robust, you may have to make it strong enough to survive a bumpy road along the delivery chain. Vijay : Exactly. You see, I am so passionate about reverse innovation because it is one way by which we can address income inequality, the most important problem humanity faces today. Capitalists should use their capabilities and resources to innovate for the poor, thereby giving the poor income mobility. GE makes money off its highly affordable EKG machine, but at the same time GE is extending the productive life of a human being. When Amos innovated a low-cost wheelchair, he was also addressing income inequality. He’s giving someone in rural Africa mobility and the opportunity to earn more. Reverse innovation is about doing good while making money. If a corporation leverages its competencies to deliver shareholder return and at the same time addresses inequality, I think that has to be the highest form of human achievement. That is the potential of reverse innovation. What are you both working on now? Vijay: I’ve just finished a new book called The Three Box Solution . It’s the framework I’ve been using for the last 35 years. I put everything a company does into three boxes: Working with organizations, I find that they focus primarily on Box 1 which is all about operational excellence. While that’s important, Boxes 2 and 3 are equally important: they’re about growth and innovation. The challenge of leadership is how you create your future, while managing the present. Reverse innovation is an example of a Box 3 strategy. Amos: I'm working on a big problem in the developing world: agriculture. Globally, it’s the biggest employer, the biggest user of water—which is a really constrained resource in many poor countries—and one of the biggest users of electricity. My group is making solar-powered desalination systems that can function off the grid and desalinate brackish groundwater, because in India so much of the land has salty water in the ground. We’re working to make electrical grids hardier and the desalination process more energy efficient. We’re also working on low-cost, solar-powered drip irrigation systems that can enable farmers to grow more and higher value crops to rise out of poverty while minimizing water waste.

Responding to the global refugee crisis,"More than 59 million people globally are classified by the United Nations as &ldquo;forcibly displaced,&rdquo; the highest number since the Second World War.",2016-04-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/refugee%20crisis/blog_hero_1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/responding-to-the-global-refugee-crisis,"Responding to the global refugee crisis A McKinsey team, along with Bridge International Academies and non-profits Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Vitol Foundation , is developing a curriculum for  robust, low-cost tablets to help educate refugee children. April 6, 2016 More than 59 million people globally are classified by the United Nations as “forcibly displaced,” the highest number since the Second World War. The conflict in Syria alone has displaced at least 11 million people, around 4 million of whom have taken refuge outside the country. We’re working behind the scenes to support the responses of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and not for profits in many parts of the world. “This mass movement of people is more than a passing news story—it’s a global phenomenon that will have lasting effects,” says Khaled Rifai, a German-born, New York-based partner with Syrian roots, who is coordinating our work on refugee projects. When the scale of the crisis in Syria started to become clear, Markus Gstöttner, a consultant based in our London office, started looking for ways McKinsey could help. He recalls, “After several visits to the region and extensive research, it became clear that providing education for refugee children was an issue where our strengths as an institution overlapped with needs on the ground.” Today he leads a team of McKinsey volunteers on a project to deliver schooling to some of the 500,000 Syrian children who are refugees in neighboring Lebanon. The team, which includes Syrian and Lebanese colleagues, is working in partnership with education provider Bridge International Academies , local not for profit Basmeh & Zeitooneh , and Vitol Foundation , the nonprofit arm of the Dutch energy company. Working together, the group has developed a tailored curriculum that can be delivered to students by teachers using robust, low-cost tablets. “Faced with this number of children, there simply aren’t enough teachers available to deliver conventional schooling,” says Markus. “The Bridge platform can be used by volunteers who wouldn’t otherwise be able to teach. It provides structure and content right down to the level of scripts for individual lessons.” The model has been piloted with refugee children living on the outskirts of Beirut, and the team hopes to reach around 1,500 primary-school-age children directly by the end of this year. The curriculum is open source, enabling other organizations to use it to deliver education programs across Lebanon and eventually in other countries too. No less important, we’ve been working with the United Nations Development Programme, the UK government, and others to stimulate economic development in the region. In January, at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, we chaired a meeting of global business leaders hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Queen Rania of Jordan. Our work paved the way for a donor conference in February in London which resulted in monetary pledges of over $10 billion—the largest sum ever pledged on a single day. Of course the impact of the Syrian crisis is being felt outside the region too. European countries are struggling to deal with hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking asylum from war or opportunities for a more prosperous life. McKinsey teams are working with federal and regional government agencies to strengthen their capacity to respond. In the words of Kalle Bengtsson, a Stockholm-based partner who leads our Public Sector Practice in Western Europe, “Our mission is to serve our clients on their most challenging problems. For many European governments right now there is no bigger issue than balancing urgent humanitarian needs with the need to integrate refugees and migrants into society.” Never miss a story","McKinsey, in collaboration with Bridge International Academies and nonprofits, is developing a low-cost tablet curriculum to educate refugee children, particularly focusing on 500,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon.
