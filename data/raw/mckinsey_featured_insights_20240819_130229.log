Though loosening somewhat since their 2022 peaks, labor markets in advanced economies remain tighter than at any other time over the past two decades. This is not a pandemic-induced phenomenon. Rather, it continues a long-term trend that started in 2010, when advanced economies began their protracted recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Shifting demographic forces could intensify this trend in the future. As workforces age and population growth decelerates, countries cannot count on excess workers to power economic growth. Absent concerted efforts to boost productivity or increases in the workforce through higher participation or immigration, many advanced economies will struggle to exceed—or even match—the relatively muted economic growth of the past decade. So far, the impact of the labor market squeeze has been unevenly distributed. Job vacancies have climbed most steeply in sectors that traditionally have low productivity, such as healthcare and hospitality, as well as those with stagnant productivity, like construction. Without action, labor shortages may continue to hit sectors that struggle to increase productivity. Tight job markets present both challenges and opportunities. Job seekers find work more easily and may garner higher wages. Yet upward wage pressure can spur inflation and stress businesses, particularly smaller ones. For instance, companies may need to turn down orders because they can’t hire enough workers to satisfy demand. At the economy level, we estimate that GDP in 2023 could have been 0.5 to 1.5 percent higher in the biggest advanced economies if employers had been able to fill their job vacancies. Businesses large and small will need strategies to confront persistent labor shortages. Deploying and adopting technologies is one way they can power productivity growth. Retraining programs can help workers gain new skills needed as technologies shift, and matching programs can pair people with jobs. Businesses also can expand their hiring pools, including by seeking to attract immigrants and people who might otherwise sit on the sidelines. Against this backdrop, this article examines labor markets in advanced economies, using 20 charts to illustrate conditions in labor markets today, future prospects, and actions to address shortages. These labor markets range across 30 economies in Asia, Europe, and North America, with a particular focus on the eight largest: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Tightness is the trend Today’s tight labor markets reflect longer-term trends in vacancy and unemployment rates across advanced economies. Since 2010, labor markets have tightened across all 30 advanced economies we analyzed. 1 The 30 countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Comparing job vacancies with numbers of unemployed job seekers provides one measure of labor market tightness. The number of job vacancies per unemployed person increased by more than four times on average across these economies between 2010 and 2023, and by almost seven times in the United States. Labor shortages have appeared across a diverse group of countries that have no apparent common features other than their stage of development. Tightness is particularly acute in seven countries—the Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, and the United States—that have more vacancies than unemployed workers. Together these countries account for 53 percent of the total labor supply of the 30 advanced economies in our research, and 64 percent of collective GDP. In another seven countries, the number of job vacancies is 0.5 to 1.0 times the number of unemployed workers. Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom are in this group. But not all large economies have labor shortages. For example, labor markets in France and Italy remain relatively slack, as they do in 14 other countries among the 30. This group collectively accounts for 31 percent of total labor supply and 20 percent of total GDP. Yet even in most of these places, labor markets have tightened. Vacancies per unemployed person have increased by five times in Italy and by almost four times in France. The tightening trend began after the 2008 financial crisis, when job vacancies were dwarfed by a vast number of unemployed people. The recovery was slow: labor markets in these 30 economies took 8.2 years on average to reach the degree of tightness they had before the crisis. The desire to hire carried on apace, and labor markets continued to tighten until the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in early 2020. During the pandemic, many labor markets oscillated, first to extreme looseness and then to extreme tightness. Generous fiscal stimulus measures during the crisis fueled a comparatively fast job recovery, and by 2022, labor markets had achieved the highest ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people in two decades. Today, labor markets remain historically tight but have cooled somewhat from that peak. For instance, as of April 2024, the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio in the United States had dropped to 1.2 from 1.4 at the end of the prior year. The devil is in the details: Decoding the labor data In the internet era, posting job listings is easy and motivation to take them down is low, raising questions about the reliability of data on job openings. 1 “Measuring job openings in the U.S. labor market,” Congressional Research Service, February 28, 2024. In this research, we examined trends in labor market tightness using a variety of data that economists typically employ to understand labor market dynamics, drawing data from multilateral and country statistical agencies. These included the following: We focus on measuring labor market tightness as the ratio of vacancy rates to unemployment rates, but our conclusions hold if we examine unemployment rates only (exhibit). In 2023 in all countries but Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden, the unemployment rate was lower than the median observed since 2000, and the average unemployment rate across 30 advanced economies was among the lowest one-fifth of unemployment rates observed since 2000. To explore the micro underpinnings of labor shortages, we analyzed vacancy and employment data at the sector level in seven of the eight focus countries. (We were unable to extract the same data for Japan.) Additionally, we combined US occupational data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics with McKinsey Global Institute’s skills taxonomy to understand the types of jobs and workers most affected by the labor shortage. We also tested whether labor market tightness was a result of mismatches between workers and available jobs. This happens when vacancy rates rise without a commensurate decline in unemployment rates or vice versa. While we found evidence of such mismatches in Australia, Canada, and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, by the end of 2022 they were resolving, and so that analysis is absent from this report. 2 This can be seen on the Beveridge curve, which illustrates the relationship between unemployment rates and job opening rates. For an example, see The Beveridge curve (job openings rate vs. unemployment rate), seasonally adjusted , US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed May 20, 2024; Gadi Barlevy et al., The shifting reasons for Beveridge-curve shifts , IZA discussion paper number 16517, IZA Institute of Labor Economics, October 2023. Across the eight focus economies, labor markets have retreated from peak tightness during the COVID-19 pandemic toward conditions more similar to the rising prepandemic trend. Only Italy, which had one of the loosest labor markets among developed economies before the pandemic, shows no signs of declining tightness yet. This could be the result of the Italian government’s fiscal response to COVID-19, which the International Monetary Fund estimates exceeded 45 percent of the country’s GDP, making it the most generous relief package among advanced economies. 2 Database of Fiscal Policy Responses to COVID-19, International Monetary Fund, accessed May 28, 2023. Japan, where the labor market was among the tightest before the pandemic, lags its prepandemic trend, in part because a weakening yen increased costs in the import-dependent economy. Nonetheless, job vacancies remain 1.2 times the number of job seekers. Image description: Eight line charts, 1 for each of the highlighted countries, plot the same data from the previous exhibit, job vacancies per unemployed person, from 2015 to 2023. The lines mostly rise from left to right, with a sudden plunge and recovering rise over the initial pandemic years of 2020–21. Each graph includes a second line that starts in 2019 and rises steadily upward to the right, plotting the continuation of each country’s 2015–19 trend. The first lines plotting the actual post-2019 data mostly show a return to the trend illustrated by the second set of lines. End of image description Overall, the appetite to hire continues along a rising trend line, outpacing the number of workers seeking jobs. Increased labor input drove economic growth in many countries What was behind the robust appetite for labor? Since 2010, countries that have increased GDP fastest have done so primarily by adding more workers rather than by improving productivity. In markets such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, where labor has been relatively plentiful and consequently easier to hire, companies had a business rationale to add hours and employment rather than tackling the harder job of improving productivity. Countries where labor wasn’t so plentiful—Germany and Japan, for example—relied more on productivity growth to propel their economies, although that did not fully compensate for low labor force growth. In fact, labor productivity has stagnated in many advanced economies, as documented in previous McKinsey Global Institute reports. 1 For more, see Investing in productivity growth , McKinsey Global Institute, March 2024, and Rekindling US productivity for a new era , McKinsey Global Institute, February 2023. Even though all countries experienced a productivity slowdown after the financial crisis, some countries were more negatively affected than others. In Australia, productivity benefited from a commodity boom, while in the United Kingdom, underinvestment in regions other than the southeast may have exacerbated stagnating productivity. 2 Angelina Bruno, Jessica Dunphy, and Fiona Georgiakakis, Recent trends in Australian productivity , Reserve Bank of Australia, September 2023; Productivity in the UK: Evidence review , UK Productivity Commission, National Institute of Economic and Social Research, June 2022. The excess supply of labor has dwindled In the wake of the financial crisis, many people struggled to find work. In 2010, there were roughly 24 million excess workers, as measured by comparing the number of job seekers with the number of job openings across the eight countries. Today the number of job seekers is close to the number of job vacancies. However, the degree of excess supply (or no excess supply at all, in some cases) varies at the country level. Labor demand exceeded supply in Germany, Japan, and the United States at the end of 2023. Recently, Germany enacted a law aimed at increasing immigration of highly skilled workers, and in the United States efforts are under way to establish a federal commission to study labor shortages and find ways to address them. The excess supply of unemployed workers relative to job openings in France and Italy was two million and one million, respectively. While these economies have meaningful slack in their labor markets today, even they have tightened. Their excess labor figures are 7.1 and 5.7 percent, respectively, down from prepandemic peaks well above 10 percent. The factors that drove labor market tightness also varied across countries. Unemployment rates in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States came down from highs in 2010, while Australia never had very high unemployment. Italy continued to have a relatively high rate of unemployment but also increased vacancies, suggesting either a mismatch or a higher natural rate of unemployment. Meanwhile, demand increased markedly in Japan while its shrinking population constrained its labor supply. Image description: Nine area charts, 1 for each of the highlighted countries plus an 8-country aggregate chart, show mostly positive but descending values with some small dips into negative territory in 4 of the charts. The vertical axes show surplus workers in relation to labor demand, going from -4% at the bottom to 15% at the top for the individual country charts and from –5 million to 25 million workers for the aggregate chart. The countries’ horizontal axes show years from 2000 on the left to 2023 on the right. The aggregate chart begins at 2010, starting at about 24 million at the top left and shrinking to 1 million on the right in 2023. The country charts all end in 2023 between –1.5% and 7.1% of demand, each value lower than where the plot started. End of image description The labor surplus has fallen from 24 million to 1 million since 2010 in eight advanced economies The number of excess workers dwindled as growth in labor demand outpaced growth in labor supply. Labor forces in these eight countries grew between 2010 and 2023. Propelled by population growth and increased labor force participation that outweighed the impact of aging, 33 million workers in total joined their labor forces. Over the same period, labor demand grew strongly, fueled by expansive monetary and fiscal policies as these countries recovered from the financial crisis. Employers needed to fill some 57 million additional jobs over the same period, or 24 million more than the number of available workers. Most advanced economies avoided subsequent downturns. This uninterrupted growth in demand not only drove average unemployment down from 8 percent to 4 percent but also created an additional ten million unfilled jobs across the eight economies. During that time, people worked fewer hours on average, but the imbalance between job seekers and available jobs wasn’t due to that change. From 2010 to 2023, the average number of hours worked per employee fell from 37 to 36, a 3 percent decline roughly equivalent to just 33,000 workers in 2023. Declining working hours affect labor supply and labor demand equally, meaning the net effect is negligible. Countries today have fewer than one million excess workers in aggregate: the number of job seekers is close to the number of job vacancies. What appears to be a perfectly matched labor market is in reality an extremely tight one, since some degree of excess supply is always the norm—matching is never perfect, and demand and supply are always in flux as workers switch jobs and employers shift strategies. GDP could have been higher by 0.5 to 1.5 percent in 2023 if excess vacancies had been fewer Increased job vacancies can constrain real economic output; they represent demand for goods and services that businesses are unable to fulfill. In seven of the eight countries—Japan is the exception—unfilled job vacancies in 2023 were higher than in 2019, before the onset of COVID-19, when they were in turn higher than their median levels from 2010 to 2019. Unmet demand for labor can be addressed by finding additional new workers or by raising the productivity of existing workers. This can restore balance to labor supply and demand while creating additional output. We estimate the additional output that would have been produced if labor markets were not so tight by examining the degree to which vacancy rates are higher than a structural or natural rate of vacancies. Structural vacancy rates vary across industries and countries and can even vary over time. To account for this, we compared sector-level vacancy rates in 2023 to vacancy rates in 2019 as well as to the median rate from 2010 to 2019. We find that, depending on the country, GDP could have been 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent higher in 2023 if that unmet labor demand had been filled. 1 To estimate how much GDP might have been generated absent increased labor market tightness, we determined how many additional workers would be employed if 2023 job vacancy rates by sector fell to their historical level in 2019, or to their median vacancy rate level from 2010 to 2019, in each country. The output was estimated based on that number of workers and the average productivity per worker, at 2023 levels, for each sector. It is sensitive to the productivity assumption; we assume average productivity, but the potential productivity of unfilled vacancies could be lower than the sector average. Who’s feeling the crunch? Employers in some sectors have felt the impact of the labor shortage more than others, and the appetite for physical and manual skills has unexpectedly intensified. All sectors have higher job vacancy rates today than in 2010 Across economies, average vacancy rates, or job vacancies as a share of total labor demand, increased by more than two percentage points from 2010 to 2023 in the healthcare, leisure and hospitality, and construction sectors. 1 Includes seven of the eight focus countries. This data was not available for Japan. Conversely, job vacancy rates in the financial and real estate sector and the information sector, both high-productivity sectors with well-paid jobs, changed by less than one percentage point on average. The pandemic hit the leisure and hospitality sector particularly hard as travel and tourism slowed. As restaurants and hotels reopened, they struggled to restaff. In Europe, some hotels hired people with little or no experience, and fast-food restaurants in the United States raised wages and shortened hours to cope with a shortage of staff. 2 Ryan Mann, Esteban Ramirez, and Matthew Straus, “ Three innovations to solve hotel staffing shortages ,” McKinsey, April 2023; Carol Kahn, “Sedona hotels cope with staffing shortages,” Sedona Red Rock News , October 29, 2021; Andrew Mills, Corina Pons, and Catarina Demony, “No experience, no resume, you’re hired! Hotels fight for staff,” Reuters, July 4, 2022; Joanna Fantozzi, “Restaurants are still dramatically decreasing their hours, new study shows,” Nation’s Restaurant News , October 28, 2022. Aggregate employment levels indicate that previous restaurant and hotel workers have rejoined the workforce, but they appear to have taken jobs in other sectors. The healthcare sector has been strained as aging populations have driven demand for these services. The sector had the highest number of job vacancies among the sectors in our research, or 16.9 percent of all vacancies in 2023. Vacancy rates also markedly increased in the construction sector, in part due to its cyclicality. Demand in the sector began climbing in 2010 after dropping sharply during the financial crisis. Today, strong demand for housing and government spending on large infrastructure projects, such as a €45 billion construction relief package in Germany and a $1.2 trillion package for infrastructure in the United States, have propelled vacancies. Vacancies have not grown in lockstep with employment Sectors fall into four groups depending on how vacancies grew in relation to employment: “labor hungry,” “labor attracting,” “labor disrupting,” and “labor efficient”. Labor shortages have had the biggest impact on labor-hungry sectors, such as healthcare and construction, as previously noted. Demand for labor has risen faster than the sector’s ability to attract workers. Vacancies have increased in public and private healthcare systems despite efforts in countries such as the United Kingdom to attract immigrants to the sector, and construction is booming in most advanced economies due to housing shortages and infrastructure needs. Typically less capital intensive and more difficult to automate, these sectors added jobs at or faster than the average clip but not fast enough to keep pace with demand. In Canada, for instance, a recent House of Commons committee report acknowledged that the country has “longstanding issues with lack of supply of health professionals,” in part due to mental health issues and burnout exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which have led to retention issues. 1 Sean Casey, Addressing Canada’s healthcare workforce crisis , Report of the Standing Committee on Health, House of Commons, Canada, March 2023. And some Italian construction companies are turning to workforce development programs and partnerships with African universities to recruit and train new workers. 2 “Webuild CEO Pietro Salini: Ready to hire about 10,000 people in next three years to develop infrastructure in Italy,” Webuild Group, September 18, 2023. Conversely, labor-attracting sectors like financial and real estate, information, and professional services have also added employment faster than average—they have attracted workers at a faster pace than their demand for labor has grown. In this group, only the professional services sector increased its share of overall vacancies. Manufacturing is a labor-disrupting sector. Although the sector accounted for a smaller part of the workforce in 2023 than in 2010 across the eight countries, its job vacancies nonetheless increased significantly, especially after 2019. Research by economist Richard Baldwin found that since 2013, the manufacturing sector has lost 20 million jobs globally due to productivity gains from increasing automation. 3 Richard Baldwin, “Where in the world are manufacturing jobs going?” Factful Friday with Richard Baldwin, LinkedIn, December 22, 2023. The mix of workforce skills has been changing, as some manufacturing jobs require more customer relations or analytics, and as corporate manufacturing footprints are themselves changing. For example, areas such as semiconductors and electric vehicle manufacturing are demanding more workers as a result of shifts in industrial policy and “friendshoring.” Trade is a labor-efficient sector, in which productivity enhancements have eased the pressure to hire. As consumer demand has shifted, the retail segment of the trade sector has increasingly automated and digitized, increasing productivity and mitigating the impact of labor shortages. In Japan, for example, convenience stores are responding to staff shortages not only by relying on immigrant labor but also by rolling out technology like self-checkout and cleaning robots. 4 For immigrant labor, see “For a glimpse of Japan’s future, see its convenience stores,” Economist , April 4, 2024. For automation, see “Promotion of digitization to improve convenience,” FamilyMart, accessed May 20, 2024. For cleaning robots, see Fumika Nakashima, “Japan’s FamilyMart to roll out cleaning robots at 300 convenience stores,” Nikkei Asia, February 13, 2024.

The horizontal axis shows the 2010–23 change in employment share, going from –5 points on the left to 5 on the right. The 5 labor-hungry sectors described in the text are in the top-middle of the plot, with almost all positive values. The 3 labor-attracting sectors are in the right-middle, with increasing employment share and mostly decreasing vacancy share. The one labor-disrupting sector, manufacturing, is in the middle-left, with decreasing employment share. And the one labor-efficient sector, trade, is in the bottom left, with shares all decreasing. End of image description Sectors struggling with productivity contributed disproportionately to vacancy growth What explains the differences between the shifting employment share and the shifting share of vacancies? Productivity and productivity growth are crucial factors: sectors with lower productivity and productivity growth had steeper increases in vacancy share. In a growing economy with a tight labor market, low-productivity sectors requiring the most labor per unit of additional output are likely to be most constrained. Opportunities exist to boost productivity across sectors. The leisure and hospitality sector in the United States provides a case study. In 2021, the sector accounted for 16 percent of all job vacancies, a comparatively big share that was three percentage points higher than its average from 2010 to 2020. The sector responded to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by automating more processes and raising wages by an average of 29 percent from mid-2019 to mid-2023. Those steps increased the sector’s productivity by 6.4 percent over that period, decreasing pressure to hire and reducing its share of vacancies as its vacancy rate fell to 6 percent in 2023 from a decade high of 11 percent in 2021. Spotlight: Physical and manual skills in demand Demand for skill types is another lens through which the impact of a labor shortage can be examined. Our skills taxonomy comprises five broad categories—technological, social and emotional, higher cognitive, basic cognitive, and physical and manual skills, mapped to detailed occupations. 1 See A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyond , McKinsey Global Institute, May 2024. Here we analyze skills to understand increased job vacancies in the United States. While some conclusions could be extrapolated to other peer countries, they may not be universally true. In an era of technological change, the most significant absolute shortage is in technological skills. Occupations relying on these skills, like software developers and other IT-related jobs, have been the hardest to fill since 2015, although the advent of generative AI may restore some balance. The changing skill mix within occupations has already shown up in the United Kingdom in increased references to the need for technological skills in occupational postings. 2 Rui Costa et al., “Old skills, new skills—what is changing in the UK labour market” The Pissarides Review into the Future of Work and Wellbeing , Institute for the Future of Work, February 2024. However, a shortage of physical and manual skills has likely exacerbated recent labor market tightness. Jobs requiring these skills had the lowest vacancy rate among the five broad skill categories, and job vacancies seeking these skills increased most since 2015. This reflects growing demand for manufacturing and repair workers as well as for some types of healthcare workers, like nursing assistants. For instance, Delaware has begun offering tuition assistance and other incentives to attract workers to study nursing in an effort to address a shortage of trained nurses. 3 See Johnny Perez-Gonzalez, “Delaware responds to nursing shortage with ‘Tuition Incentive Program,’” WHYY, December 13, 2023. The occupations with the biggest increase in share of vacancies are associated with labor-hungry sectors such as food service, healthcare, and construction. Workers in these occupations mostly use physical and manual skills, which in many cases are challenging to automate and, in the case of healthcare occupations, likely to face unabated increases in demand as populations age. Workers in occupations in which the share of vacancies declined most, by contrast, use physical and manual skills for only a small part of their work. Instead, these occupations, which include management, sales, financial operations and computing, rely most heavily on social and emotional skills. Across all sectors, such occupations are often more highly paid; in some cases, they are likely to be a shrinking slice of the total workforce. Office support occupations could shrink as basic cognitive skills are increasingly automated, while sales is already a shrinking occupational category as e-commerce becomes a bigger part of retail trade and technological changes shift marketing dollars to other channels and assets. 1 Michael Riely, Inside the decline of sales occupations , US Bureau of Labor Statistics Beyond the Numbers series, May 2020. Research by McKinsey has found that generative AI might accelerate the trend of automation in both of these occupational categories. 2 See The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier , McKinsey Global Institute, June 2023. Jobs requiring a high proportion of physical and manual skills often have lower wages. In tight labor markets, wage dynamics shift based on workers’ changing opportunity costs, including options to move into higher-paying jobs. As US labor markets tightened, wages grew across the board, especially among workers in the lowest-paying occupations, and the biggest beneficiaries were workers who switched jobs. 1 David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew, The unexpected compression: Competition at work in the low wage labor market , National Bureau of Economic Research working paper number 31010, November 2023. Given that the labor share of production is about 60 percent across advanced economies, rising labor costs are highly relevant for employers and policy makers. 2 Based on data through 2013 for Germany, Japan, and the United States. See Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman, The global decline of the labor share , National Bureau of Economic Research working paper number 19136, June 2013. Grouping US occupations based on average salaries, the occupations in the bottom half of the income range require physical and manual skills more than 40 percent of the time. Those lower-paying occupations in the third and fourth quartiles by income had the fastest wage growth from 2015 to 2022. The top half of occupations by income require physical and manual skills much less, and just 5 percent of the time among the top quartile of occupations by pay. Growing the supply-side pie Labor supply has struggled to keep up with overall demand due to shifts in demographics—and that’s unlikely to change, according to projections to 2030. Higher participation rates mitigated the impact of aging on labor supply Even as labor markets have tightened, labor supply has grown. From 2010 to 2023, 34 million additional people joined the workforces across the eight countries, an average growth rate of 0.6 percent a year. The first factor influencing this growth is the expansion of population, both from so-called natural growth, or the net of new births and deaths, and from immigration. The second factor is linked to an aging mix of workers and had the opposite impact, pushing supply lower. The third factor is increased participation in the labor force, which helps mitigate the impact of aging. The independent contribution of each of these three factors is clear. Had population alone grown, it would have accounted for 31 million of the 34 million added workers. Aging alone would have led to 18 million fewer workers as more seniors dropped out of the labor force. However, at the same time, labor force participation has increased, particularly among workers 55 years and older. The combined effects of these three factors net to 34 million additional workers. The dynamics of these three factors varied greatly by country. Labor supply grew fastest in Australia and Canada, driven by strong population growth. Population growth also drove increased labor supply in the United Kingdom and the United States, though more moderately than in Australia and Canada. Germany’s labor supply growth was due largely to increased participation rates, while France’s growth came from both population growth and more participation. In Japan and Italy, the impact of aging has been much more pronounced than in other countries, although for now increased participation has allowed for continued modest labor force growth. Population growth slowed, despite being buoyed by immigration A major challenge to labor force growth in the future is that the population growth rate has slowed in all eight countries since 2010 and is projected to continue to decline. In fact, populations in Japan and Italy are shrinking, and, according to United Nations estimates, the German population will begin to shrink by 2030. Falling birth rates in many advanced economies largely explain their slower population growth. In some countries, immigration has also declined, exacerbating the trend. Immigration could have compensated for natural population decline, or when deaths exceed births, since 2015—if it had been roughly 1.5 to 3.0 times higher than current levels in Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In France, Italy, and Japan, it would have needed to be even higher. Immigration enables short-term labor supply growth. By contrast, it takes perhaps 20 years for natural increase in a population to affect the labor market, because a baby born today cannot meaningfully work for roughly 20 years. Many immigrants are of working age and so can participate in the labor force today. 1 “Foreign-born workers: Labor force characteristics—2023,” US Bureau of Labor Statistics press release, May 21, 2024. For instance, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the US labor force in 2033 will be larger by 5.2 million people, mostly because of higher net immigration. 2 Phillip L. Swagel, Director’s statement on the budget and economic outlook for 2024 to 2034 , Congressional Budget Office, February 2024. Research by the Brookings Institution suggests that an unexpectedly high level of net immigration explains the recent fast pace of added employment in the United States. 3 Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson, New immigration estimates help make sense of the pace of employment , Brookings Institution, March 2024. Older workers are an increasing share of populations Beyond their slowing population growth, all the countries in our sample are aging, a trend that will intensify as members of the baby boom generation become older. This creates an obstacle to labor force growth because older people often work at much lower rates, especially past the age of 65. The proportion of the working-age population, or people over 15 years old, that is 55 years and older increased from 2010 to 2023, and the United Nations projects that that share will grow even more by 2030. At that time, about half of the working-age populations of Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom will be older than 55, and almost one-third will be older than 65. Populations are younger in Australia, Canada, and the United States, where by 2030 roughly two-fifths of the working-age populations will be older than 55. As countries aged overall, labor force participation among older cohorts of the working-age population increased. Older workers fueled growth in the labor supply Even as aging populations pose a potential drag on labor force growth, people have been working more at almost every stage of life in all eight countries. (The exceptions are 15- to 24-year-olds in Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom, who are working less; similarly, 25- to 54-year-olds in France are working slightly less.)  For example, in the United States, shifts in the overall age mix pushed the aggregate labor force participation rate lower from 2010 to 2023, yet the participation rate grew, albeit marginally, in every age cohort over the period. Everywhere, older people are working longer. The largest increases in labor force participation have been among those 55 years and older (with the notable exception of the United States, where work in that cohort increased only modestly). From 2010 to 2023, participation among this cohort grew 23 percentage points in Italy, 15 points in Germany and France, and 12 points in Japan. This increase in participation rates reflected shifting pension policies and attitudes toward retirement. For instance, Italy switched to a defined-contribution retirement system and increased its retirement age in 2011. 1 Margherita Borella and Flavia Coda Moscarola, The 2011 pension reform in Italy and its effects on current and future retirees , working paper number 151/15, Center for Research on Pensions and Welfare Policies, September 2015. And long before the COVID-19 pandemic put labor market tightness onto the global radar, Japanese companies struggling to find workers in an aging society were tapping the country’s Silver Jinzai Centers. These community centers for older people traditionally found retirees to help maintain parks or manage parking lots, but more recently, a wide variety of Japanese corporations are enlisting them to find workers for jobs they can’t otherwise fill. 2 Ippei Hoshi, Shinichiro Yamaguchi, and Nobuaki Takada, Changes in elderly employment: New roles of “Silver” Human Resources Centers , Nomura Research Institute, March 2017; Daisuke J. Nakajima and Jeffrey D. Korzenik, “How America can bring the Japanese economic miracle stateside,” Wall Street Journal , June 5, 2023. The shaded bars in the accompanying exhibit illustrate how labor force participation rates might grow if trends in participation rates for each age cohort continue to 2030 in line with the trend set from 2012 to 2023. In the United States, labor force participation rates didn’t change much over that period, but in countries like Italy and Japan, where participation rates have shifted markedly, achieving the past trend could yield significant increases in labor force participation rates. Spotlight: Increasing female labor force participation boosted labor supply One component of rising participation rates is the narrowing gender gap. We compared the ratio of female and male labor force participation rates and average hours worked per week to approximate the gender gap in the workforces of our focus countries. We found the gender gap has been shrinking since 2010, more significantly in labor force participation than in hours. About 60 percent of the workers who joined the labor force from 2010 to 2023 were women. In Italy, Japan, and Germany, the narrowing gender gap is due entirely to women participating in the labor force more. In other countries, the ratio climbed as women increased their labor force participation while participation among men declined, by as much as three percentage points in some places. Currently more women work part-time than men, likely due to different responsibilities in the household. Improving labor force participation among women may therefore be encouraged by flexible working arrangements and access to care support. For example, Japan has made progress on its gender gap in part through a set of policies called Womenomics that include providing daycare support and tax incentives to encourage married women to join the labor market. 1 “Japan introduces ‘womenomics’ to counter the country’s aging workforce and boost GDP,” Council on Foreign Relations, accessed May 20, 2024. Such interventions could increase the contribution of women to labor supply growth and reduce tightness in the labor market. Labor supply growth is expected to slow further Looking ahead, we examined two possible scenarios for labor force participation rates in 2030. In both cases, labor force growth slows. In the stable scenario, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan may have smaller labor supplies by 2030. In fact, even if labor participation rates continue to grow at the same rate as in the past in Germany, Italy, and Japan, their labor forces won’t increase. By contrast, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States are likely to see increases in labor supply under either scenario, although at a slower pace than over the past 13 years, due to stronger expected rates of immigration. Gearing up for continued tightness Given shifting demographics, advanced economies will need to find ways to grow labor supply and increase productivity in order to maintain their current level of economic growth, and employers and policy makers can help by taking action. To maintain GDP growth, all countries need additional labor supplies or productivity growth—and some need both We quantify four scenarios of economic growth using two alternative rates of productivity growth along with our two possible scenarios of future labor force participation rates. For each economic growth scenario, we assume adequate demand for labor—in other words, that no recession occurs that would curb employment. This assumption may be reasonable in the short term, though recessions are notoriously hard to predict. The United States has so far navigated an economic soft landing, but any economic downturn could crimp job demand. Meanwhile, Germany and Japan have experienced only tepid demand growth, calling into question the underlying strength of demand in those countries. By contrast, new technologies offer the potential for more robust productivity growth that could dispel some of those concerns. Our two productivity growth scenarios include a higher estimate that uses average productivity growth from 1999 to 2007, a period of robust productivity growth before the financial crisis, and a lower estimate that uses productivity growth from 2012 to 2022. These scenarios suggest that, absent productivity acceleration or growth in labor force participation rates, GDP will increase at a slower pace than the 2012 to 2022 trend in the eight countries. If labor force participation continues to grow or there is an increase in productivity back to pre-2007 levels in Australia and Japan, the countries would maintain their 2012–22 trend of GDP growth. Four of the six other countries—Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States—would need productivity to return to pre-2007 levels in order to maintain their economic growth. Continued growth of the labor force participation rate is relatively less important to maintaining economic growth for these countries. Germany would need continued labor force participation rate growth and a return to pre-2007 levels of productivity to maintain its level of economic growth. By constrast, even if Italy continued its high rate of growth in labor force participation, it would still need to increase productivity growth by an additional 0.1 percent each year above its 0.4 percent pre-2007 annual productivity growth. All of these countries have the potential to reach a higher level of productivity growth in the future. Previous MGI research documents the promise of technologies like artificial intelligence, which has the potential to deliver more than enough added productivity to keep their economies growing even in a future with a declining labor supply. To be sure, the path to realize that opportunity is far from certain. Implementing any new technology requires complicated adaptation of business processes and extensive retraining of workforces. However, employed correctly, these tools offer a way forward to economic prosperity despite labor supply constraints. These projections are not predictions of the future, but they do illustrate the demographic constraints on economies over the next decade, casting a cloud on the prospects of durably resolving labor shortages. For economies to maintain stability or grow, they will need to go beyond business as usual to boost productivity or find additional workers in new ways. Concerted actions can improve labor supply and productivity and better match people to jobs. All labor market stakeholders—employers, market influencers, policy makers, training institutions, and other workforce development organizations—can address labor shortages. Each can act by improving supply, productivity, or matching. Action employers can take include the following: Policy makers and other market-making participants can take the following steps to address tight markets: Acknowledgments This research was led by Anu Madgavkar , a McKinsey Global Institute partner in New Jersey; Olivia White , a McKinsey senior partner and director of MGI based in San Francisco; Sven Smit , a McKinsey senior partner and chair of MGI based in Amsterdam; Chris Bradley , a McKinsey senior partner and director of MGI based in Sydney; and Ryan Luby , a senior knowledge expert and associate partner based in New York.

In our second segment, McKinsey senior partner Tania Holt explores the challenge that Europe faces in filling many open skilled labor jobs. The answer, says Holt, is hiring ethnic-minority employees. This transcript has been edited for clarity and length. The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Lucia Rahilly and Roberta Fusaro. The ABCs of productivity Roberta Fusaro: We’re here to talk about the latest McKinsey Global Institute [MGI] report on productivity . 1 “ Investing in productivity growth ,” McKinsey Global Institute, March 27, 2024. McKinsey has taken a longitudinal look at global labor productivity going back 25 years. We’re going to get into the specifics, but I did want to step back for a moment and just define our terms. What does productivity measure and why is it so important? Chris Bradley: It’s a very simple measure but it has a lot of complexity. The measure of productivity is how much output, how much GDP, is generated for every hour of work. And that matters, because over the long run it reflects two things. First, it reflects how good we are as an economy at doing stuff. Second, it’s the main way by which all of the technical progress of the world, all of the capital accumulation, has found its way into the main way that we share our wealth, which is through wages. Olivia White: Different ways to think about this are lattes pulled in an hour or in a minute; or cars that move down an assembly line in any given period.   It matters a ton because this is the only way that we can raise wages and living standards for people in a country or across the world. Roberta Fusaro: What’s the big-picture view of productivity? Chris Bradley: The answer is really interesting. The first thing that happened was that we had an absolute productivity miracle. Globally, median country productivity is now six times more productive than it was 25 years ago. Olivia White: And in terms of dollars, in 1997, labor productivity measured in terms of output per worker per year was about $7,000. In 2022, that number was $41,000. The world has grown much more productive and, as a result, at large, much richer. Chris Bradley: But, equally, it’s a slowing miracle. In other words, while we have improved productivity over this time period, the rate at which we’re currently  improving productivity is slowing just about everywhere. The fast lane is going slower, and the advanced economies are going slower as well. Want to subscribe to The McKinsey Podcast ? Understanding inconsistencies in productivity Roberta Fusaro: Olivia, the report uses a highway as analogy. Can you describe what the report means by different lanes with different speeds? Olivia White: Emerging economies are on  a highway with fast and slow lanes, with immensely diverging speeds between different lanes. So for a fast-lane economy such as Poland, if it kept up the pace of productivity growth it’s had over the past 25 years, it would reach US productivity levels within the next 11 years. And China would be there in about 15 to 16 years. By contrast, for a country like Indonesia, which has been in the middle lane, it would take 135 years. And for countries in the slow lane, such as Argentina, at its pace of productivity growth over the past 25 years, it would never catch up. This is a highway where some economies are effectively going in reverse compared with advanced economies. Why does it matter? About half the world’s population consumes over 50 gigajoules of energy a year. This energy consumption powers productivity and is enabled as a country gets richer. Chris Bradley: Now, in the middle lane are places like Thailand, Egypt, Tanzania, where their productivity growth is not as fast as it should be given their starting point. Remember, if you start with low capital, the incremental returns on capital should be very, very high, and you should be experiencing much higher productivity growth. It’s natural. But in this case, we didn’t see as much growth in these countries as we expected. If you start with low capital, the incremental returns on capital should be very, very high, and you should be experiencing much higher productivity growth. This creates a Sherlock Holmes mystery of what’s going on? In the slow lane, we find parts of the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. These places live in a productivity shadow. This is one of the great tasks of the world: to move these economies into the fast lane. One of the things we talk about in our report is a five-part formula of what it takes to get into the fast lane. We need to ask how do we get these billions of people in the slow lane who aren’t converging and move them  into the fast lane? Roberta Fusaro: What are some of the contributing factors to stalling productivity? Chris Bradley: Let’s divide it into two sections. That’s one thing we did a lot in our report. We made sure we were looking at countries corrected for their context. And the most important context is where you start. This means if you’ve got a very basic economy where very few people live in cities and you have very little capital, the first tractor, the first freeway, the first skyscraper has a massive impact on productivity. But the millionth one, less so. The first reason for this is good news, which is places like China and India made a big leap forward and caught up a lot. They haven’t caught up all the way, but as those economies get closer to a fully industrialized economy, they are more and more limited by the same things we are in the West, which is fundamentally technical progress. At first, this will emulate and mostly just deepen your capital. Capital per worker, which is the stock of capital, in the US is still way higher. For example, it’s still three times higher than in China. The US is more productive because it has more of that installed capital. But that first surge, that first bit of capital, that first bit of urbanization has a massive impact on productivity. And as you’d expect, it’s kind of an S-curve. It’s an impact that slows over time. In advanced economies, we point to investment, but it’s a different case. Instead of surging investment, it’s slowing investment. And you might ask, why am I talking about capital when this is a report about productivity? That’s because about 80 percent of productivity happens because each worker has more capital, more equipment. So in some ways, a productivity-rich world is an investment-rich world. Which is a good, simple framing. Because then it leads to an actionable question: how do we create an investment-rich world? The impact of gen AI on productivity Roberta Fusaro: The report talks about doing two things: boosting investments and boosting digital transformation. Almost every conversation that we have these days is about generative AI [gen AI]. When you talk about this acceleration and about digital transformation, what’s the link between gen AI and productivity? About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world’s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Olivia White: One aspect of whether AI and gen AI will boost productivity is, are we deploying it and is it in place, enabling individuals to be more productive in the way that they work? But the other aspect is, are people qualified and prepared to do the jobs that are needed as gen AI, and AI more generally, become more integrated into the way that companies work? And indeed, for people whose jobs may become less relevant as AI rolls out, are these workers being retrained? And are economies helping them find jobs that will enable them to be productive on an ongoing basis? So we can talk about the role that gen AI can play in boosting productivity. But we also need to talk about whether we’re helping with the job transitions that will be necessary to help economies and if it can happen in a way that’s inclusive and brings everybody along. Roberta Fusaro: Chris, anything you’d like to add? Chris Bradley: Let me talk through the waves that have happened. In the US, for example, in the early 2000s somewhere between a third and a fifth of all the US productivity growth was just from that electronics manufacturing boom. Then the second wave was that we all had ubiquitous connectivity and the internet, and then digitalization happened. If you’re a bank, you digitized your channels, you did e-commerce, and a lot of interactions were digitized. And I can tell you where we saw that in the productivity statistics, and it’s simple: nowhere. And why is that? Well, if you’re a supermarket chain, it’s not 100 percent clear that adding an e-commerce channel radically improved your productivity. But you had to do it. Customers wanted it. You had to duplicate two channels. So we’re in this kind of midgame where the digital revolution has partially happened. But it hasn’t yet been a productivity miracle. Which leads us to the third wave, which is intelligent machines and genuine automation and gen AI. And here we think it’s different this time, we really do. Under most of our midpoint scenarios, within ten years about one-third of what we do now is going to be automated. And that’s even allowing for adoption timelines and much more. This means that one-third of the stuff we do now is effectively going to be done for us. If we can redeploy that one-third, this could be a massive productivity surge. Why do I believe that this is different from the more standard digital technologies that came with the mobile internet? It’s because gen AI is an intelligent technology that can attach itself to many, many existing activities. We keep getting surprised by what gen AI should do and we need to stop being surprised. We need to start expecting to be surprised. Roberta Fusaro: What about all the concerns about gen AI disrupting people’s lives and livelihoods? Chris Bradley: I think gen AI is an interesting one because it can strike fear into people. Within our lifetimes, occupations that have been with us for generations, such as entry-level white-collar jobs, won’t exist because of gen AI. But I don’t think we should be Luddites. There are a few reasons why we should have a very open mind about this stuff. Actually, the biggest problem in economies is not unemployment. The biggest problem is that there’s not enough labor supply. And these demographic issues aren’t going away. We need automation just to get all the things done that we need to do. And what this means is that people will then move into doing jobs that only people can do. The impact of regulation on productivity Roberta Fusaro: How does regulation influence productivity going forward? Olivia White: It is unquestionable that regulation is an ingredient that matters in the productivity recipe. That said, it’s an extraordinarily complex topic. And it has aspects that can either enhance or hinder investment. As a result, even specific issues or specific regulations, if you look at them, have mixed or unclear effects. So rather than talking about regulation per se or specific aspects of regulation, it is extraordinarily important to look at potential pieces of regulation and ask things like what impact will it have on investment? Rather than talking about regulation per se or specific aspects of regulation, it is extraordinarily important to look at potential pieces of regulation and ask things like what impact will it have on investment? Chris Bradley: We don’t have a view that regulation is an unalloyed good or an unalloyed bad. We come back to what needs to happen to have productivity. In the long run, productivity is prosperity. That’s how we share in the benefits of our technology progress. There are a few channels at this point in time that seem a bit locked, that are important that regulators think about. The first one is the investment channel. We’ve got to make sure the financing and the ability to build things is easy. Readers should think about their countries and geographies and ask themselves, “Is it easier to make and build stuff now than it used to be or is it harder?” The other one is removing all of the barriers it takes to actually diffuse this technology into people’s everyday lives. Measuring productivity Roberta Fusaro: Do we still have the right tools to measure productivity? Olivia White: Many countries spend a great deal of effort to measure a variety of macroeconomic indicators, of which productivity is one, so that they really do have a very good sense of what’s happening. And some countries do a better job than others. And in some countries, it’s easier than in others just because of the facts on the ground. If you shift and ask what’s happening at the company level, if what we’re talking about is overall output per hour worked, then that’s the sum total of what’s happening across all of the private sector plus government. Are individual companies looking at this? The answer is that some are, and others are looking less at the overall output per amount of time worked and more in a more disaggregated way. Certain top-line indicators and certain cost indicators—would it help if they looked at these two things closer together in some instances? Absolutely. It would also help at the company level. Chris Bradley: Productivity is an economic concept. It’s mighty hard to measure. And then you get to questions such as, how do you value better quality of life? How do you value freer entertainment? How do you value all these things? And is there a whole bunch going on in our economy that is undervalued or not valued? I look at it quite practically. Since we’re measuring productivity in a consistent way across all these countries and across all these times, whether or not you might add or subtract a little bit of productivity for these measurement issues, the cross-country comparisons still matter. And all this equivocation about whether we are measuring productivity correctly does not disguise the fact that productivity has slowed down. It doesn’t disguise the fact that it’s slowed down in Europe a lot and that Europe has major productivity challenges. And it doesn’t disguise the fact that in the parts of the world that don’t yet have advanced-economy status, half to two-thirds of them are not converging fast enough with our productivity standards. The impact of demographics on productivity Roberta Fusaro: We’ve talked about a number of different productivity factors including automation, technology, and capital investment. I’m curious about the demographics piece. What role do demographics play in this quest for productivity? Olivia White: Most parts of the world are now aging. And that means most parts of the world are going to have a higher dependency ratio going forward. To support such a society, everybody working needs to generate more output per unit of labor because they need to be able to cover everybody. There is one counterexample to all of this, and that is Africa. Over the next 100 years or so, Africa will continue to grow its workforce and have a dependency ratio that’s actually going down. Chris Bradley: There were more babies born last year in Nigeria than there were in all of Europe. That’s an instant telescope to the future because it tells us what the future of the world is. The future of the world is African. Olivia White: There are certainly parts of the world where aging has already kicked in and has started to mount the kind of challenge I was talking about. Japan is an example. Italy is an example. To some degree, Germany is an example. In most parts of the world, we’re not there yet, but we’re at a sort of “cuspy” place. And it heightens the imperative for everything we’re talking about. Chris Bradley: Aging has an interesting impact on productivity. It seems that in most occupations, productivity peaks in a person’s 40s. And we’re still at a point where the median age in the US is about 39 years old, and that is the age of the bulk of US workers. Currently, the median age in China is about the same as it is in the US. But by 2050, the average age in China will be 51. And we’ll be at a point where more than 30 percent of its population is over 64. In fact, China’s peak year of working-age population was 2015. So ever since 2015, the working-age population has been in decline. This matters. We looked closely at the stats to try and figure out what the demographic impact on productivity was. It’s too small to see at this point. But we know it’s big. But the bigger impact of demographics is less productivity. It’s more about not having enough workers to go around. Looking ahead Roberta Fusaro: What are the next big productivity issues to study, beyond demographics? Chris Bradley: When it comes to our productivity agenda, a few things really matter. The first one is we’ve identified a very simple and essential focus that a pro-productivity world is, obviously, a pro-investment world. So what is that going to take? We’re seeing signs of life in the US. For example, construction and manufacturing in the US are up three or four times their pre-COVID-19 levels. And this AI thing we keep talking about, which is not just a bunch of smart people sitting in a room tapping on computers—this is concrete and silicone and energy in massive proportions. Another important angle we look at is what’s the future of globalization? One of the background features over the past 25 years has been    unfettered and highly cooperative global trade. This is a time when trade grew at two times the GDP. And this was not just massively productivity enhancing; it was very good for inflation as well. Now, it’s not going to disappear, because the world can’t work that way. We can’t work without each other. America imports 83 percent of its chips. China imports more chips than it does oil. So the world can’t work without each other. The key to closing Europe’s employment gap Lucia Rahilly: Next up, we hear from McKinsey senior partner Tania Holt, who says ethnic-minority employees are the talent Europe needs to fill jobs in the region’s tightening labor market.  Tania, historically, what has Europe’s relationship with inclusion been? Tania Holt: When you think about Europe, it has a long history of inclusion. That inclusion has placed Europe as a leading region in income equality, social mobility, and social progress. Among other factors, this inclusion has benefited the companies operating in Europe, as they have had access to a healthy and well-educated workforce. But there is a scope for Europe to go further by pursuing the inclusion of ethnic- and cultural-minority communities—which make up roughly 10 percent of Europe’s workforce—as a source of talent. We believe that this group could help close that talent gap and therefore be a potential growth driver for companies. Lucia Rahilly: Can you talk to us about the labor market in Europe? How tight is it at this juncture? Tania Holt: By looking at the data for EU-27, plus Switzerland and Norway, we see that the region is experiencing labor shortages overall. If we look at the data since 2020, the vacancy rate has increased by 70 percent. This means that in 2022, we had six million vacant jobs. We also looked at executives’ perceptions. We created a survey that asked executives, “What do you experience as a barrier to growth in your businesses?” We found that labor shortages were one of the top-three barriers on the executive agenda. Lucia Rahilly: Are there particular jobs or categories of work that are proving most difficult to fill? Tania Holt: We looked both at what we call in the report “ low-skill and high-skill occupations .” Let’s take the low-skill group first. What we saw was that some of the jobs with the highest vacancy rates are elementary and personal-service workers, at 6.4 and 4 percent, respectively. The second group of jobs that saw significant vacancies was in the tech sector. Overall, we found that approximately a fifth of the vacant jobs in Europe are jobs that require tertiary education. Ethnocultural minorities are currently underrepresented in these professions even though they have similar levels of higher education. This is often a bit of a surprise to people. Lucia Rahilly: That is a surprise. What is inhibiting employment among these populations? Are there particular barriers that you would call out from the research? Tania Holt: We conducted a survey of nearly 4,000 employees in five countries across medium and large publicly traded companies. The ethnocultural minorities in our survey were twice as likely as their nonminority peers to report facing obstacles when securing the right employment opportunities. They cited perceived discrimination based on cultural background as among the leading reasons—22 percentage points higher than nonminority employees. The second question we asked was regarding the challenges ethnocultural minorities face when they are employed and they’re looking to advance from within. Fifty-four percent of the ethnocultural-minority respondents reported that they had missed out on a career advancement opportunity such as a raise or a promotion. They also reported that their  ethnic background was the second-most-cited barrier for why they had missed out on that particular advancement. Finally, the third thing that really stood out to us was inclusion. We saw that the ethnocultural minorities surveyed were 2.5 times more likely than nonminority employees to report facing biased behaviors and microaggressions on the job. An example of a microaggression was being confused for someone else of the same ethnic minority. Lucia Rahilly: What are some immediate steps European leaders could take to get rolling on what you described as a triple-win opportunity? Tania Holt: It’s about having a robust ethnocultural-minority-inclusion strategy and having that strategy be driven by data. We did an outside-in analysis, and 72 percent of the largest companies in Europe do not have a strategy for this particular group. To get the ball rolling, the first step for many companies is to sit down and put a strategy together. I also said data was important. It’s often cited as a barrier because all the various executives want to make sure they are GDPR-compliant. 2 General Data Protection Regulation. And so we saw that some of the companies that are able to succeed were really looking into the data and used that data to put the different inclusion initiatives together. We’ve seen a real difference in three ways. The first one is by having employer resource groups, which is where you put the ethnocultural minorities together and provide a safe space for the group to engage, have conversations, and come up with initiatives. The second thing that makes a real difference is having targeted sponsorship programs and leadership development programs that are made available to the ethnic cultural minorities. Having antibias and inclusive-leadership training available for all managers in the companies makes a real difference to the experience that the ethnocultural minorities are having in the workspace. And the last thing that would make a real difference is cross-sectoral engagement across the companies. Many of the companies are very keen about engaging on this in forums through their associations because they realize that they are early in the journey. One of the things that we know makes a difference when organizations are early on in their journey is that they have an opportunity to share and learn from each other.

Syverson is George C. Tiao Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. His work focuses on the interactions between firm structure, market structure, and productivity. In this podcast, he covers topics including the following: Janet Bush (co-host): So, Michael, productivity is a perennial issue—the endless quest, the Holy Grail—for economists. And today we are talking to one of the experts on this subject. What would you think might be a key driver of productivity in the years ahead? Michael Chui (co-host): Well, as you know, I do a lot of work on AI, and that has to be in the frame for being a game changer. It is going to be everywhere and have an impact in practically every sector. And my guess is that it will have a profound impact on productivity over time. Janet Bush: Spot on. Our guest today believes that AI is, and I quote, “the best candidate for a new general-purpose technology we’ve had in decades” and he thinks it could be the key to ending the productivity slowdown we have all been seeing. Michael Chui: That really interests me. I would like to hear more. Janet Bush: So, Chad, welcome to the podcast. Chad Syverson: Thank you. It’s nice to be here. Janet Bush: So tell us a bit about your journey to becoming an economist. What fascinated you in particular about productivity? Chad Syverson: I was a mechanical engineering student in college. Like, I think, a lot of high school students who are good at science and math, everyone tells you, “You should be an engineer.” And I liked airplanes, so I thought, “OK, I’ll be a mechanical engineer.” I didn’t quite understand what a mechanical engineer did, but that’s what I started at, and we had to take principles of microeconomics to fulfill the engineering degree requirements. And I loved it. I loved it so much I decided to take principles of macroeconomics, even though it didn’t matter for any requirement. And I loved that, and so on and so forth. Eventually, there came an epiphany. February 18, 1994. I heard someone give a speech. I couldn’t tell you what they said today. I couldn’t tell you what they said one year after I heard it, but all I know is I walked out of that speech thinking, “I’m going to be an economist. I don’t want to be an engineer. I want to be an economist.” And from that point forward, that was kind of my trajectory. I finished my engineering undergrad degree but got a side degree in economics at the same time. I went and got my PhD at the University of Maryland, and now I’m here. This is my first academic placement after my PhD, here at Chicago. And I’ve been here for 23 years. I don’t think engineering’s completely left, though. We’re going to be talking about productivity today. And I think the whole reason I got interested in productivity as an economist is, I still like to think about how things are put together, so to speak. It’s just the conceptualization of it is different when you study productivity as an economist than when you’re actually thinking about design and production of physical products as a mechanical engineer. Janet Bush: A lot of people would see economics as terribly boring and a black box and a complete mystery. What was it that spoke to your soul? Chad Syverson: At first, it was like a fascination of how the discipline took what I thought were intuitive things—like, “Oh, if this is true, then you would think this, then you would think that,” and so on—and actually formalized it. So when I saw supply and demand and how it works, it’s like, “Oh, yeah. That’s totally it.” That boils down things you think through and hear people talk about in a way that’s really crisp and useful. So I liked that, initially. But the more I learned about it, it was just, like, “This is just the best framework for understanding the world with the fewest moving parts,” you know? It doesn’t explain everything, but boy, it explains a lot. Both how people act and how organizations and companies act. That’s what I love about it. It’s just the best way. I want to know about the world, and I wanted to learn the tool kit that I thought would be the most useful for it. And that’s economics. Janet Bush: When I was an economics journalist, I used to say, “Economics is about life, it’s about everything. So you should be interested in it.” So why is productivity important? Chad Syverson: Well, there are two answers. One is, at the micro level, if you’re a company, productivity is one of the best predictors of the fortunes of your business. So just a fact: If you look at any even narrow-slice industry or market, you’ll find big differences in productivity across the businesses that operate within that. And what people have found in thousands of studies now, and basically without exception, the more productive businesses are much more likely to survive. They’re more likely to grow faster. If you want to be a successful business, you need to be a highly productive business. It’s also good for workers. Workers at more productive companies get paid more. It’s good for consumers. Consumers who buy products from more productive companies tend to pay lower quality-adjusted prices. So productivity is good for kind of everything on the business side of things. That’s the micro level. And then the macro level is where the importance really kicks in, because we know productivity growth is the only way we can get sustained increases in material well-being. You cannot get increases in, say, GDP per capita over the long run without productivity growth. It’s that simple. And it’s quantitatively one for one, so if productivity growth slows down by 1 percent a year, you should expect GDP per capita growth to slow down by about 1 percent per year, and vice versa if it speeds up. So both the existence of increases in material well-being and the rate at which they increase are determined by productivity growth. Janet Bush: There’s a perception that productivity means efficiency and lost jobs. I remember somebody said to me, “Oh, productivity—you’re fired.” Unpack that for us. Chad Syverson: That is an example of the fallacy of reasoning causality from an accounting identity. There are many specific ways to measure productivity, but they’re all basically ratios of output to input, how much comes out of a production process divided by how many inputs go into it. And the notion that you’re describing with that person’s comment comes from looking at that definition and thinking, “Oh, that’s how you causally affect productivity. So OK, I want productivity to be higher. It’s outputs over inputs, so if I make inputs smaller, productivity will go up.” Well, the problem with that is—and this is true whenever you reason from an accounting identity—it’s not just inputs that are changing when you decide to cut inputs. You know, those inputs are doing something, presumably, and you’re going to affect what they’re doing if you try to cut those inputs, like, say, workers or worker hours. And that might be useful stuff that makes output. And it’s quite possible you could actually reduce output even more than you reduce input, so therefore, your productivity actually has gone down. It’s kind of interesting. You know, I totally understand sort of the sentiment behind what that person said. I hear it a lot, but it’s usually in that direction, the messing up the identity for causality. Because if someone said, “Oh, I need productivity to go up, I know what I’ll do, I’ll just make more output”—if you said that to someone, they’d say, “OK, what magic wand do you have that lets you wave and get more output for nothing?” Because everyone recognizes, well, if you want more output, you need more inputs, too, et cetera. But somehow that doesn’t quite always become as obvious when someone does the inverse, which is, “Well, I’ll just cut inputs, and of course productivity will go up.” But as I said, that’s not the only thing that’s going to change when you do that. Subscribe to the Forward Thinking podcast Janet Bush: I like that. So how are we doing on productivity? MGI’s recent report , which is about investing in productivity, said that over the past quarter century, median economic productivity had jumped sixfold. But then there were huge variations, so emerging economies did very well. They were in the fast lane. They’re catching up with advanced economies, maybe in the next 25 years. But then, in advanced economies, productivity is stagnant. There are slow-lane emerging economies. So all together, how are we doing? Chad Syverson: I think, more recently, not so great, to be honest. Over the long, long haul, we’ve got reasonably good data in the USA going back about 130, 140 years. Labor productivity, output per worker, per worker hour goes up by, roughly speaking, an average of 2 percent per year. But there are big sort of long cycles of acceleration and deceleration, so periods where it’s above it, periods where it’s below it. And it’s been pretty clear in the US that since the mid–2000s, we’re in a productivity growth slowdown. It’s been somewhere between 1 and 1.5 percent per year, which is below the long-run average and even trending more towards the bottom end of that, so closer to 1 percent per year in the late 2010s, say. It’s not just in the US, so basically the world overall, most countries at all income levels experienced a productivity growth slowdown over the past decade, decade and a half. From different levels. As you mentioned, different economies tend to have different average productivity growth levels. But everyone’s seeing the slowdown from the average over the last ten, 15 years. And that’s really been, I think, for the people who pay attention to the macro end of productivity, that’s been the thing that’s gathered the most attention from us. It’s, like, “OK, why did this happen?” Just to give your listeners a quantitative sense of what that means, in the US, productivity growth between ʼ95 and 2004, before the slowdown started, was about 2.9 percent per year. So we’ve experienced a productivity slowdown of about half. Which means, like I was saying before, the relationship is about one to one with GDP per capita growth. So if you experience a labor productivity growth decline of 1.5 percent per year, that implies about a 1.5-percent-per-year slowdown in GDP growth per capita. You sustain that over 15 years, and now you’ve got a real gap in what your GDP is versus what it could’ve been. And if you run out the math on that, it’s easily over a third of GDP right now. That is to say, had productivity growth not slowed down, US GDP would be about 35 percent higher than it is right now. So it matters. One year of a slowdown is one year, but you stack it up year after year after year, like we’ve been experiencing—“we,” the world, really—it adds up to something quite big. Janet Bush: So, as you say, a lot of work is going into the reason why. What’s your theory? Chad Syverson: Well, I think there’s a couple things going on. One is that the acceleration that we saw in the late ʼ90s, early 2000s, I think, was the first IT wave sort of coming to fruition. Businesses really started to figure out at a high clip how to use IT technologies to change what they were doing and to do what they were doing better. And so there was that period of gathering the low-hanging fruit, so to speak. And I think that naturally worked itself through the system, and what didn’t come quite as readily is the next thing to do with the technologies. Now, it’s been really transformative over that 15 years and some narrow-slice businesses—you think about media and stuff like that, it’s greatly affected that—but just broadly speaking, it hasn’t diffused through as much of the economy as it did in the early IT period. So I think that’s the biggest thing. I don’t have a short story of why the fruit stopped there. I think it’s probably multicausal and multifaceted, but I think that’s the biggest thing. Something I’ve written about lately is that there can also be a period when new technologies arise where you actually get slow measured productivity growth. And so, the technology can be present. It can be being placed into service by businesses, but you don’t actually see it in the productivity numbers. Now, I don’t think—and we actually ran through the calculations in our studies on the issue—that’s not the cause of the productivity slowdown, but I think it’s something to keep in mind as we look at the situation now and going forward. Janet Bush: AI is on everybody’s minds. And obviously it’s not diffused enormously widely, but it is beginning to diffuse. Is that a game changer, do you think? Chad Syverson: I think it can be. I will say, I think it’s the best candidate for a new general-purpose technology we’ve had in decades. And it’s made me more optimistic that we will end the productivity growth slowdown than anything else that’s happened since I started looking deeply at the slowdown ten years ago. So, yeah, I’m on the optimistic side. I think it has amazing potential. As you say, it hasn’t diffused that widely yet, but the early returns, so to speak, I think are quite optimistic. And one can have fun imagining all the potential gains that could come from applying AI tools in a number of different situations. Janet Bush: What sectors do you think might see the biggest gains? Chad Syverson: That’s a hard one. And I’m not just punting because no economist wants to be pinned down on predictions, but that’s a little bit of it. But one lesson of general-purpose technologies is, their full effect comes when they’re put together with complementary investments, often intangible. It’s not usually the direct replacement effect that drives the productivity gains. It’s these complementary things. What that means is, you wouldn’t look at AI and say, “Oh, what does AI do?” “Well, it predicts text, so I’m going to go look and see where text prediction would be the biggest thing.” OK, if you’re a lawyer and you’re writing briefs, you’re not going to do that anymore. That all may happen. I’m not denying that’s going to be part of what AI does. But I think the biggest things and the broadest things that AI could do, we haven’t really fully grasped yet, because it needs to be put together with other stuff that’s currently being invented and created. My guess is, the biggest, the most affected sectors, we don’t really know yet. And we might be surprised actually by quite a few of them. Now, if you want to say, “What things are going to be affected the earliest?,” then it is going to be the direct replacement stuff like I was talking about. But the biggest effects, I think, it’s really hard to pin down, and we’ll have a better idea ten, 15 years from now than we do now. Janet Bush: MGI did some work on the link between intangibles investment and productivity , and one of the interesting things that came out of that was that it’s not just the investment in digital or intangibles or whatever. It’s the way you manage it. It’s the managerial skill that’s twinned with that. That sounds to me very much what you were saying. Chad Syverson: I totally agree. In fact, I would classify the managerial skill, talent, processes as intangible inputs of a business. You know, I mentioned those big productivity differences within even narrowly defined industries before. Even before AI was around, we have good evidence that some of those differences are caused by differences in management practices, manager skill, et cetera. I view that as an intangible that is paired with technologies like AI, and the quality of that pairing is going to matter hugely for the productivity effect. Janet Bush: When you look at general-purpose technologies from the past and AI, are there big differences? Is there a timing difference? I mean, can you guess how it’s going to roll out and what the macroeconomic effect is going to be? Chad Syverson: We know a little bit, so we did some calculations. This is work I did on what’s called the productivity J-curve. You get this period of initial undermeasurement of the true productivity effects of new technology, and then, later, overmeasurement. This is work I did with Erik Brynjolfsson and Daniel Rock. We did some calculations treating existing technologies, kind of going back in time and supposing, “Oh, here comes this new technology. We’re going to pretend like it’s got this AI sort of effect going, where you’re not going to fully see it early and to compute exactly what you ask.” Like, how long does this stuff take for it to work through this measurement issue? And the answer is, we looked at computer hardware, computer software, and R&D spending in general. In each of those cases, the answer is decades. You can have a period of undermeasurement that’s ten to 20 years long. And then, of course, the overmeasurement period on the back end can last just as long. The size of this undermeasurement varies over that period. So it might be five to ten years before you hit bottom of the undermeasurement, and then you start coming back in the other direction. But the point is, you can go pretty long periods of time where the technology’s out there, it’s being installed, it’s starting to be used, but you’re still not seeing its full effect reflected in the productivity statistics. And we talk about historical examples, Solow’s famous comment that he saw the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics. That was exactly that phenomenon. And then there are other examples, going back in history even further, of periods where the technologies are commercially available and they’re starting to be used, but you don’t see it in the productivity stats yet. This can go on for a period of multiple years. Janet Bush: I think that there’s a general agreement that AI has massive potential. But you’re not going to see that in the productivity numbers, so is that leap of faith mean that we’re not going to invest enough? Chad Syverson: I don’t know. I mean, that’s a good question. Like, do companies look at the productivity statistics when they’re making their investment decisions, or do they have a more sort of ear-to-the-ground feel for the true effects? I think it’s a little more the latter. The problem is, it’s hard to aggregate up those ears to the ground for people who want to measure what’s going on economy-wide, so you can tell stories about specific companies, like, “Oh, it’s not in the productivity numbers, but look at that company, how transformative the technology has been there.” That can be true. If you can quantify that across all companies and add it up, you’d have a nice alternative to the official productivity statistics that might help you see things better, but that’s super hard to do. So to answer your question more directly, I don’t think the mismeasurement is going to cause too much of a malinvestment problem or a misallocated investment problem. But I think it’s going to be hard for those of us who track the total effects of these one-by-one investments. It’s really going to be hard to know what’s going on. I should be a little careful. The undermeasurement problem means an undermeasurement; doesn’t mean it wouldn’t show up at all. I mean, it could be that the true productivity effect of AI ends up being an acceleration in the productivity growth of one-and-a-half percent per year, but you’re only going to see 0.8 percent per year or something in the actual statistics. So it’s undermeasurement, but you might still see a bump in the actual stats. Janet Bush: Going back to the “where is productivity growing” question, do you see any sign of the slump ending? Is there any evidence that things are beginning to pick up, with or without AI? Chad Syverson: Yes, a little. If you just look at, say, in the US numbers, quarterly output per worker, the last year’s been pretty good. We’ve, well—zoom back. We’re on this trend. The trend wasn’t great, OK? What happened through COVID is, actually, we went well above trend, huge acceleration in 2021 and then flattened out, then came down and now have accelerated again. Now, that whole process basically created a wave that got us back to the trend we would have been on had COVID never happened—which, again, wasn’t a great trend—but we’re back on the trend. That COVID volatility was basically, I think, a lot of composition- and utilization-affected stuff. Things that tend to happen to productivity statistics in the business cycle. It’s not, quote, “real,” it’s just noise measured because of how we actually measure stuff. But, and here’s the but, the last year and a half, to get us back to that trend on the back end of that wave, now that we’re at that trend, the next year’s going to be really important, because it’s going to be, “All right, are we going to flatten out back on that discouraging trend we were in, in the 2010s, or are we going to continue accelerating through the trend?” Because right now, the last three quarters have been well above that trend growth rate. And I actually am a little thinking the latter, because of some other data. So what’s been going on—and this is another trend that’s been parallel to and may be somewhat connected with the productivity growth slowdown—is there’s been a long-running decline in measures of dynamism in the economy, especially in the US, but throughout much of the OECD. What do I mean? Total labor turnover, people leaving jobs and getting new jobs, for example. Business formation. How many new businesses are being created every year? Those things have been on a long-run decline, and when I say long run, I mean, back to the ʼ80s at least. OK, so there have been 30, 40 years of slowdowns in measures of dynamism. And some people were saying, “Well, maybe this is tied to the productivity growth slowdown.” Like, these chickens are coming home to roost. Well, what’s happened since COVID, as we’ve emerged from COVID, those things have turned around. After decades of decline, labor market dynamism accelerated again. Business formation in the US is up one-third. One-third more businesses are being formed per month now than were in 2019. This isn’t just folks who are tired of the office life starting a consulting company in their spare bedroom. If you look specifically at what are called high-propensity businesses, or businesses that at foundation have features that we know predict hiring and growth for those businesses in the future, those are also up a third. So it really does look like there’s a reinjection of whatever the secret sauce is that creates a dynamic economy in the last several years. And I think that that’s what makes me encouraged that the last three quarters of pretty fast productivity growth might continue. We might actually accelerate through that return to trend, rather than just stop at the trend. I don’t know if that stuff has anything to do or a lot to do with AI one way or the other, but I view it as sort of a second piece of evidence, aside from the specific productivity statistics, that makes me optimistic about the near run at least. Janet Bush: In the US, what do you think the secret sauce is that has caused this uptick in these indicators? Chad Syverson: Honestly, I don’t know. If I had to say something, it might be optimism about AI or other new technologies, you know, biotech and stuff like that. There’s been a lot of investment in manufacturing lately, especially tied to the energy sector, so it might be a little of that as well. But I’m kind of just guessing. I’m not sure, and I don’t know if anyone’s really pinned it down in a way that I thought was specific yet. Janet Bush: Is there an element of sustainability innovation, do you think? Chad Syverson: You mean, environmental sustainability? Janet Bush: Yes. Chad Syverson: I think the only way we’re going to achieve climate goals that have been set is through innovation. I mean, that’s the only way forward. We have to innovate our way out of it. I think it’s already happening. You look at the advances that have been made in solar and battery technology in the past ten years. They’ve been amazing and basically unpredicted by the experts. So now that we have to, I think, reduce barriers to installation, that’s a real issue, I know, in the States and in some other countries, too. But, yeah, I think innovation is the key to achieving sustainability. That’s the only way we can do it. Janet Bush: I was just thinking, because America has put a lot of money behind green tech, so that’s why I asked the question, I was thinking that that might be one of the ingredients of the secret sauce. Chad Syverson: Could be, yeah, I agree. Janet Bush: And what about other countries? We have talked about the US, but is the picture very different in Europe, for example, or China? Chad Syverson: It, unfortunately, does seem to be a little different in much of Europe. China, it’s hard to know. The data are perhaps not as reliable as, say, other OECD countries. But if you look at Europe, the UK in particular has kind of had the same sort of slowdown, but quantitatively it’s been perhaps as deep as it’s been anywhere. And unlike in the US, where you get this volatility over COVID and then this reacceleration in the last year or so, you haven’t seen that in the UK. You haven’t seen that in a lot of the European OECD countries, which raises, I guess, the issue of causality. Again, what’s going on? What part of the secret sauce here isn’t there? Is it that AI is not moving things as much there as here, or is it other stuff that we’re talking about, with green tech, et cetera? I don’t know the answer, but it is true that what you see in the US statistics is not shining through so brightly in European countries. Janet Bush: Our recent research suggested that higher inflation and interest rates could actually encourage productive capital allocation and therefore, ultimately, higher productivity growth. Do you buy that? Chad Syverson: You know, I like the story. The higher the interest rate is, like, “OK, you have a higher hurdle rate now, and so only really good investments are going to be made,” et cetera. I’ve actually got some colleagues here who looked a lot at businesses’ actual hurdle rates, how they set their hurdle rates, et cetera. And it turns out they’re way higher than market interest rates, and also they don’t move that closely with market interest rates. So while I like the theory, I’m not so sure on the empirical side of movement from, say, 25 basis points fed funds rate up to 450 basis points is going to greatly affect the actual hurdle a company uses. Maybe it will a little, on the edges. The inflation thing, actually, I had this idea long ago that inflation hides inefficiency. Like, you can get away with just raising prices when your costs go up in a high-inflation environment. But in a low-inflation environment you can’t, so you have to figure out how to keep your costs down. I tried to test that in the day. I couldn’t find any evidence of it, so I’ve been a little skeptical about that particular thing ever since I went and dug for it and couldn’t find it. But it could well be my own incompetence that kept me from finding it. Janet Bush: Surely not. Chad Syverson: Oh, give me a chance. I can be really incompetent. Janet Bush: One of the other themes of our times is what some people call deglobalization or the fragmentation of trade . And if trade relations were to reconfigure and fragment, that could have an impact on the flows of technology and IP and all the rest of it. Do you see that as a factor in productivity going forward? Chad Syverson: Yes. I think it could be. I think, I don’t know if it’s a “for everything.” I think it’s a process that could play out over five, ten, maybe 15 years. But surely those involve disruptive costs, just adjustment costs of any type when you reconfigure a production chain. So, yeah, I think there could be productivity effects to that. I’m not sure how big they are. I sort of view it at the same time as companies might be acting like they’re willing to pay somewhat higher costs to have a reconfigured supply chain, in exchange for, basically, insurance. Like, that certain political economy events that might happen would be less costly in the future if they do this reconfiguration now. Basically, I think, you could justify it as paying an insurance premium. We’re going to have a new kind of production chain with slightly higher costs, but in exchange, volatility that might exist in the future will be reduced. That’s kind of how I view the trade-offs that any company could look at. Also, from a macro economy standpoint, you’d want to value that insurance value. The problem is, it’s really hard to actually do that in the numbers. It’s hard to see what didn’t happen. But nonetheless, conceptually, I think that’s one useful way to think about it. Janet Bush: Casting around for other themes of our age that might have an impact on productivity, we’ve touched on the net-zero transition. You mentioned energy costs. How does that play into it? Chad Syverson: If you want to get really speculative, I talked about the productivity slowdown now. The last worldwide productivity slowdown started in the mid-1970s. In fact, it’s pretty sharp—1974, specifically, it seemed to be. Now, is that coincidence that it was just after the oil crisis and the price of oil tripling and the price of energy in general going up very quickly? I don’t know. It could be. Some people speculated one way or the other, but, you know, energy is an important input into a lot of stuff. And if it becomes cheaper, you might think a lot of things can happen more economically than it did before. It’s sort of interesting. It seems important, seems to go into everything, but if you look at, say, the expenditure share, the fraction of revenues that manufacturers spend on energy, it’s like 2 or 3 percent. And so you’d say, “Well, that’s not that important.” But you know, that 2 or 3 percent isn’t very substitutable for other stuff. You can switch one supplier of widgets for another, but in the end, you kind of need energy. What are you going to substitute for energy, right? So while it might not be a great share of expenditure, it might be a very important cog in the wheel. If you make that cog really cheap, the wheels you can attach it to could get quite big. I think that would be the story, where energy is sort of a linchpin for productivity growth. Do I know that’s the way the world works for sure? No, but I think that story is alluring. Janet Bush: In the last of our speculative themes that I was thinking about, aging, do you think that that’s a factor in productivity? Chad Syverson: There is some evidence that demographics of a country actually affects its business formation rates. We were talking about that, and some other—not just the amount of investment but the direction of investment. If you have an older population, businesses invest in things that are targeted at an older population, which can have different knock-on productivity effects than investments made to serve a younger population. So there is some evidence that that matters. How big is that right now? I think it varies across countries. Obviously, different countries have different demographic profiles. Do I think that was a big factor in the worldwide productivity slowdown? I’d be surprised if it were, but it might be one more thing adding to the top of the pile. I think we’re all going to find out, because it’s pretty clear from birth rates that most countries are going to see aging of their population over the coming decades. So that’s definitely one thing I’m going to be keeping an eye on as I age in my own job. Janet Bush: It was interesting, we did some work on the future of Asia , how Asia’s doing, and we made the observation that productivity had been soaring, or doing pretty well, we think, in China. But China is aging, and Japan, South Korea. And so that productivity needs to be replaced. Those workers need to be replaced by workers in countries in Asia that are less productive. And therefore, you have a double problem. You’ve got to switch the labor, and that labor is low productivity, say, in India, for example. Is that something that you recognize? Chad Syverson: It makes sense to me. I haven’t looked at it in my own work, but I can see how that could happen. I think it is happening. Whatever effect it has, what you describe is going on. We’re seeing—you talked about the reconfiguration of supply chains. You’re seeing things move out of China into Vietnam, into India, two big destination locations. Some here in North America, to Mexico. So yeah, that’s going on, and the question is, how big is it? And then how long is this sort of adjustment process going to be? You would expect those workers in, say, Vietnam or India to become more productive over time, just as they did in China when China became the major manufacturing center it is now. But the issue is, how long does that take? Janet Bush: I just wanted to touch on how productivity diffuses. Have you done some work on that? Chad Syverson: I haven’t done a ton. I’ve done diffusion, sort of, inside a company. But we know—we, the academic researchers who look at productivity—there are spillovers across companies. It’s been identified in a lot of different settings, different kinds of industries, different countries, et cetera. And you do find evidence that, especially, large companies that tend to spin off a lot of workers, which themselves will start to spin off companies, et cetera, we know that certain industries basically evolved that way. You look, going back historically, at automobiles and tires. You had one big fount from which the whole industry sprung, and you can see that more recently in certain parts of the tech world as well. You know, the alums of a particular company go off and basically create a whole industry from scratch. We know those spillovers exist. We know a little less about the particular mechanisms. Sometimes it’s workers leaving, starting their own businesses. Sometimes it’s conversations where no one ever leaves, but knowledge somehow gets out of the company one way or the other. Sometimes it’s very local, the spillover. Sometimes it’s much less local. The particular mechanisms can vary, and we don’t know the nuts and bolts—sometimes literally the nuts and bolts—details of how that diffusion happens, but it’s clear that it does. And that certain companies have outsize influence on the future trajectory of an industry than others. Janet Bush: And just on the public sector, I mean, that is a bit of a black box in terms of measuring productivity, I believe. But the general assumption is that productivity in the public sector is lower than in the private sector. Is there hope for the public sector? And where will that come from? Chad Syverson: Let me start with the end. Yes, there’s hope. Where will it come from? Let’s take a step back. The really difficult thing in general with public-sector productivity is, what’s the output, right? And that’s true for some private sectors, too. Like, define the output of the insurance industry. Well, jeez, what exactly is it that they’re creating? But for the public sector, you see in general, it’s what are they actually creating? How do we want to measure what comes out of a bureaucracy that people value? Nonetheless, I think you can identify whether whatever they do is done well or not. I’ve been thinking a lot about the poor productivity performance in the construction sector lately. And the way that interfaces with the public sector is infrastructure project management. You’ve got some department of transportation that needs to build a bridge or whatnot. And it’s managing this construction company, or these construction companies, as it builds it. You can be good at managing construction projects or you can be bad at it. Lately, it seems like in particular, we haven’t been so good at it. But why can’t a department of transportation be a really efficient manager of construction projects? That’s just one specific example of, even in a world where it’s hard to know exactly what the output of a bureaucracy is, whatever it’s doing, you can do it poorly or you can do it well. And you’d much rather do it well than poorly. And I think there’s a lot of scope for improvements along a number of dimensions beyond just departments of transportation in the public sector. Part of it is, to go back to our earlier stuff about management, management matters in the public sector too. It’s not just well-managed companies are good private companies. Well-managed governments get things done with fewer resources than poorly managed governments, and that’s what productivity is about, fundamentally, is doing stuff with fewer resources. Janet Bush: Absolutely. Just before we come to a close, is there anything that is on your mind in particular about productivity, the times we live in? How do you see it? Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic? Chad Syverson: I’m as optimistic now as I’ve been in a long time, in part because I started thinking a few years ago, AI might be the next general-purpose technology. I’m not really a doomer about either the more apocalyptic stories about AI or even the more “so many people are going to lose their jobs.” I can’t make any guarantees, but we’ve had general-purpose technologies diffuse before. We’ve always figured out things for people to do. We’re pretty ingenious, even if we are natural intelligence rather than artificial intelligence. We’ll think of stuff for people to work on. So that’s part of my optimism. I also mentioned the resurgence in dynamism and those sort of things, which turned around a decades-long decline. That also added to my optimism, after being rather pessimistic for quite some time when I was studying the productivity slowdown. I’d also add, we talk a lot about AI, but I think biotech has seen some big and really hopeful advances lately. I think that also could be a big factor in the coming decades, so that kind of adds to my optimism, too. Janet Bush: Yes, the biology sphere is really fascinating, and all of us benefited from mRNA technology. Chad Syverson: Yes. Janet Bush: So, last question. What one unproductive activity should we be doing more of? Chad Syverson: Oh, boy. This is out of my scope of analysis. You know what? Rearing children. I think it’s important. I don’t know if it’s productive, unproductive, or somewhere in between. I’ve got four of my own. It’s the biggest thing you could do with your life, I think. And if you can do it yourself or help people you love with their own children, do it. I think that’s just an important part of life. Janet Bush: Three cheers to that. Well, Chad, thanks so much for joining us. That was really fun and fascinating. Chad Syverson: You’re welcome. I had a great time. Chad Syverson is George C.

For comprehensive definitions relating to the energy system, see “Glossary” in Climate change 2014: Mitigation of climate change , Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), Cambridge University Press, 2014. The system has been optimized over centuries, is deeply embedded in the global economy, and serves billions of people, if not yet all of humanity. 2 Number of people lacking access to reliable electricity services , United Nations Development Programme, 2022. And it is high-performing. Energy can be dispatched relatively easily where and when it is needed because current fuels are energy-dense and easily transportable. Supply can be ramped up and down quickly.

For all its advantages, today’s system also has critical flaws. About two-thirds of energy is currently wasted. 3 Clemens Forman et al., “Estimating the global waste heat potential,” Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, volume 57, May 2016; Energy flow charts , Flowcharts, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Department of Energy, accessed July 2024; and Paul Martin, The primary energy fallacy – or, committest thou NOT the 2nd sin of thermodynamics! , June 25, 2024. And the system generates more than 85 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). 4 Global CO 2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes total about 37 gigatons, with about five gigatons in agriculture, forestry, and other land use. In the case of methane, more than approximately 35 percent of global emissions arise from the energy system, from combustion and industrial processes, with the remaining 65 percent divided between agriculture, at about 40 percent, and waste and other sectors at about 25 percent (data for 2021); McKinsey EMIT database, 2023. Companies and countries are now engaged in an effort to transition the energy system and reduce those emissions—and to do so in just a few decades. That is a big ask. In the digital age, we have become accustomed to lightning-fast transformations. TikTok took nine months and ChatGPT only two months to gain 100 million users. 5 “ChatGPT witnesses massive rise, Chatbot gains 100 million users in two months,” Economic Times , March 2023. But an energy system is a physical entity, and historical energy transitions have taken many decades or even centuries. Complicating the task of building a new low-emissions energy system is that it coincides with the need for it to continue to grow to expand access to energy for billions of people who still do not have it, thereby economically empowering them. Real progress has been made, but the transition remains in its early stages. Thus far, deployment of low-emissions technologies is only at about 10 percent of the levels required by 2050 in most areas, and that has been in comparatively easy use cases. More demanding challenges are bound to emerge as the world confronts more difficult use cases across geographies. Low-emissions technologies such as solar and wind power and electric vehicles (EVs) have advantageous properties and can be brought together to deliver high performance. But deploying them well and progressing the transition further requires understanding the physical realities of the energy transition—the “hard stuff.” Recognizing that the energy transition is first and foremost a physical transformation is a truth that can get lost in the abstraction of net-zero scenarios. But it is vital if the new energy system is to retain, or even improve on, the performance of the current one and secure an affordable, reliable, competitive path to net zero. 6 An affordable, reliable, competitive path to net zero , McKinsey Sustainability, November 2023. It is also important to take a holistic view of the socioeconomic impacts of different transition pathways and to use this perspective to help inform decision making. See Climate Transition Impact Framework: Essential elements for an equitable and inclusive transition , McKinsey Sustainability, December 2023; and “Solving the net-zero equation: Nine requirements for a more orderly transition,” McKinsey Sustainability, October 2021. The observation has widely been attributed to Albert Einstein that, given an hour to solve a problem, he would spend 55 minutes defining the problem and five thinking about solutions. 7 Nell Derick Debevoise, “The third critical step in problem solving that Einstein missed,” Forbes , January 26, 2021. It is in that spirit that this research builds on the vast body of literature on the energy transition and pathways to net zero. Across seven domains, it identifies 25 significant physical challenges that must be overcome if the transition is to succeed.  Three aspects stand out across these challenges: the maturity and performance of low-emissions technologies; the degree of scaling these technologies and their support infrastructure and supply chains would need as this massive energy system is transformed; and interdependencies across the different parts of the system. Click on the tiles for summaries of 25 challenges across 7 domains Download the full report for an in-depth review of each domain and associated physical challenges. Seven domains of the energy system would need to be transformed, and this effort is in its early stages The energy transition involves the physical transformation of seven deeply interlinked domains. The first is the power domain, which needs to reduce its own emissions and to scale dramatically to provide low-emissions energy to the three large consuming domains: mobility , industry , and buildings . The final three domains are enablers of the energy transition: raw materials , especially critical minerals; new fuels, such as hydrogen and other energy carriers ; and carbon and energy reduction (see sidebar, “Why understanding the physical realities of the transition matters”). Why understanding the physical realities of the transition matters Understanding the physical realities of the energy transition—namely the physical properties of low-emissions solutions and the nature of the physical transformation—is critical to many aspects of designing a successful transition. First, understanding the physical properties of low-emissions solutions can help design a new system that delivers performance on a par with the current system and does so reliably. This matters because the energy system is vital for driving economic growth and progress. As discussed later, this is not a trivial task and it requires a careful understanding of the performance and advantages of low-emissions technologies, innovation needs, and how such technologies can effectively be brought together in an interconnected system to deliver performance. Second, looking at the nature and scale of the underlying physical transformation helps design a feasible transition. In an energy system made up of thousands or millions, and in some cases billions, of individual assets, the transformation that would be needed is monumental. With such a massive scale-up, bottlenecks in the build-out of supply chains could lead to shortages of critical minerals and manufactured goods. Installing or building new low-emissions assets at the scale and pace needed may be similarly difficult if not planned for well. Third, and relatedly, applying a physical lens to different components of the energy system can highlight critical interdependencies, which similarly need to be factored into the design of a reliable and feasible energy transition. Fourth, understanding the physical properties and maturity of different technologies, and the nature of the physical transformation, also helps to shed light on their costs and therefore on the affordability of the transition. 1 It is also important to take a holistic view of the socioeconomic impacts of different transition pathways, and to use this to help inform decision making. See Climate Transition Impact Framework: Essential elements for an equitable and inclusive transition , McKinsey Sustainability, December 2023; and “ Solving the net-zero equation: Nine requirements for a more orderly transition , McKinsey Sustainability, October 27, 2021. Prior McKinsey research has highlighted the large scale-up needed in low-emissions capital spending and various challenges associated with the affordability of the transition. 2 See, for example, The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring , McKinsey Global Institute, January 2022; An affordable, reliable, competitive path to net zero , McKinsey Sustainability, November 30, 2023; and From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth , McKinsey Global Institute, September 2023. While costs associated with the transition are not the core focus of this research, appreciating  the physical realities of the transition is crucial to better understand cost challenges. For example, in the case of carbon capture technologies, expanding their use to new use cases would require deploying them in processes where CO 2 makes up a small portion of the gases that are emitted (that is, is present in lower concentration in flue gases) and is therefore harder to capture. This could be about three times more expensive than the cost of capture of higher-concentration use cases deployed today. 3 See chapter 7, Challenge 24. The massive physical scale-up of the assets needed for a new system could also lead to shortages of raw materials and, as a result, contribute to price increases and create volatility. In 2022, prices of cobalt, lithium, and nickel surged, leading to an increase in the price of batteries of nearly 10 percent globally. 4 Energy technology perspectives 2023 , IEA, January 2023; IEA clean energy equipment price index, 2014–2023 , IEA, September 7, 2023; and Trends in electric vehicle batteries , IEA, April 2023. A sharp drop in prices quickly followed. This volatility generated uncertainty that contributed to the postponement of new mining projects. 5 Thomas Biesheuvel, “Battery metal price plunge is closing mines and killing deals,” Bloomberg Law, January 9, 2024; and Aya Dufour, “Some minerals are ‘critical’ to the digital economy, but current prices don’t reflect that,” CBC News, March 4, 2024. Thus, a physical lens brings focus on not just how to achieve emissions reduction feasibly but also to do so while ensuring affordability, maintaining the reliability of the energy system, and thus also securing the competitiveness of companies and economies—three other objectives that McKinsey research has identified as vital for a successful transition. 6 An affordable, reliable, competitive path to net zero , McKinsey Sustainability, November 2023. This research primarily uses the 2023 McKinsey Achieved Commitments scenario, not as a forecast, but to understand the physical challenges to overcome. 8 This scenario assumes that countries that have committed to net zero (some by 2050, some later) meet those commitments and that warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. See Global energy perspective 2023 , McKinsey, October 2023. Other net-zero scenarios may contain slightly different combinations of technologies and rates of deployment, but the broad trends and themes described in this research would still apply. This report is based on analysis as of September 2023. Subsequent developments in the energy system may lead to different outcomes, which will be covered in forthcoming McKinsey research. Under this scenario, billions of low-emissions assets—for instance, about one billion EVs, over 1.5 billion heat pumps, and about 35 terawatts of low-emissions power generation capacity—would need to be deployed by 2050 alongside scaling supporting infrastructure such as the grid, EV charging stations, and supply chains (Exhibit 1). Image description: A stacked area chart shows that primary energy consumption grew steadily from 1990 to 2022. Fossil fuels accounted for about 80 percent of the total in 2022. Other non-fossil fuels accounted for most of the rest, and variable renewable energy (VRE) had a very small but growing presence. On the right side, two line charts show energy system emissions have not started to decline, with a six percent increase from 2012 to 2022. But emissions intensity, measured in million tonnes of CO2 per exajoule of primary energy consumption, decreased by 7 percent over the same period.At the bottom, a Gantt chart shows the 2022 deployment of low-emissions technologies as a share of their needed 2050 deployment in each of 7 domains, or sectors. The 2050 deployment needs are based on the McKinsey 2023 Achieved Commitment Scenario, in which most countries reach their net-zero commitments by or before 2050. In the power sector, low-emissions installed capacity is at 8–12 percent of its needed 2050 deployment. In the mobility sector, deployment has reached three percent of its needed deployment for electric vehicles (EV) stock and 15 percent of its needed deployment for EV sales. The industry sector has reached 0–10% of its needed deployment for low-emissions production of steel and cement. The buildings sector has reached 5–7 percent of its needed deployment for heat pump stock and 9–12 percent of its needed deployment for heat pump sales. The raw materials sector has reached 10–35 percent of its needed deployment for the supply of critical minerals. The hydrogen and energy carriers sector has reached less than one percent of its needed deployment for the production of low-emissions hydrogen. Finally, the carbon and energy reduction sector has reached less than one percent of its needed deployment for CO 2 capture by point-source facilities.Overall, the charts show that the energy transition is at an early stage. End of image description. Recent years have seen momentum on many—but not all—fronts. For instance, about 90 percent of all battery EV sales and almost 60 percent of solar and wind power capacity added was in the past five years. 9 Global EV Data Explorer , IEA, April 23, 2024; Renewable capacity statistics 2023 , International Renewable Energy Agency, 2023. But overall, the transition is in its early stages. Deployment of low-emissions technologies is currently only about 10 percent of the levels required by 2050 in most domains—and largely in comparatively easy use cases. While some areas like solar have grown rapidly, others have not. In cases such as low-emissions hydrogen, carbon capture, and low-emissions primary production (excluding recycling) of large industrial materials, less than 1 percent of required deployment by 2050 has been achieved thus far. Abating about half of energy-related emissions depends on addressing the hardest of 25 physical challenges To progress the transition further, 25 physical challenges—defined as barriers to switching from high-emissions physical assets and processes to low-emissions ones—across the seven domains would need to be addressed (Exhibit 2). Image description: An hexagon chart presents 25 physical challenges that must be addressed for a successful energy transition, categorized by domain. The challenges are grouped into three levels, according to the level of difficulty of addressing them. Level one challenges require deploying established technologies that face the least physical hurdles. Level two challenges require deploying known technologies to accelerate and scale them. Level three challenges occur when technological performance gaps meet demanding use cases and the transformation is just beginning. The challenges are arranged in a honeycomb pattern. The first domain is the power sector, with six challenges: managing renewables' variability (level 3); scaling emerging power systems (level 3); flexing power demand (level 2); securing land for renewables (level 2); connecting through grid expansion (level 2); and navigating nuclear and other clean energy (level 2). End-Use Sectors include three domains: mobility, industry, and buildings. Mobility challenges include driving battery electric vehicles (BEVs) beyond breakeven (level 1); going the distance on BEV range (level 1); loading up electric trucks (level 3); charging up EVs (level 2); and refueling aviation and shipping (level 3). The challenges in the industry domain are furnacing low-emissions steel (level 3); cementing change for construction (level 3); heating other industries (level 3); synthesizing low-emissions ammonia (level 3); cracking the challenge of plastics (level 3); synthesizing low-emissions ammonia (level 3); and heating other industries (level 2). Challenges in the buildings domain include facing the cold with heat pumps (level 1); and bracing for winter peaks (level 2). The last three domains are categorized as enablers. They are: raw materials, H2 and other energy carriers, and carbon & energy reduction. Raw materials include one challenge: unearthing critical minerals (level 2). H2 and other energy carriers include harnessing hydrogen (level 3); scaling hydrogen infrastructure (level 3); and managing biofuels footprint (level 2). Carbon and energy reduction challenges are expanding energy efficiency (level 2); capturing point-source carbon (level 3); and capturing atmospheric carbon (level 3). End of image description. Some challenges are harder to address than others, and they have been categorized into three levels of difficulty based on technological performance, interdependencies across different challenges, and scaling needs: Three Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Ten Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Twelve Level 3 challenges have technological performance gaps and interdependencies, and are early in their transformation. Eliminating between 40 and 60 percent of the energy system’s CO 2 emissions depends on addressing Level 3 challenges (Exhibit 3). Image description: A donut chart shows the share of direct and indirect emissions in 2022 that are associated with Level 3 challenges, which are defined as the most challenging physical aspects of the energy transition. The chart shows that Level three challenges account for 40–60 percent of total emissions from the energy system. The chart further shows that the power domain is responsible for about 40 percent of the emissions associated with Level three challenges, while mobility and industry contribute about 20 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The challenge levels are based on the McKinsey 2023 Achieved Commitment Scenario, in which most countries reach their net-zero commitments by or before 2050. End of image description. Download the full report for an in-depth review of each domain and associated physical challenges. Each domain faces physical challenges The research looks at physical challenges in seven domains (see sidebar, “Scope and methodology”). Click on each domain name to go to the chapter in the full report. Scope and methodology This research focuses on understanding the physical challenges of the energy transition. Important methodological choices were made to do this. The focus is the energy system, encompassing both production and use (including the current use of fossil fuels as feedstock for industrial processes). The system accounts for more than 85 percent of current CO 2 emissions. 1 Global CO 2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes total about 37 gigatonnes, with about five gigatonnes in agriculture, forestry, and other land use. In the case of methane, more than 35 percent of global emissions arise from the energy system, from combustion and industrial processes, with the remainder split between agriculture at about 40 percent and waste and other sectors at about 25 percent; McKinsey EMIT database, 2023. Sources of emissions outside the energy system, including in agriculture, forestry, and other land use, are not included. Other important sustainability topics, including the preservation of natural capital and the impact of pollution beyond greenhouse gas emissions, are also not within scope. In each domain of the energy system, the analysis explores what physical asset and process transformations would be required when switching from high-emissions assets to low-emissions alternatives. Examples include switches from fossil-fuel-based power generation, such as coal power plants, to low-emissions sources like variable renewable energy in the form of solar and wind, and clean firm power like nuclear or hydropower in the power domain; from ICE vehicles to EVs in the mobility domain; and from gas boilers to low-emissions heat sources in industry or buildings. The associated infrastructure and supply chains that would need to be built to support these switches are also analyzed. Based on these transformations, the research then identifies 25 physical challenges that must be addressed for CO 2 emissions of the energy system to be reduced while replicating the performance of the existing energy system. These challenges were identified in consultation with more than 50 industry experts and academics within and outside McKinsey alongside an extensive literature review of analysis of the energy system. 2 This includes reviews of the level of progress in clean technologies and associated challenges by McKinsey and others. Among other research, see, for instance, Hauke Engel, Mekala Krishnan, Hamid Samandari, Humayun Tai, Daniel Pacthod, Simran Khural, and Mackenzie Murphy, A sector progress tracker for the net-zero transition , McKinsey Sustainability, November 2023; Energy technology perspectives 2023 , IEA, January 2023; Tracking clean energy progress 2023 , IEA, July 2023; Net zero roadmap: A global pathway to keep the 1.5ºC goal in reach , IEA, September 2023; World energy transitions outlook 2023 , International Renewable Energy Agency, 2023; Systems Change Lab data dashboard, accessed May 2024; Climate change 2022: Impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability , Contribution of Working Group II to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, 2022; ETP Clean energy technology guide , IEA, updated September 14, 2023; The state of clean technology manufacturing , IEA, May 2023; New energy outlook 2023 , BloombergNEF, 2023; Global critical minerals outlook 2024 , IEA, May 2024; The state of clean technology manufacturing , IEA, May 2023; Material and resource requirements for the energy transition , Energy Transitions Commission, July 2023; and Better, faster, cleaner: Securing clean energy technology supply chains , Energy Transitions Commission, June 2023. The 25 challenges are prioritized based on the potential of new, low-emissions technologies to abate emissions. Some exclusions help bound the scope of the work. First, challenges that are expected to affect only a small portion of total emissions are not included. Second, incremental improvements to existing assets that do not involve major switches in technologies are not directly discussed as individual challenges; two examples are improved ICE fuel efficiency and insulation in buildings. Nevertheless, their collective impact is recognized in Challenge 23. Third, as noted, the challenges focus only on the energy system; those related to the transition of agriculture and other land use are not discussed directly, although the role of land as a physical challenge is discussed as part of the power domain challenges. Fourth, the focus is on challenges of a physical nature; any challenges that are purely related to market adoption or policies are excluded. Fifth, this research does not explicitly cover challenges related to labor. Finally, since this work focuses on analyzing the physical realities of the transition, costs are not the main focus, although, as noted, physical realities can help shed light on cost challenges. The choice and precise boundaries of the 25 challenges is subjective to a degree, and some challenges are broader in scope than others. Different taxonomies, granularity, or segmentation of some challenges would certainly be possible. For example, circularity and recycling are important cross-cutting challenges that are discussed in the context of individual materials, such as plastics and critical minerals, but they could be deemed challenges in themselves. The list of 25 is neither collectively exhaustive (as noted, a prioritization lens has been used) nor mutually exclusive (many challenges share interdependencies). The challenges are categorized into three levels, reflecting both the progress made to date in addressing them and the nature of the hurdles to overcome. Three features of difficulty, discussed further in chapter 3, are considered to do this: technological performance; gnarly interdependencies with other challenges; and degree of, and constraints on, scaling. In examining the 25 challenges, this research builds on existing analyses of the transition in three ways. First, the examination of the performance of individual technologies is done in the context of specific use cases rather than their technological maturity in general. Second, this analysis goes beyond assessing technological maturity to consider other physical challenges, such as the required scale-up of supply of critical minerals. Finally, it considers how the system as a whole interacts—including how a particular individual technology relies on others—and the implications of that interaction. Of course, the precise boundaries between the levels of challenges can be debated, and the classification into levels can vary by region. Parts of a Level 3 challenge could be categorized as Level 1 or 2. For instance, overall, decarbonizing cement is a Level 3 challenge that requires substantial technological innovation, but some decarbonization approaches, such as using biomass for heating or deploying clinker substitutes, are already widespread in some markets. A global view of challenges is taken, but deployment of different technologies varies among regions. Some challenges may be more or less important—and difficult—depending on the region. Across challenges, the research looks at the required deployment of low-emissions assets in 2050, comparing it with today’s levels using McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario. 3 This research uses the 2023 McKinsey Achieved Commitments scenario because it provides detail across different economies and types of assets about the deployment levels that would be required for those economies to meet the climate commitments they have made. The scenario assumes that countries that have committed to net zero (some by 2050, some later) meet those commitments, and that warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. See Global energy perspective 2023 , McKinsey, October 2023. Other net-zero scenarios may have slightly different combinations of technologies and rates of deployment, but the broad trends and themes described in this research would still apply. In some instances, this research also uses insights from other external scenarios for reasons of data availability. Among the external sources of data used in this report are publicly available data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris, namely Energy technology perspectives 2023 , IEA, January 2023; and Net zero roadmap: A global pathway to keep the 1.5ºC goal in reach 2023 update , IEA, September 2023.

This holds true for all providers of the data that went into our analysis. We gratefully acknowledge their input, but the conclusions and any errors are our own. Understanding the physical challenges can help CEOs and policy makers navigate the transition Making progress on the transition requires understanding physical challenges. If the most demanding challenges are to be addressed, performance gaps would need to be confronted. Innovation of technologies, such as improving the energy density of batteries and developing more efficient hydrogen electrolyzers, would need to continue and be scaled. Broader system-level changes would also be needed—shifting the way technologies mesh together. For instance, the potential increased variability of low-emissions power supplies could be balanced by making demand for power more flexible and using gas peaker plants as backup power. Even the way energy and materials are consumed could be adapted. For instance, alternative materials could replace industrial materials that are difficult to decarbonize. It would be important to consider how to ramp down the old system and ramp up the new one smoothly, and what investments could both support today’s energy system and lay the groundwork for tackling future emissions and physical challenges. Examples include investing in energy efficiency, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and considering the role of “hybrid” technologies, such as hybrid passenger cars to address vehicle range issues. CEOs and policy makers both have a role to play in tackling physical challenges. Their plans for the way forward could be calibrated by carefully considering challenges across the three levels: For Level 1 challenges, how can near-term opportunities from the deployment of fast-maturing technologies be captured? For Level 2 challenges, what bottlenecks need to be addressed today to unlock the next tranche of opportunities? For Level 3 challenges, where and how can these hardest challenges be addressed? The physical transformation of the energy system is complex and difficult, and the path forward uncertain. What lies ahead is a new energy transition on a monumental scale that would require setting a bold aspiration and proceeding with commitment and action. Above all, understanding the physical realities can help navigate the way forward to success. Want to know more about the physical  realities of the energy transition?

Unprecedented adoption rates from companies across industries and sectors, as well as significant private investment, underscore this potential. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla , Alexander Sukharevsky , Ben Ellencweig , and Guilherme Cruz , with Carlo Palermo and Joshan Cherian Abraham, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey and McKinsey Digital. Capturing the value from technology, however, is never just about the tech alone. Companies looking to move beyond running gen AI experiments will need to rewire how they work to achieve the full value of their efforts. One key component of this rewiring is developing strategic alliances 1 A strategic alliance typically has broad and long-term impact on corporate performance and valuation, often formed to create a competitive advantage for the partners in their respective markets. Not all alliances need to be strategic; alliances can be established to achieve highly operational or tactical objectives and can include working with large hyperscale providers or more niche organizations. (This definition is adapted from the one created by the Association of Strategic Alliance Professionals. For more, see “Alliance management definitions,” Association of Strategic Alliance Professionals, accessed May 6, 2024.) with gen AI providers. The unique challenges of working with gen AI—from the lack of experience that many have in using the technology to gen AI’s instability and risk to the technology’s rapid pace of change—have made collaborations increasingly vital. While many companies are already working to some degree with gen AI providers, outdated notions of what to look for in a provider and how strategic alliances should function are putting these efforts at risk. To make the most of strategic alliances, companies should focus on three areas: Go deeper on collaboration As many companies are learning, the “build versus buy” approach to creating gen AI capabilities falls short when it comes to harnessing gen AI’s full potential. Building solutions entirely in-house can be time consuming and resource intensive, especially given the lack of gen AI talent at most companies. 2 “ The state of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s breakout year ,” McKinsey, August 1, 2023. And while buying existing gen AI products or services can provide quick access to proven solutions, these solutions often require experienced gen AI workers to customize them to what the business really needs. Collaborating with providers, on the other hand, can offer significant benefits in terms of access to the latest capabilities and expertise, development speed, and tailored solutions. But effective strategic gen AI alliances work differently from traditional vendor relationships. The technology is still rapidly maturing, implementation is complex, and stability issues bedevil solutions, requiring closer collaboration and higher degrees of trust. Sharing data to fine-tune models, for example, can happen only if client companies trust strategic allies to protect it effectively. Similarly, the complexity of addressing root cause issues in AI models, many of which are not yet fully stable, necessitates both clear lines of communication and alignment on resolution protocols. This level of trust and collaboration should be established on three essential building blocks: Cocreation of solutions. For most companies, the greatest value from gen AI will come from adopting established capabilities, which providers offer, and tailoring these capabilities to companies’ unique data. This requires a highly iterative and collaborative process where the company and provider work closely together to source and prepare the right data, engineer relevant prompts, fine-tune models based on specific use case needs, and test and iterate on the models in the field. To manage the range of providers a company might need to work with, it will be important to institute frequent touchpoints to share updates, discuss challenges, and align on priorities across providers. Dedicating time for in-person workshops and co-innovation sessions, celebrating milestones, and sharing learnings openly during this process is also critical for building trust. When a luxury retail company, for instance, partnered with a gen AI provider to create a personalized product recommendation system, the company shared its vast catalog of product information, including detailed specifications, features, and customer reviews. The company also provided valuable insights into the nuances of customer preferences and behaviors, such as how they pose queries. This helped the provider engineer relevant prompts, fine-tune the gen AI models to understand and interpret this domain-specific data, and comprehend the specific language, terminology, and attributes used to describe luxury products. This collaboration was instrumental in allowing the resulting model to surface the most appropriate products, even for complex or ambiguous queries, with over 99 percent accuracy. Early results indicate the solution could yield a 10 to 20 percent improvement in the conversion rate from product discovery to purchase, a significant leap for the luxury industry. Joint planning. It is essential for the gen AI provider to offer visibility into its product road map, including upcoming features and capabilities, and possibly grant access to alpha or beta releases. This allows the client company both to anticipate how the provider’s offerings might evolve to meet the company’s own future needs and to possibly influence the direction of the road map. The road map can also be aligned when the company shares its strategic goals and relevant customer insights to help the provider better understand the company’s needs. This level of communication and coordination is particularly important given that companies will likely be working with different gen AI models and applications—often developed by different providers—that need to be closely integrated for a solution to work well . Potential benefits of providing clarity and transparency include helping various vendors align their road maps and identify dependencies (for example, between multiple models that need to work together to deliver a specific gen AI solution). One area where we’ve seen big dividends is investing significant time together up front—often meeting every couple of days for two to four weeks—to work out a mutual road map and system dependencies. The output from this effort should include a primary project plan that captures milestones and dependencies between providers so the client company can better manage and coordinate all parties. One leading technology company adopted this approach. It engaged in joint planning sessions with its gen AI providers to identify high-impact use cases to strengthen its core product. The company shared valuable customer analytics insights and outlined its long-term vision for AI-driven innovation, which helped the gen AI providers develop a more aligned road map. For their part, the gen AI providers offered early access to new gen AI features and models, allowing the company to test and provide feedback before general release. Through these collaborative-planning efforts and continual communication about road map needs and adjustments, the company was able to reduce time to market for deploying at-scale solutions. For instance, it launched a personalized marketing campaign powered by gen AI within six months of starting the strategic alliance, resulting in a significant boost in sales conversions. Risk and investment sharing. Gen AI programs often require sizable investments in specialized hardware, large-scale data acquisition and tagging, and extensive computational resources for model training. In addition, the risks associated with adopting gen AI capabilities —from hallucinating models to privacy issues—require close attention. For these reasons, companies should consider how best to distribute among providers financial, technological, and operational resources and risks associated with gen AI development. Companies and providers, for example, should be explicit in defining specific risks associated with the gen AI project, such as data privacy breaches, model biases, or IP infringement. These agreements will ideally outline each party’s responsibilities for mitigating and managing these risks, as well as any financial or legal liabilities. The same technology company mentioned earlier shared risks with their gen AI providers by structuring contracts around outcomes instead of token usage. This approach allowed the company to manage uncertainties and costs while aligning incentives and fostering a shared commitment to success. Learn more about McKinsey’s strategic alliances capability Zero in on providers that offer scalability, interoperability, and reusability A single provider that can provide all the best components for an effective gen AI solution doesn’t exist, at least not yet. The variety of components and models needed to work together across the tech stack means that companies will need to team up with a curated network of specialized tech providers. In developing an ecosystem of providers that can scale, the component parts working together are more important than the parts individually. Companies need to weigh those criteria that enable the overall gen AI system to work most effectively. Selecting the right providers has become particularly challenging given the growth in the provider landscape. In fact, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of open-source large language models (LLMs) and commercial LLMs has quadrupled. 3 Sources included press search, Stanford University’s HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) leaderboard, and McKinsey analysis. Furthermore, there are currently more than 1,000 AI vendors, with more than 600 new products introduced over the previous year, mostly spurred by gen AI. 4 Maria Korolov, “Weighing risk and reward with gen AI vendor selection,” CIO, January 3, 2024. To that end, companies should zero in on three key criteria when selecting providers: These three criteria are crucial for selecting gen AI providers that can scale, but companies should also ensure that all providers meet a high bar on other criteria, such as ethical guidelines and adherence to local privacy and tech sovereignty regulations. Establishing and aligning around clear data governance and security protocols can go a long way toward building trust with providers. Stay in control of your destiny Finding the sweet spot between forging close strategic alliances and maintaining agency over the broader direction and vision of these collaborations presents a critical challenge for organizations. Companies looking to maintain independence and control of their destiny would do well to consider the following guidelines: Getting started As the transformative potential of gen AI continues to unfold, companies should act decisively to position themselves for success in this new era. To get started, executives can consider the following actions: Building trust and fostering collaboration are just as important as choosing the right technology. Companies should start small, learn fast, and iterate often to ensure that they are well on their way to unlocking the full potential of gen AI.

A structured approach to succession planning The dilemma When the founder CEO at one midsize oil and gas company originally announced his retirement, operations were solid, health and safety metrics were good, and the business was profitable. More recently, there were signs of decline in all those areas, and at least one of the newer members of the board viewed the CEO’s retirement as an opportunity to right the ship . A formal CEO search could bring fresh ideas and leadership into the organization just when it needed them the most, she thought. But the CEO had already chosen his successor: a senior executive whose career path and leadership style mirrored those of the outgoing CEO. The board didn’t see the point in engaging in a long, drawn-out process when there was a viable, hand-picked internal candidate in the picture. Instead, directors voted unanimously to confirm the retiring CEO’s pick to lead the company. Nine months later, amid cratering investor confidence, the board reconvened—this time to vote the new CEO out. The research One of a board’s most important tasks is to ensure the successful transition of power from one CEO to the next . Yet McKinsey analysis has shown that between 27 and 46 percent of executive transitions are viewed as failures or disappointments after two years. 1 Scott Keller, “ Successfully transitioning to new leadership roles ,” McKinsey, May 23, 2018. To succeed with succession planning, boards must recognize and address their—and potentially, the outgoing CEO’s—tendencies toward similarity bias . This occurs when individuals are inclined to evaluate more favorably or behave in a more positive manner toward people they perceive as sharing their own identities or other characteristics. Research has shown, for instance, that venture capitalists are more likely to evaluate an investment opportunity favorably if they believe the founding entrepreneur thinks in a way similar to their own. 2 Niek Strohmaier et al., “Similarity bias in credit decisions for entrepreneurs on the brink of bankruptcy,” Journal of Applied Social Psychology , July 2021, Volume 51, Number 7. One of a board’s most important tasks is to ensure the successful transition of power from one CEO to the next. The departing oil and gas CEO wanted to replace himself with someone who had similar priorities and philosophies, even if they weren’t what the company needed right then or might need in the future. Meanwhile the board of directors reflexively deferred to the founder CEO’s vision of what was required for success in the CEO role. They were exhibiting the representativeness heuristic rather than seizing an opportunity for organizational renewal . 3 Chengwei Liu, Dawn L. Eubanks, and Nick Chater, “The weakness of strong ties: Sampling bias, social ties, and nepotism in family business succession,” Leadership Quarterly , June 2015, Volume 26, Number 3. In the end, the oil and gas company managed to stabilize its performance, but only after installing an interim CEO to manage the company through a full CEO search and transition process—an incredibly disruptive and expensive course correction. Bias Busters The remedy A good old-fashioned task force , established by the board long before any executive departures are announced or even considered, can help depersonalize the succession-planning process. In this way, companies and boards can ensure that they’re getting or building the leadership talent that they need to keep up with their industry. In the case of the oil and gas company, forward-thinking board directors could have invited the CEO to join with other C-suite, business unit, and HR leaders to form a succession-planning committee. The committee members could have met regularly to review the CEO’s criteria for the ideal successor and mapped them against others’ criteria for identifying and selecting the most appropriate candidates (internal and external). They could have provided regular succession-planning updates to the full board. The CEO would still have had significant input in the process, but there would have been room for others, like the newly joined board member, to consider who might be the best leader for the organization given current and future business needs—and to suggest their own candidates. The task force could also have suggested possible development opportunities for likely internal candidates—job rotations, stretch assignments, and mentoring, for instance. All of this would have been less costly and less time consuming than simply going with the comfortable candidate. Rather than fear the inevitable CEO departures and having to start from scratch, companies and boards should be thinking about the next CEO as soon as the current one is hired.

Foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) can perform impressive feats, extracting insights and generating content across numerous mediums, such as text, audio, images, and video. But the next stage of gen AI is likely to be more transformative. We are beginning an evolution from knowledge-based, gen-AI-powered tools—say, chatbots that answer questions and generate content—to gen AI–enabled “agents” that use foundation models to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world. In short, the technology is moving from thought to action. About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world’s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Broadly speaking, “agentic” systems refer to digital systems that can independently interact in a dynamic world. While versions of these software systems have existed for years, the natural-language capabilities of gen AI unveil new possibilities , enabling systems that can plan their actions, use online tools to complete those tasks, collaborate with other agents and people, and learn to improve their performance. Gen AI agents eventually could act as skilled virtual coworkers, working with humans in a seamless and natural manner. A virtual assistant, for example, could plan and book a complex personalized travel itinerary, handling logistics across multiple travel platforms. Using everyday language, an engineer could describe a new software feature to a programmer agent, which would then code, test, iterate, and deploy the tool it helped create. Agentic systems traditionally have been difficult to implement, requiring laborious, rule-based programming or highly specific training of machine-learning models. Gen AI changes that. When agentic systems are built using foundation models (which have been trained on extremely large and varied unstructured data sets) rather than predefined rules, they have the potential to adapt to different scenarios in the same way that LLMs can respond intelligibly to prompts on which they have not been explicitly trained. Furthermore, using natural language rather than programming code, a human user could direct a gen AI–enabled\xa0agent system to accomplish a complex workflow. A multiagent system could then interpret and organize this workflow into actionable tasks, assign work to specialized agents, execute these refined tasks using a digital ecosystem of tools, and collaborate with other agents and humans to iteratively improve the quality of its actions. In this article, we explore the opportunities that the use of gen AI agents presents. Although the technology remains in its nascent phase and requires further technical development before it’s ready for business deployment, it’s quickly attracting attention. In the past year alone, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others have invested in software libraries and frameworks to support agentic functionality. LLM-powered applications such as Microsoft Copilot, Amazon Q, and Google’s upcoming Project Astra are shifting from being knowledge-based to becoming more action-based. Companies and research labs such as Adept, crewAI, and Imbue also are developing agent-based models and multiagent systems. Given the speed with which gen AI is developing, agents could become as commonplace as chatbots are today. What value can agents bring to businesses? The value that agents can unlock comes from their potential to automate a long tail of complex use cases characterized by highly variable inputs and outputs—use cases that have historically been difficult to address in a cost- or time-efficient manner. Something as simple as a business trip, for example, can involve numerous possible itineraries encompassing different airlines and flights, not to mention hotel rewards programs, restaurant reservations, and off-hours activities, all of which must be handled across different online platforms. While there have been efforts to automate parts of this process, much of it still must be done manually. This is in large part because the wide variation in potential inputs and outputs makes the process too complicated, costly, or time-intensive to automate. Gen AI–enabled agents can ease the automation of complex and open-ended use cases in three important ways: How gen AI–enabled agents could work Agents can support high-complexity use cases across industries and business functions, particularly for workflows involving time-consuming tasks or requiring various specialized types of qualitative and quantitative analysis. Agents do this by recursively breaking down complex workflows and performing subtasks across specialized instructions and data sources to reach the desired goal. The process generally follows these four steps (Exhibit 1): Art of the possible: Three potential use cases What do these kinds of systems mean for businesses? The following three hypothetical use cases offer a glimpse of what could be possible in the not-too-distant future. Use case 1: Loan underwriting Financial institutions prepare credit-risk memos to assess the risks of extending credit or a loan to a borrower. The process involves compiling, analyzing, and reviewing various forms of information pertaining to the borrower, loan type, and other factors. Given the multiplicity of credit-risk scenarios and analyses required, this tends to be a time-consuming and highly collaborative effort, requiring a relationship manager to work with the borrower, stakeholders, and credit analysts to conduct specialized analyses, which are then submitted to a credit manager for review and additional expertise. Potential agent-based solution: An agentic system—comprising multiple agents, each assuming a specialized, task-based role—could potentially be designed to handle a wide range of credit-risk scenarios. A human user would initiate the process by using natural language to provide a high-level work plan of tasks with specific rules, standards, and conditions. Then this team of agents would break down the work into executable subtasks. One agent, for example, could act as the relationship manager to handle communications between the borrower and financial institutions. An executor agent could compile the necessary documents and forward them to a financial analyst agent that would, say, examine debt from cash flow statements and calculate relevant financial ratios, which would then be reviewed by a critic agent to identify discrepancies and errors and provide feedback. This process of breakdown, analysis, refinement, and review would be repeated until the final credit memo is completed (Exhibit 2). Unlike simpler gen AI architectures, agents can produce high-quality content, reducing review cycle times by 20 to 60 percent. Agents are also able to traverse multiple systems and make sense of data pulled from multiple sources. Finally, agents can show their work: credit analysts can quickly drill into any generated text or numbers, accessing the complete chain of tasks and using data sources to produce the generated insights. This facilitates the rapid verification of outputs. Use case 2: Code documentation and modernization Legacy software applications and systems at large enterprises often pose security risks and can slow the pace of business innovation. But modernizing these systems can be complex, costly, and time-intensive, requiring engineers to review and understand millions of lines of the older codebase and manual documentation of business logic, and then translating this logic to an updated codebase and integrating it with other systems. Potential agent-based solution: AI agents have the potential to significantly streamline this process. A specialized agent could be deployed as a legacy-software expert, analyzing old code and documenting and translating various code segments. Concurrently, a quality assurance agent could critique this documentation and produce test cases, helping the AI system to iteratively refine its output and ensure its accuracy and adherence to organizational standards. The repeatable nature of this process, meanwhile, could produce a flywheel effect, in which components of the agent framework are reused for other software migrations across the organization, significantly improving productivity and reducing the overall cost in software development. Use case 3: Online marketing campaign creation Designing, launching, and running an online marketing campaign tends to involve an array of different software tools, applications, and platforms. And the workflow for an online marketing campaign is highly complex. Business objectives and market trends must be translated into creative campaign ideas. Written and visual material must be created and customized for different segments and geographies. Campaigns must be tested with user groups across various platforms. To accomplish these tasks, marketing teams often use different forms of software and must move outputs from one tool to another, which is often tedious and time-consuming. Potential agent-based solution: Agents can help connect this digital marketing ecosystem. For example, a marketer could describe targeted users, initial ideas, intended channels, and other parameters in natural language. Then, an agent system—with assistance from marketing professionals—would help develop, test, and iterate different campaign ideas. A digital marketing strategy agent could tap online surveys, analytics from customer relationship management solutions, and other market research platforms aimed at gathering insights to craft strategies using multimodal foundation models. Agents for content marketing, copywriting, and design could then build tailored content, which a human evaluator would review for brand alignment. These agents would collaborate to iterate and refine outputs and align toward an approach that optimizes the campaign’s impact while minimizing brand risk. How should business leaders prepare for the age of agents? Understanding the unique risks posed by agentic systems Large language models (LLMs), as we now know, are prone to mistakes and hallucinations. Because agent systems process sequences of LLM-derived outputs, a hallucination within one of these outputs could have cascading effects if protections are not in place. Additionally, because agent systems are designed to operate with autonomy, business leaders must consider additional oversight mechanisms and guardrails. While it is difficult to fully anticipate all the risks that will be introduced with agents, here are some that should be considered. Potentially harmful outputs Large language models are not always accurate, sometimes providing incorrect information or performing actions with undesirable consequences. These risks are heightened as generative AI (gen AI) agents independently carry out tasks using digital tools and data in highly variable scenarios. For instance, an agent might approve a high-risk loan, leading to financial loss, or it may make an expensive, nonrefundable purchase for a customer. Mitigation strategy: Organizations should implement robust accountability measures, clearly defining the responsibilities of both agents and humans while ensuring that agent outputs can be explained and understood. This could be accomplished by developing frameworks to manage agent autonomy (for example, limiting agent actions based on use case complexity) and ensuring human oversight (for example, verifying agent outputs before execution and conducting regular audits of agent decisions). Additionally, transparency and traceability mechanisms can help users understand the agent’s decision making process to identify potentially fraught issues early. Misuse of tools With their ability to access tools and data, agents could be dangerous if intentionally misused. Agents, for example, could be used to develop vulnerable code, create convincing phishing scams, or hack sensitive information. Mitigation strategy: For potentially high-risk scenarios, organizations should build in guardrails (for example, access controls, limits on agent actions) and create closed environments for agents (for instance, limit the agent’s access to certain tools and data sources). Additionally, organizations should apply real-time monitoring of agent activities with automated alerts for suspicious behavior. Regular audits and compliance checks can ensure that guardrails remain effective and relevant. Insufficient or excessive human–agent trust Just as in relationships with human coworkers, interactions between humans and AI agents are based on trust. If users lack faith in agentic systems, they might scale back the human–agent interactions and information sharing that agentic systems require if they are to learn and improve. Conversely, as agents become more adept at emulating humanlike behavior, some users could place too much trust in them, ascribing to them human-level understanding and judgment. This can lead to users uncritically accepting recommendations or giving agents too much autonomy without sufficient oversight. Mitigation strategy: Organizations can manage these issues by prioritizing the transparency of agent decision making, ensuring that users are trained in the responsible use of agents, and establishing a humans-in-the-loop process to manage agent behavior. Human oversight of agent processes is key to ensuring that users maintain a balanced perspective, critically evaluate agent performance, and retain final authority and accountability in agent actions. Furthermore, agent performance should be evaluated by tying agents’ activities to concrete outcomes (for example, customer satisfaction, successful completion rates of tickets). In addition to addressing these potential risks, organizations should consider the broader issues raised by gen AI agents: Although agent technology is quite nascent, increasing investments in these tools could result in agentic systems achieving notable milestones and being deployed at scale over the next few years. As such, it is not too soon for business leaders to learn more about agents and consider whether some of their core processes or business imperatives can be accelerated with agentic systems and capabilities. This understanding can inform future road map planning or scenarios and help leaders stay at the edge of innovation readiness. Once those potential use cases have been identified, organizations can begin exploring the growing agent landscape, utilizing APIs, tool kits, and libraries (for example, Microsoft Autogen, Hugging Face, and LangChain) to start understanding what is relevant. To prepare for the advent of agentic systems, organizations should consider these three factors, which will be key if such systems are to deliver on their potential: McKinsey’s most recent “State of AI” survey found that more than 72 percent of companies surveyed are deploying AI solutions, with a growing interest in gen AI. Given that activity, it would not be surprising to see companies begin to incorporate frontier technologies such as agents into their planning processes and future AI road maps. Agent-driven automation remains an exciting proposition, with the potential to revolutionize whole industries, bringing a new speed of action to work. That said, the technology is still in its early stages, and there is much development required before its full capabilities can be realized. The increased complexity and autonomy of these systems pose a host of challenges and risks. And if deploying AI agents is akin to adding new workers to the team, just like their human team members, agents will require considerable testing, training, and coaching before they can be trusted to operate independently. But even in these earliest of days, it’s not hard to envision the expansive opportunities this new generation of virtual colleagues could potentially unleash. We are celebrating the 60th birthday of the McKinsey Quarterly with a yearlong campaign featuring four issues on major themes related to the future of business and society, as well as related interactives, collections from the magazine’s archives, and more.

Leaders at today’s healthiest organizations don’t run them the same way that the C-suite did in 2003, when McKinsey launched the Organizational Health Index (OHI). About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Aaron De Smet , Arne Gast , Drew Goldstein , and Richard Steele , with James Rappaport and Nicolette Rainone, representing McKinsey’s People & Organizational Performance Practice. We created the index to help organizations gain vital insights into whether they have the right practices in place to drive sustained performance. In the two decades since then, OHI research has consistently shown that the best predictor of long-term performance is organizational health: how well organizations align around a common vision, execute their strategy, and renew themselves over time. Indeed, organizations scoring in the top quartile on health deliver, on average, three times the shareholder returns of those in the bottom quartile. 1 Corporate Performance Analytics and Organizational Health Index by McKinsey, 174 surveys, 2008–16; Scott Keller and Bill Schaninger, “ A better way to lead large-scale change ,” McKinsey, July 10, 2019. Healthier organizations are less likely to show signs of financial distress 2 Corporate Performance Analytics and Organizational Health Index by McKinsey, 28 surveys with 238,489 respondents, 2020–21; Dana Maor, Michael Park, and Brooke Weddle, “ Raising the resilience of your organization ,” McKinsey, October 12, 2022. or have safety incidents, 3 Organizational Health Index by McKinsey; Randy Lim, Jean-Benoît Grégoire Rousseau, and Brooke Weddle, “ The symbiotic relationship between organizational health and safety ,” McKinsey Quarterly , November 13, 2018. and are more likely to have employees who endorse their employer to friends and relatives. 4 Organizational Health Index by McKinsey, 14 surveys, August to December 2023. Yet technologies have advanced. Worker motivations have evolved. Leadership styles and power dynamics have shifted. And the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these changes and others. Since 2003, McKinsey has regularly upgraded the OHI to reflect advances in organizational science and changes in the state of organizations. In the latest upgrade conducted over the past year, we were struck by new organizational patterns that emerged. These insights led to the most substantial and numerous set of changes yet in the OHI , reflecting the most powerful modern predictors of health and, by extension, long-range organizational success. In this article, we discuss the six key shifts that emerged from the data and why they matter for leaders trying to build healthy organizations in a rapidly changing world. We were surprised that some of our predictions about what is and isn’t changing in organizational health weren’t supported. Or, if they were supported, the reasons were slightly different from what we had expected. We figured if our organizational science experts were intrigued, leaders would be even more so as they think about how to address change. The rules of the game are different The OHI measures organizational health through nine dimensions of organizational effectiveness, or outcomes: direction, leadership, work environment, accountability, coordination and control, capabilities, motivation, innovation and learning, and external orientation. We hypothesized—correctly, it turns out—that these outcomes would remain constant. About the research The latest effort to improve McKinsey’s Organizational Health Index began with surveying, interviewing, and conducting focus groups with more than 100 McKinsey practitioners and clients to understand what changes would be needed. We then conducted a multiphase research effort in 2023, with nearly 9,000 employees across the world participating, to validate survey questions for new concepts and refine those for existing concepts to ensure that the upgraded survey can be available for widespread use in 2024. Within each of those nine outcomes are a range of practices, or behavioral manifestations of how leaders run an organization, that drive overall health. For the latest OHI upgrade, we spent the better part of a year collecting data and testing numerous hypotheses (see sidebar “About the research”). We expected that we would expand current concepts and add several new ones, which led to the number of measured practices growing from 37 to 43 (exhibit). This process revealed several fundamental and dramatic shifts in the management practices that drive organizational health. In essence, the world has changed, and the OHI captured those changes, loud and clear. Predictions, affirmations, twists, and surprises Six shifts Practice tests: Some concepts were not supported, while others were partially supported. The six notable changes we observed were related to purpose, authoritative leadership, decision making, employee experience, technology and digital capabilities, and sustainability (see sidebar “Six shifts”). Our research also revealed actions leaders can take to adapt to these changes. 1. To create a common purpose, show your employees the ‘why’ We predicted that purpose would be added as a new practice driving direction, one of the nine outcomes, given how interest in purpose has increased in recent years. It was added, but we found that purpose also reflects an evolution of employee involvement. Thus, we combined employee involvement and purpose into one new fused practice: common purpose. In the past, employee involvement was about engaging employees in the “what” and the “how” of interpreting, evolving, and executing an organization’s strategy. Our new research found that this involvement can be shallow and transactional when it isn’t tied to a deeper sense of purpose and meaning. At the same time, organizational purpose can fall flat when employees can’t tie it to what they do and why they do it every day. To make this connection, organizations should start with the “why,” or the underlying purpose of the organization. No matter what the organization does as a business, it’s critical to articulate why it exists and the contribution that employees make through their work. Why it matters: Articulating a common purpose helps connect people emotionally and intellectually to an organization’s direction. Strategic plans may aim for 15 percent annual revenue growth, but that’s not a metric that resonates with people. In a rapidly changing world, leaders can motivate their workforces if they offer a North Star that helps guide them. For example, Asian insurance company AIA’s purpose is to help millions of people live “a healthier, longer, better life.” 5 “Welcome to AIA,” AIA, accessed on July 23, 2024. This purpose connects the daily work employees do with protecting the well-being of those they serve. By eliciting the right behaviors from high-performing talent , the insurer reinforces its business strategy of delivering sustainable, long-term results and creating value for all stakeholders. When an organization emphasizes a common purpose, employees are afforded more discretion to carry out their tasks. They feel empowered to use their judgment (and know where to draw boundaries) because they understand not only what the organization wants to achieve but also why it does so. Common purpose is a strong predictor of organizational health. Organizations that emphasize common purpose are 2.4 times more likely than those that do not emphasize this practice to effectively set a clear direction and 4.1 times more likely to be healthy. 6 McKinsey OrgHealth Refresh Survey, 3,940 English-speaking employees across the United States (2,068 participants), the United Kingdom (525 participants), Canada (519 participants), Australia (433 participants), and Singapore (395 participants), conducted from May to July 2023. This is further supported by academic research finding that organizations where employees reported both purpose and clarity around the direction of the organization saw 7.6 percent higher risk-adjusted stock returns over time. 7 Claudine Gartenberg, Andrea Prat, and George Serafeim, “Corporate purpose and financial performance,” Organization Science , January–February 2019, Volume 30, Number 1. This shift in favor of purpose may become even more important given the increasing percentage of younger workers who rank meaningful work above compensation when asked why they decided to stay at their current job. 8 Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and Bill Schaninger, “ Gen what? Debunking age-based myths about worker preferences ,” McKinsey, April 20, 2023. 2. Authoritative leadership is obsolete Authoritative leadership—using authority, pressure, and influence to get things done—has been practiced in organizations for decades, as anyone who has held a job knows. It has also been a fixture in our survey from the outset, and we predicted that it would remain a practice that drives leadership. But in one of the biggest changes we’ve seen in the OHI, our prediction was not supported. Authoritative leadership does not predict organizational health and no longer appears in our OHI model. The benefits from this concept are already more effectively covered through other leadership practices, including being empowering and decisive—two new practices we did add to the OHI: To be clear, decisive leadership is not a rebranding of authoritative leadership; the data show that they are very different. 9 Correlations among decisive leadership and various refinements of authoritative leadership in our survey panel ranged from 0.29 to 0.32. Concepts were determined to be distinct when correlations were lower than the proportion or percentage of variance explained by a regression was between 0.80 and 0.90, consistent with guidelines for assessing discriminant validity in Mikko Rönkkö and Eunseong Cho, “An updated guideline for assessing discriminant validity,” Organizational Research Methods , January 2022, Volume 25, Number 1. For leaders displaying these other traits, being authoritative confers no additional measurable benefit. Why it matters: Authoritative leadership is no longer an effective way to get things done. For decades, the normative view was that there was a time and a place for authoritative leadership. Previous data tended to say that being directive and putting top-down pressure on people to get things done was necessary in some situations and that too little of it was bad for the organization. The new data tell us that there is no situation in which leaders need to follow the old maxim “Do it because I said so.” 10 Aaron De Smet, Arne Gast, Johanne Lavoie, and Michael Lurie, “ New leadership for a new era of thriving organizations ,” McKinsey Quarterly , May 4, 2023. In this era of disruption, leaders can be challenging and decisive while being supportive, consultative, and empowering. But badgering people, micromanaging them, and applying positional authority to pressure people to do more and do better is no longer effective compared with alternative ways of leading, and it doesn’t drive organizational health. That’s a big change at the top, with profound consequences for the whole organization. 3. Navigate uncharted territory with facts and data, not intuition We predicted that decision-making effectiveness and efficiency would make up a new practice driving the outcome of coordination and control. It turns out that decision-making excellence, while crucial, is not one new practice but several practices working together to drive organizational health. These include the new practices of empowering and decisive leadership, plus the addition of data-driven decision making. Data-driven decision making refers to basing business decisions on hard data rather than relying on intuition or personal experience. Although we expected this practice to align with the coordination and control outcome, we found that it more strongly predicted innovation and learning. That makes sense: innovation is about the art of the possible and data are about predicting the future. The business world is moving at a faster pace and there is more data-based knowledge swirling out there. Even the most experienced leaders can’t rely only on intuition in this environment or just trust their gut when it comes to innovation, because they don’t have pattern recognition for what’s truly novel. But using good data and facts creates an accurate feedback loop that can lead to innovation. Why it matters: An unbiased approach to change makes organizations better at innovation. Organizational leaders are successful people who often believe their intuition has helped them get where they are. Yet when in uncharted territory, intuition can keep leaders anchored on the status quo —or in the past. Before jumping into decision making, it’s critical to first identify and gather the necessary data. The fact that there are so much data out there means that if leaders aren’t careful, they may cherry-pick metrics to tell the story they want to tell. In that case, what looks like data-based decision making really isn’t. Instead, they can agree on the right metrics up front to ensure that the insights gathered do not confirm an existing bias but rather uncover previous blind spots and remedy them. A level of alignment, clarity, and transparency is crucial before data can effectively guide decisions that lead to innovation. Healthy organizations demonstrate proficiency at rapid-fire innovation by launching a test or piloting a program and using data to tell them if what they’re doing is working. A data-driven feedback loop helps them get faster and better at innovation. This is a notable organizational shift: modern, healthy organizations use data to inform how they innovate and learn over time. 4. Help employees be at their individual best every day In the latest update, we asked whether the OHI should include a third aspect of organizational health, beyond outcomes and practices: employee experience . We hypothesized that measuring employees’ perceptions of their own well-being and productivity would be useful as a reflection of a new organizational emphasis that goes beyond satisfaction and engagement measures. At the same time, we believed this measure was unlikely to add any incremental value beyond management practices in predicting organizational health. This prediction was not supported because the data show that employee experience does add unique value in driving organizational health. For example, career-related employee experience concepts add unique value beyond talent-related practices in predicting health. The OHI model now includes a new employee experience section that reflects employees’ sense of well-being, commitment, and professional growth. Why it matters: Organizations that create the conditions for employees to thrive are the ones that retain and attract talent. As organizations use automation and AI (including generative AI) to handle routine tasks, people’s work will involve higher levels of cognitive and social–emotional skills. These skills, which include judgment, creativity, and collaboration, mean that people will need to thrive, not just avoid burnout . To address this profound shift in how work gets done, organizations can move away from treating employees as cogs who hit their deliverables to using an artists-and-athletes model, which inspires people to produce at the highest levels. This was not part of organizational health previously, but it’s becoming more important to retain and attract the best talent. People need to be at their best to do their work, but what that means is different for everyone. Employee experience is more than engagement ; it is an individual experience. It includes how employees feel about their jobs and the growth opportunities available at their organization; their well-being, including energy levels and burnout; and the purpose behind their work. For example, if an employee wants to start work at 4:00 a.m. because that’s their creative zone, the organization should seriously consider letting them do so. Not just because it will make the employee happier but also because it could make their work better. Happiness is a bonus. Questions that many organizations ask employees about their level of engagement tend to revolve around their supervisors and whether the employees receive recognition for their work. The new research indicates that the questions that matter focus on whether employees feel psychologically safe , whether they are getting the professional growth they want, and if they have found a sense of purpose in their work. People don’t just want career opportunities; they want to be able to customize a path for themselves. If they are used to customized shopping options, why shouldn’t they have that at work? This is new. And as it turns out, these facets of employee experience are highly predictive of health because they are not just good for workers. They also help organizations. Even a leader who is a hard-nosed numbers person should still care about creating an employee experience that helps people reach their full potential because that will also help deliver better numbers. 5. Spend on technology only when there’s a strong business case We predicted that tech and digital capabilities would be added as a new practice driving the capabilities outcome, focused on the role of technology in making work easier for employees. Our prediction was partially supported. We added tech enablement as a practice, but the focus is on how technology optimizes business performance. The data show that technology should not be focused on making employees happy, just as a distinctive employee experience reflects thriving in a role, psychological safety, and other factors. Investments in technology should be linked to the bottom line to drive health and business performance . Making work easier through technology is not as predictive of overall organizational health. Why it matters: Investing in tech and its enablement is a waste of resources unless it directly boosts business performance. Many organizations invest in technology and tech enablement for better employee or customer experience, thinking that if they create a better experience, employee and customer loyalty will follow. The research shows that if this investment isn’t supported by a solid business case, it’s not worth doing. Leaders should ruthlessly prioritize tech enablement in furtherance of the organization’s business strategy, including capabilities and platforms. Some technology that helps people do their jobs better will also help the bottom line. But some won’t. What our research shows is that leaders should figure out which is which. They should tie tech to a business case or some aspect of performance that is financial or tangible beyond the fact that employees like it. This might seem surprising. Why wouldn’t an organization do something that makes employees happy? What we find is that if employee happiness is the sole reason to offer a particular tech tool, it might waste a lot of money. Instead, there should be a clear understanding of how the technology enables value creation and drives efficiency gains. These improvements can boost productivity and, as a result, contribute to employee happiness. 6. Act responsibly We predicted that sustainability would be added as a new practice driving external orientation. We were right that sustainability is important for organizational health, but the concept is too narrow. The research shows that what employees really want is a broader concept of social responsibility. Employees want to know that their organization is doing its part to make the world a better place by acting responsibly . 11 “ From there to here: 50 years of thinking on the social responsibility of business ,” McKinsey, September 11, 2020. Organizations emphasizing social responsibility are 1.9 times more likely to respond effectively to competitors and have high customer loyalty, and they are 3.3 times more likely to be healthy. 12 McKinsey OrgHealth Refresh Survey, 3,940 English-speaking employees across the United States (2,068 participants), the United Kingdom (525 participants), Canada (519 participants), Australia (433 participants), and Singapore (395 participants), conducted from May to July 2023. This practice, together with government and industry relations, allows for a more comprehensive view of how the organization engages with government and community groups. These issues should no longer be viewed exclusively through the lens of compliance; rather, social responsibility and sustainability should be recognized as strategic and operational imperatives . 13 Aaron De Smet, Wenting Gao, Kimberly Henderson, and Thomas Hundertmark, “ Organizing for sustainability success: Where, and how, leaders can start ,” McKinsey, August 10, 2021. For example, Decathlon, one of the world's largest sporting goods retailers, views social responsibility as core to its operations, treating its efforts with the same level of importance as financial performance . 14 “ Entrepreneurship at all levels: How Decathlon innovates for the future ,” McKinsey, April 26, 2023. Why it matters: Employees are looking for organizations to take a stance on social responsibility. The Edelman Trust Barometer has shown decreased trust over the past ten years in organizations headquartered in global powers. At the same time, people see these businesses playing a critical role in society, trusting them more than other institutions, including government and media, to integrate innovation into society. 15 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer: Global report , Edelman Trust Institute, 2024. Workers of all ages place a new emphasis on how organizations show up in the world, indicating that social responsibility will only grow as a central factor in organizational health. How leaders can think about building a healthy organization First, it’s important to avoid leadership don’ts. Those who refuse to adapt to new ways of leading risk harming their organizations. Those who don’t engage employees in a common purpose to empower them or who define social responsibility narrowly risk the same. Making these paradigm shifts and others requires a refreshed understanding of an organization’s strengths and how they tie into its aspirations. Once this new baseline is established, leaders can support the mindset shifts that are needed to implement the changes. This journey can begin with coaching leaders across all levels to address these shifts and ensuring that they reflect what the organization should be prioritizing. Change can be scary or exciting; it’s up to leaders to carve a path that allows the organization to embrace the future. Many of the practices and outcomes that have defined organizational health remain the same. However, changes in six areas—purpose, leadership, decision making, employee experience, technology, and social responsibility—strongly reflect the evolving dynamics we see occurring in the modern workplace. Leaders shouldn’t view addressing these six areas as optional. Rather, they should provide a leadership checklist for organizational health now. How leaders navigate these changes may well dictate whether their organizations simply survive or truly thrive.

COP is an annual meeting where member states of the United Nations convene to assess progress in dealing with climate change and make a plan for climate action within the guidelines of the UNFCCC. (The formal name for the meetings is the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or the United Nations Climate Change Conference.) The first COP was held in Berlin in 1995. Last year’s COP28 was held in Dubai. Get to know and directly engage with senior McKinsey experts on COP.

COP decisions indicate a level of global consensus. That’s because in the UN system, large and powerful countries like the United States and Russia have the same voting rights as tiny island nations like Vanuatu or São Tomé and Príncipe. Plus, decisions are made only by consensus. UN member states send representatives to participate in the negotiations. Observer organizations also send delegates, and industry representatives and lobbyists attend as well.\nBut before we dive any further into COP—including its triumphs and challenges and what to expect from this year’s conference—let’s provide some background. Learn more about McKinsey’s presence at COP . What are greenhouse gases? Greenhouse gases are naturally occurring gases, such as CO 2 , methane, and sulfur dioxide, that trap heat on Earth—like a greenhouse traps heat to grow tomatoes in cold climates. According to NASA, without greenhouse gases, the average temperature on Earth would be 0°F (–18°C), rather than the much balmier 59°F (15°C) it is now. Introducing McKinsey Explainers : Direct answers to complex questions Around the mid-1700s, with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, humans started burning fossil fuels to support increasingly mechanized lifestyles. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And they’re not going anywhere anytime soon: CO 2 , which is the cause for about three-quarters of global warming, can take thousands of years to be fully absorbed. More greenhouse gases in the atmosphere means a warmer planet. What is a 1.5° pathway? Since the Industrial Revolution, the average global surface temperature has risen by about 1.2°C. Most scientists agree that an increase of 1.5°C is the threshold beyond which the effects of climate change would be the most dangerous and irreversible. A 1.5° pathway is a plan to keep the average global temperature increase below that level. At COP26, in 2021, governments agreed to focus on a 1.5° pathway rather than the less stringent 2° pathway established under the Paris Agreement in 2015. To limit global warming to 1.5°C, every part of the global economy would need to rapidly decarbonize . Many companies, countries, and organizations have pledged to decarbonize, or make the net-zero transition, in the coming years. Learn more about McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice . What is net zero? A net-zero gain of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would be achieved when annual greenhouse gas emissions are equal to the amount removed each year. The pathways to net zero , identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, involve both decarbonization and carbon removal. Decarbonization is the reduction of carbon and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieved by reducing the use of high-carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Carbon removal solutions remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it over the long term. To achieve net-zero emissions, decarbonization would need to happen across all sectors, including energy, agriculture, and land use. And carbon removal would be needed to offset residual, hard-to-abate emissions from industries such as cement. What are the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement? The Kyoto Protocol, ratified in 1997, was a landmark international treaty in which signatories agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent human interference with the natural climate. The treaty, a result of COP3, was one of the most significant results of the COP meetings. In 2012, the agreement was extended to 2020. The Paris Agreement, also known as the Paris Climate Accords, is an international treaty negotiated in 2015 at COP21. In Paris, participants agreed to limit the increase of global temperatures to 2°C while pursuing efforts to stay within 1.5°C. According to the agreement, each country must track, record, and report its carbon emissions and its efforts to reduce and offset them. Learn more about McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice . What happened at the last COP? COP28, held in Dubai in 2023, was a significant moment. McKinsey delegates in attendance at COP28 reported progress toward decarbonization . But much more ambition is needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Delegates to COP28 made pledges on behalf of member countries: full delivery of the energy-related pledges made at COP28 would result in global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 being about four metric gigatons less than would be expected without the pledges. There are two challenges here. First, member states need to convert pledges to measurable action in order to achieve their goals. Also, four metric gigatons is nowhere near enough to limit warming to 1.5°C; reductions totaling 22 gigatons are needed to achieve this goal. COP28 concluded with what’s become known as the UAE Consensus . Part of this agreement included the goal of “transitioning away from all fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, in this critical decade to enable the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in keeping with the science.” This sentence is notable because it’s the first time the phrase “fossil fuels” has been mentioned in a COP agreement. The agreement was nonbinding, and 19 countries have committed to fund an agreement to mitigate climate loss and damage, with $792 million pledged. COP28 featured the first global stocktake , which provided a comprehensive assessment of progress since the Paris Agreement. The objective of the stocktake is to align efforts on climate action, including measures to bridge the gaps in progress. What were the key takeaways from COP28? Based on our conversations with executives, government leaders, and official delegates at COP28, here are ten key takeaways for leaders to help accelerate progress toward a net-zero transition and achieve energy sustainability: Learn more about the outcomes from COP28 . What is COP16? There’s another COP you might have heard about: the UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The first of these meetings, COP1, was held in 1994 in the Bahamas. The next meeting, COP16, will be held starting on October 21, 2024, in Cali, Colombia. The most recent biodiversity conference, COP15, was chaired by China and met in Montréal in 2022. This COP was the largest-ever conference on biodiversity: nearly 20,000 leaders and representatives—a marked increase from the fewer than 4,000 who attended the previous edition, in 2018—adopted a landmark agreement to protect natural capital and limit biodiversity loss around the world. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework provides the following targets , among others: Moving forward, the UN Biodiversity Conference will meet every two years.

Lynch Publisher: McGraw Hill (March 14, 2024) Language: English Hardcover: 208 pages ISBN: 1264277482 In this edition of Author Talks , McKinsey Global Publishing’s Raju Narisetti chats with Karen S. Lynch, president and CEO of CVS Health, about her book, Taking Up Space: Get Heard, Deliver Results, and Make a Difference (McGraw Hill, Winter 2024). Lynch discusses the benefits of leading with authenticity, overcoming adversity, and drawing on past experiences to reshape the future. An edited version of the conversation follows. You can also watch the full video at the end of the article. Why did you write this book at this time? The reason I decided to write this book is that tomorrows are never promised. My husband encouraged me to write the book, and it was a long process. But when we discussed it, we talked about the journey that I’ve been on in my leadership, how I started my life. We both agreed that I had stories and leadership lessons to share. If I just inspired one person who breaks through barriers, dreams big, and doesn’t let their past define their future because of my book, I would feel satisfied. The book’s title is deeply personal to you. I chose the title because [of an experience] when I was very young in my career. I’ve lived my entire career with that memory. I walked into a room, and I asked a gentleman where I should sit. He said, “You should sit in the back of the room, because women just take up space in a boardroom.”  This was in the ’80s. Clearly there were not a lot of women in leadership positions. I worked in public accounting, and there was one woman senior partner. I could’ve taken that [comment] and turned it into a negative. I walked into a room, and I asked a gentleman where I should sit. He said, ‘You should sit in the back of the room, because women just take up space in a boardroom.’ Instead, I turned it into an “I’ll show you,” and a very positive mantra around resilience and optimism. I think for every one of us in our career, someone says something that could be a setback. It’s really about how you choose to respond to anything kind of negative that gets put in front of you. I decided to choose a positive perspective, and really used that negative comment to fuel my passion and my commitment to do great things. When I was deciding the name of the book, we thought this was appropriately fitting, because it’s not just about taking up space. It’s about letting others take up space as well, and using your voice and letting others use their voice. I talk a lot about that in the book. I hope to encourage not just women but everyone to use their voice and take up space as they embark on whatever journey they set forth in their life. This is a book about life lessons applied to leadership. No one is perfect in their career journey, and everyone makes mistakes. It’s about how you address those mistakes and how you use those mistakes to learn. One of the things that I hope people take away is that you need to be a constant life learner. You get to learn from every part of your life. I talk in the book a little bit about a time my husband and I were doing a cattle drive in Montana. I talk about the lesson I learned from that: you don’t cattle drive from the front. You cattle drive from the side and from behind. The best leaders really guide and navigate from the side and let their people shine in front of them. I share those kinds of things so that people can think about their own experiences and gain insights into how they might approach their life and their journeys. You don’t cattle drive from the front. You cattle drive from the side and from behind. The best leaders really guide and navigate from the side and let their people shine in front of them. There’s a lot of vulnerability in that book. The first two chapters were incredibly hard to write. I shared painful mistakes I made. But one of the things I want people to really take away is that you don’t have to be special. What you have to be is consistent and disciplined and get up when you get down. People are going to knock you down, and perhaps you’re going to knock yourself down. It’s about how you get up from those [situations], how you take those experiences, and then use them to learn what you want to do next. You see a clear difference between managing and leading. Managing is just doing the rote tasks, and leading is establishing where you want to go. But it’s also about looking around the corners through the crisis and when the crisis is over. You can get through the crisis of managing the day-to-day activities. Leading through a crisis means rallying an entire group of people to overcome the crisis and come out even better on the other side. I’ve managed and led a lot of different crises in my career. Leading is listening to what’s happening on the front lines, not knowing that you think you have all the answers. But it is about getting the organization rallied around a common purpose and getting people excited about the possibilities of the future. Because in many, many instances, no matter what crisis you’re leading, the opportunity is to come out better afterward. The COVID crisis is a really good example. We came out stronger as an organization after that. But we could’ve just managed vaccines. We looked at how we could be a bigger part of an individual’s healthcare journey. How do we take our learnings, really change and transform healthcare, and use our company to do it? Leading through a crisis means rallying an entire group of people to overcome the crisis and come out even better on the other side. What drew you to a career in healthcare? The early interactions with the healthcare system in my life were twofold. I lost my mom to suicide when I was 12, then my aunt, who took in all four of us—I have two sisters and a brother—died when I was in my mid-20s. Both of those experiences had a profound impact on me and on how I interacted with the healthcare system. I truly learned that people didn’t really combine physical and mental health . I learned that access to mental health isn’t readily available. It wasn’t then, and it still isn't now. We have a long way to go, but we’ve made tremendous strides. I learned sitting at my aunt’s bedside that I didn’t know the answers. I didn’t know what questions to ask. So I am passionate about giving people choices, giving people education. Those all fuel my passion. But it doesn’t have to just be in the healthcare industry. You could be passionate about anything that you want to do and any career path that you choose—anything that you do—whatever it is in your life that you’re interested in. I think people, when they find that passion, use it to fuel their energy to really make a difference. People often forget that individually, we can make a difference. Collectively, we can make a difference. You asked early on what some of the lessons were. I hope that people take away that as a lesson: one person can make a difference. Use your voice. I talk about this a lot in my book, about using your voice and letting others use theirs. We all have the opportunity to be passionate about what we do and to truly make a difference. Why is mental health so important? We’ve done a lot at CVS Health and at Aetna to really improve and broaden access to mental health resources. We’ve enhanced our telehealth capabilities. We’ve put social workers in some of our MinuteClinic locations. We’ve expanded our EAP [employee assistance program] services. I had the opportunity to create impact and use my position to augment CVS. As a result of the pandemic, we saw a huge increase in mental health challenges and a huge issue relative to access. We’ve been working on that for a few years. As a country, [mental health] is something that has to be top of the agenda for us as we transform healthcare. More and more children are suffering from mental health issues . We’re seeing increases in suicides across the nation. And we are seeing mental health access challenges across the nation as well. So, as a country, [mental health] is something that has to be top of the agenda for us as we transform healthcare.  And I believe that more and more people are focused on it, and more and more people are talking about it than ever. What are some of the healthcare challenges consumers face in America? It’s complicated. I talk about how healthcare is hard. We have to make it simpler, and we have to make connections for people. You go to one doctor, and your information is not connected to that next appointment. It’s a confusing system, and it’s an expensive system. What CVS is really embarking on is to connect the dots for people in their healthcare journey so that they have the information available to them when and where they need it. We can meet you in the communities. We can connect with you digitally. At the same time, as a company, we have the ability to finance your care, to provide pharmacy benefits to you, to provide care in certain situations, and then connect you to your prescriptions and your consumer wellness products, making it much more simplistic and easy to navigate. Now, are we there? No. We have a journey ahead of us. I firmly believe there are two things that will help healthcare in the future. One will be technology. We’re seeing significant advances in technology to really support the underlying fundamentals of healthcare. I think value-based care has to play an important role here, because we really need to drive value, versus transactions, in the healthcare system. Then, we have to make sure that we’re having people engage. What we have found is that when people engage in their healthcare, we see better outcomes and improved health for individuals. How can leaders stay connected to their communities? It’s important to stay connected with your colleagues. I make it a point to stop in stores and engage in dialogue. I make it a point to pick up the phone and call individuals. Customers email me, and I respond to them. It’s important to keep your pulse on what’s going on in your company. With consumers and with customers, it’s easy not to [do that]. So you have to really stay connected, and you have to make it a point to do that. I have found that I usually get the best information while walking into a store or walking down the hall and having a conversation with colleagues, asking a few questions—and having a genuine interest in what’s going on. If you meet with me, I usually ask you these questions. One is, how’s a consumer going to interact with us—what’s the impact on the consumer? And how will that impact our colleagues? Those are two fundamental questions that make people really think about the process, the products, the services that you put in place. What is your approach to coaching and feedback? We’ve all been on the other side of feedback, when you’re getting all that positive [input]. Then there’s the negative. Our job as managers or leaders is to really coach people to their top performance. Think about athletes. Athletes have coaches for everything to sharpen their skills. That’s how we have to think about our colleagues. Giving them coaching feedback is really intended to sharpen their skills and make them even better. It’s not to be hurtful, and it’s not to give negative feedback. It’s really to have them sharpen what they’re trying to do. Now, the flip side, which I also talk about in the book: feedback is a gift. I always tell people that feedback’s a gift; coaching is a gift. You can choose whatever you want to do with it. Try it on, see if it fits. If it doesn’t, you don’t have to do it. But our job as leaders and managers is to help people achieve their goals, be it the next promotion or being the best individual contributor they can be. And it is their choice on which direction they want to go. Our job is to help coach and guide them to be the best performers they can be. Why is authentic storytelling so impactful? I wasn’t good at it at the beginning of my career. I think the point about storytelling is an important one; it needs to come from that genuine, authentic self. I don’t share a lot personally and didn’t share a lot personally. Now, it’s all in a book. But the first time I shared a story was [when] I talked about my mom and how she died. I hid that my entire life, because I thought people would hold that against me. I was in fear that people would say, “Oh my god, this is what happened to her. She’s not going to be good at anything. And what if she is a problem?” I remember sharing that story onstage unscripted, unplanned. The feedback was overwhelming. There was one particular woman who reached out to me immediately and said, “My son just died by suicide and I haven’t told a soul. I’ve been suffering from that, and you made it OK.” Being authentically you makes you a more authentic leader. Leadership is about followership. Are people willing to follow you? They’re going to follow you when they believe in you and they trust you. You don’t want to share every story and everything. But here I was, standing on stage trying to drive an entire new health strategy connecting emotional well-being with physical well-being. How am I going to get people to lead if I don’t feel whole? So I took a chance. And what I learned was—and I still learn to this very day—that everyone has a story. It doesn’t have to be that kind of personal story. Once you start talking about it, people are more willing to talk about it. That's a relief to them. Being authentically you makes you a more authentic leader. Leadership is about followership. Are people willing to follow you? They’re going to follow you when they believe in you and they trust you. That’s where authenticity really matters. Are men and women leaders perceived differently? It’s an interesting question, and it’s an interesting standard. I’ll share my experience. I also talk about this in the book. Not that long ago, I sat across a table from people who were evaluating me for a position. The feedback I got was, “Hey, you’ve got great leadership; the numbers are off the charts. But you don’t look the part. You’re not tall enough. You’re petite. Your voice isn’t deep enough. And you wear pink.” I’m not sure they would say that to a man—maybe they would. But those are experiences where we can be held under a different microscope. I share those experiences so that people know that it isn’t just them. At the end of my book, there’s a website where  you can write comments and share your stories. I have been overwhelmed by the stories that people have been sharing with me—both men and women. I think they feel better when they know that there are more people out there who are having similar experiences. And they know it’s OK to keep fighting the good fight, to stand up when you’re knocked down, and to keep forging ahead to pursue your dreams. I say this all the time: don’t ever let anyone define you. And don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t. How does it feel to be a first-time author? Writing a book wasn’t on my bucket list. As I said earlier, if it just helps one person aspire to do great things, or it just helps one person get up when knocked down, or if people look at their mistakes and do not let those get in their way, I’m happy. I am donating all the proceeds of this book to not-for-profit foundations that support mental health and female empowerment. I’m hopeful that people will buy it and read it. Sometimes people come up to me in the oddest places and say they have the book highlighted and it’s on their desks. I’m happy if it helps just one person. Visit Author Talks to see the full series.

Inspired to create a memorable experience, he orchestrated a surprise: when the family returned to their room after dinner, they found a chocolate lily pad with two chocolate coquí frogs perched on it and a note from “Coquí” himself waiting on the bed. The family was delighted by this thoughtful, fun gesture. This story raises questions about the potential of delight in customer engagement. Can delight be measured, managed, and institutionally delivered? What is the economic payoff for businesses? But, to start with delight itself: delight occurs at the intersection of customer joy and surprise. In the past, customer delight was restricted to elite brands due to perceived high costs. However, thanks to technological advancements and a shift toward customer-centric practices, companies now have smarter and more effective methods to deliver delightful experiences that yield long-term returns. Our Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice has done extensive research to uncover the profound impact of customer delight on business success. Surveying 25,000 customers across diverse industries such as tourism, insurance, and banking, we have discovered compelling evidence: delight not only cultivates loyalty and repurchase but also fuels revenue growth through cross-selling and up-selling opportunities. In this article, we cover the key findings of the survey, which reveal a clear advantage for companies that prioritize delight. Our research revealed that they outperform their competitors in key metrics such as net promoter score (NPS), revenue, and total return to shareholders (TRS). By prioritizing customer delight and implementing smart, sustainable strategies, companies can unlock new frontiers of service and drive lasting returns without incurring prohibitive expenses. To have a successful customer interaction, however, both the rational and emotional aspects of customer experience must be addressed. For example, if you are taking a ride in a cab, you expect to reach your destination. If you arrive before the anticipated time, chances are that you will be satisfied with the experience. Meeting customer expectations and satisfaction continues to be mission-critical—they are both vital elements in customer experience before delight can happen—but to elevate the experience, delight is needed; delight has the power to amplify retention, referrals, and revenue of satisfied customers. Delight: The sweet nexus between joy and surprise Before exploring the impact of delight, it is important to understand the science behind it. Delight is a deep, emotional reaction characterized by joy and surprise, stemming from an experience that provides something unexpected and extraordinary, transcending daily life. 2 Robert Plutchik, Theory of Emotion , Academic Press, New York, 1980. Delight occurs only at the intersection of joy and surprise (Exhibit 1). Surprise unfolds in four stages. First, we freeze, stunned by the unexpected, and we pause. Second, we try to comprehend the reason for the surprise. Third, we shift; the surprise alters our perspective as we uncover something new. Fourth, we experience joy and are so delighted that we feel compelled to tell others about our encounter. Although surprise tends to be short-lived, it has a disproportionate impact on how well we remember it—the hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores information, is activated when people experience surprise. As a result, our brains retain more details about this event than in an average moment. 3 Vanessa van Edwards, “The ultimate list of emotions and how to control your emotions,” Science of the People, August 2023. Joy, conversely, is the more intuitive, happy, emotional reaction. Combine it with surprise and the magical moment of delight emerges. And, delight is distinct from satisfaction. Satisfaction is a rational, cognitive response to a service performance or experience based on previously held expectations. If a company just about meets a customer’s expectations, the person is neutral or has no reaction. When expectations are exceeded, the customer is satisfied. And, when something unexpected happens on top of satisfaction, the customer becomes delighted. Delight your customers and they’ll keep coming back for more Advocates of customer delight have recognized its potential to forge strong emotional connections and drive desirable business outcomes for a company, such as referrals, retention, and revenue, which all can lead to loyalty (Exhibit 2). Our customer delight research showed consistent and significant unlocks across sectors, geographies, and product types. Referrals: Our research revealed an impact on referrals, which reinforces the notion that satisfaction is a vital foundation of customer experience. When customers are not satisfied, delighting them is helpful but does not, and cannot, help fully recover the loss. However, our findings also showed that satisfied customers who experienced delight, versus those who didn’t, had a significantly higher intention to recommend the brand to others, implying that delight is a great amplifier of loyalty. The NPS amplification impact of delight on satisfied customers was significant across different sectors—28 points in tourism, 18 in insurance, and 15 in banking (Exhibit 3). Retention: The impact of delight on reusage intentions was 25 percentage points and is evident across other industries. Customers who had a distinct memory of delight during their travel experiences were approximately 19 percentage points more likely to revisit the destination. We witnessed 25 percentage points in banking with regard to reusage intentions (Exhibit 4). Revenue: There were clear links to value for those who were both satisfied and delighted. Customers who were satisfied and experienced delight tended to cross-sell (buy additional products), up-sell (buy products at a higher price) and were less prone to down-sell (downgrade a product when the price is increased). For example, we noticed 30 percentage points in banking, 11 percentage points in insurance, and 15 percentage points in electric power and natural gas (EPNG) in cross-sell. Given that these activities are directly linked to value, it was possible to calculate an approximate link to the value that moments of delight created. Our research showed that, in insurance, if companies delighted a significant portion of their customers who were already satisfied, this could lead to additional revenue of 8 to 12 percent—translating into several billion euros a year. More broadly, we noticed that companies differentiating basis customer experience also witnessed their revenue growth double . Uncover the drivers of delight We have seen that delight can deliver significant value—so what are its biggest drivers? Through our research, we developed a large database of moments of delight mentioned by customers and analyzed them to understand the type of experiences, triggers, and longitudinal impact of different types of delight drivers. At the most basic level, we found that the majority of delight drivers falls into two categories—service excellence (intangibles) and product innovation. Within these areas, wherever expectations are high, the bar for delight becomes even higher. Service excellence We found that genuine, authentic human interactions that lead to personal connections usually result in significant customer delight. Courtesy and kindness create a break from transactional interactions, sparking moments of delight. Take, for example, a barista who learned American Sign Language to be able to deliver a consistent experience to a differently abled customer. Or, imagine if a cab driver had a preset “menu” to offer customers (for example, essential items such as beverages and snacks, or backseat gaming) that would lead to a positive emotional impact, causing delight. And, as many basic interactions now move to digital, self-service channels, the remaining employee or frontline interactions become even more important—they form connections with customers in more authentic ways and bring the human touch to experiences. As an example, take a customer who, when referring to his interaction with a call center employee, said, “The agent talked about their personal life, we laughed together and had a wonderful conversation.” This interaction created a personal connection for him. In another example, a US-based online pet retailer received a call from a grieving customer who wanted to return an unopened bag of dog food as her pet had died. The rep didn’t just give the customer a full refund but suggested she donate the food to nearby shelter, and sent her a personalized note of condolence. In these types of simple and inexpensive ways, companies can focus on creating environments and playbooks that promote personal interactions between customers and employees. In fact, as digital and cognitive assistants become more human-like, perhaps it is even possible that some of these delightful interactions may be delivered more authentically by digital agents in the future. Proactive service recovery is also a strong driver of surprise. Many hospitality companies know that guests who experience spectacular service recovery after facing an issue often rate their stays even higher than satisfied customers who have not encountered problems during their stays. This learning is applicable to other sectors as well, such as banking or insurance. When a service break occurs, most customers have a rational level expectation of what recovery should look like. But brands that significantly supersede that expectation of recovery, or do it in unexpected ways, can generate surprise and create promoters out of detractors. Product innovation Tangibles beyond people-driven moments strongly contribute to delight. Unexpected sensory experiences—especially multimodal ones—trigger joy and surprise, while participation and personal indulgence amplify this effect. For example, airlines enhance the first-class customer experience by engaging all five senses with delicious food, signature perfumes, aesthetically pleasing cabins, relaxing music, and comfortable furnishings. Innovative and novel products or features can also lead to delight—such as an insurer that disrupted the industry when it paid out a claim within seconds. Personalized tokens of appreciation can help companies stand out from the competition, specifically for customers with high expectations. From our research in insurance, customer verbatims revealed drivers of delight—for instance, one customer told us, “The representative came to our appointment with flowers for me and a bottle of wine for my husband as a thank you for our years of loyalty.” It is important to note, however, that gifting done at scale can add significant cost to a company, which is why driving delight has typically been regarded as expensive and unsustainable by some companies. Yet, as seen through our research, when done selectively with high-value customers to maximize personalized customer value, it can be powerful. And, a simple upgrade to an existing product may not be joyful for most people but may deliver exceptional joy to some—making it vital to understand each customer’s core emotional and functional needs and deliver against them to create a sense of ambassadorship. Three ways to stoke the delight engine To be able to constantly drive positive value from delight, companies need to establish a structured and sustainable delight engine—one with approaches that continually measure, design, and deliver delight at the right moment to the right person to generate positive returns. Through our research, we have identified three key levers that companies could use to create an effective delight engine. Measure delight and its value Companies first need to understand the moments of delight that resonate with various customer segments. Here, a mix of qualitative and quantitative research can help uncover what causes delight in a particular industry and along which customer journey. A robust delight measurement system that captures the intensity of joy and surprise across the customer journey can help qualify moments of delight. This further needs to be paired with incremental value measurement driven by delight across the journey, as well as the longevity of the incremental value received through various types of delight interventions. This method can ensure that investment is focused in areas with the highest return potential. In our research, we found that a single moment of delight at the correct time in the right customer journey can increase loyalty and intent to spend for up to six to nine months after the delight experience. By tracking the impact of delight interventions on key business outcomes such as loyalty, cross-sell, up-sell, and retention, companies can continually refine their delight interventions to create exceptional customer experiences and value. Match design to experience Designing unforgettable experiences isn’t solely a creative endeavor—it requires a design methodology that focuses on optimizing surprise and joy. Designing emotion-provoking moments for each target segment calls for a design methodology that has a deep understanding of customer emotions and triggers, followed by the curation, testing, and refinement of delight interventions that induce those emotions. These interventions can be significant, such as differentiating product features, or be micro-interventions such as a handwritten apology or appreciation note. The design of delightful customer experiences could be embedded in a company’s capability building and culture change initiatives. As those who interact most with customers, frontliners could be empowered to embrace the change—particularly as digital transactions increase and customers look for more meaningful human interactions. Disney, for example, is well known for consistently delighting people of all ages and under varying circumstances. It instills in guests a sense of joy and surprise through personalized encounters with Disney characters. What guests perceive as random and unexpected experiences of delight are, in fact, carefully choreographed by Disney. 4 Lauren A. Newell, “Happiness at the house of the mouse: How Disney negotiates to create ‘the happiest place on earth,’” SSRN, July 1, 2012. Take what is known as their “water art,” where they create magic while cleaning: this is a special kind of experience devised by the custodial team in which an employee, using just a broom and a bucket of water, draws favorite Disney and Pixar characters on the ground. Disney further embeds capabilities in its frontline staff for meaningful recovery during difficult moments. Deliver personalized delight micro-interventions through data and AI Companies can develop their own delight repositories—with major- as well as micro-interventions—that can be tapped into when needed to trigger the appropriate intervention at the correct moment for a specific individual. As we have shared previously in our Experience DNA article, the future of customer experience is holistic, predictive, and proactive, and this applies to delight, too. We believe that customer insights, in the age of big data, are a key reason why delight no longer needs to be an expensive proposition. In fact, data can be used to hyperpersonalize and prioritize delight-inducing micro-interventions for each customer, and can be delivered in a way that is sustainable, maximizing immediate ROI and customer lifetime value. After years of considering customer delight to be an expensive option, companies now have a real opportunity to reconsider and unlock its benefits, while being prudent and effective. No longer do they need to have customers who are solely satisfied—once delighted, their customers could be motivated to return, refer, and add value.

McKinsey’s latest tech trends research finds that only 11 percent of companies worldwide are using gen AI at scale. 1 “ Moving past gen AI’s honeymoon phase: Seven hard truths for CIOs to get from pilot to scale ,” McKinsey, May 13, 2024. Operations is a major gap: in a February 2024 survey of 150 executives at large North American and European companies, only 3 percent of respondents said their organization has scaled a gen AI use case in an operations-related domain . A separate survey, conducted in April 2024 of more than 250 corporate-function leaders worldwide, found that service operations is faring only slightly better. In finance functions, for example, about 45 percent of organizations are now piloting gen AI solutions, compared with 11 percent in 2023—but only 6 percent have achieved scale. The results reflect uncertainty among operations leaders about which of the many use cases they have deployed will yield real competitive advantage. Executives understand that realizing full value from their gen AI investments won’t be instantaneous: two-thirds of the April survey respondents set a three- to five-year timeline (Exhibit 1). But many also said that they wanted to be more confident that their commitments would pay off. One CEO recently told us, “We’ve already spent about $100 million funding hundreds of gen AI experiments; harvesting at least some of the value will help us see where additional investment will be worthwhile.” Companies also cited unclear road maps, talent shortages, and immature governance as further impediments to scale. A few companies, however, are capturing real value already, attributing more than 10 percent of their EBIT to their use of gen AI . 2 “ The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value ,” McKinsey, May 30, 2024. Out of 876 survey respondents who estimated the proportion of their organization’s EBIT that was attributable to gen AI, 46 gave a figure of more than 10 percent. Early successes like these reveal three critical tasks in setting gen AI up for scaling across an organization. The first is to design a cohesive, disciplined operational strategy for deploying gen AI. That means prioritizing use cases for long-term value by focusing on their potential to not only transform specific process points or domains but also reimagine complete workflows. About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world’s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Second, to sustain broad impact over time, companies will need to focus on the enablers supporting the humans who make gen AI work—providing the necessary governance and performance infrastructure while also investing in change management and a continuous innovation culture. The third task is the culmination of the first two: thoughtfully integrating gen AI tools with human capabilities to create the most advanced solutions, such as autonomous gen AI agents or copilots. The most successful can tackle every step of a complex workflow. At one bank, for instance, a gen AI agent now drafts credit-risk memos, increasing revenue per relationship manager by 20 percent. And a copilot in the finance department of a consumer goods maker is reducing operating expenses relating to financial planning and analysis by between $6 million and $10 million. Deploying operational gen AI strategically As with earlier waves of technological change, gen AI raises the specter of pilot purgatory, in which dozens of experiments fail to amount to sustained impact. Organizations that have already built up their capabilities in deploying gen AI tend to see better returns on their gen AI investments over both the short and longer term. They especially excel at thinking through sequencing, with a focus on scalability and reusability so that they can reimagine entire chains of value creation. Building this sort of maturity in gen AI transformation is now essential, leaving companies little time to waste. Ideally, lessons from lower-risk, earlier applications of gen AI build critical capabilities that help higher-risk (and higher-reward) later applications succeed. Prioritizing use cases The experience of a global bank illustrates the benefits of deploying gen AI strategically. First, based on a detailed assessment of business impact and technical feasibility, it winnowed 23 potential domains for use of gen AI to just two: the contact center in its consumer banking unit and the know-your-customer (KYC) function for corporate and investment banking. Despite the apparent differences, the two domains not only showed high potential for gen AI impact but also shared a few commonalities, particularly for gen-AI-based knowledge extraction and synthesis. The same technologies could support customers looking for information and employees looking for internal documents, so that the underlying technology could be reused and scaled more effectively (Exhibit 2). To determine which of the two finalists would go first, the company applied an additional screen: risk. The confidential nature of the KYC function’s data made it a higher-risk target, so the bank started instead with the contact center. The final strategic decision concerned which use cases to deploy within customer care. Keeping “ability to scale” and “reusability” top of mind, the chatbot came out on top: it’s comparatively easy to implement, generates measurable outcomes, and helps build a foundation for similar use cases that extract and synthesize complex data . Within just a few weeks, the center’s fully designed use cases included a customer-facing chatbot. In just seven weeks of use, the new chatbot offered an improved customer experience, eliminating wait times for about 20 percent of contact center requests. Moreover, lessons from the contact center have formed a reusable foundation that the bank can adapt for the KYC function. Chatbots are now a component of a “smart, virtual agent” that guides relationship managers through a far more automated KYC process. The virtual agent can prepopulate client information into forms, determine which documents are required, validate data uploads, and follow up on any missing information. From point solutions to complete workflows As the bank example illustrates, however, the core operational question for generative AI isn’t “How could gen AI help me improve my current processes?” To “improve” a process often means addressing only a symptom rather than the underlying condition—for example, using gen AI to automate note-taking and action-item generation for meetings without considering why there were so many meetings in the first place. The core question is therefore much broader: “How could gen AI help me rethink my operations?” Answering it means reexamining each process as part of a larger workflow—and, in many cases, as part of a user or customer journey . Breaking barriers to better service. To illustrate the difference, consider the case of a leading North American telecommunications provider, whose use case prioritization exercise led it to focus on customer care. Rather than start by exploring how gen AI tools could improve particular process steps in care, the company stepped back, asking instead how gen AI could combine with traditional process improvement techniques and new talent to raise productivity within the customer care function overall. That shift in perspective led the company to reevaluate its customer journeys, starting with a traditional mapping of every touchpoint , from initial contact to final resolution. With the resulting flowcharts in hand, company leaders questioned each process step to see if it was overengineered or unnecessary. It considered the step’s effect on customer experience (such as increasing complexity or wait times) versus the potential risks from its elimination (such as increased fraud or security lapses). For example, after the company mapped out the journey of changing a phone number, one particular step surfaced as so complex and painful that the company gave customers the option to delegate it to staff in exchange for a fee. But because customers were reluctant to pay, staff would often guide them through the step—a costly alternative for the contact center. Once the company understood the reasons customers got stuck, it could design a self-service solution. In combination with other technologies, gen AI’s capabilities to provide detailed, automated guidance meant that the company could reduce average call length (and cost) while eliminating the fee entirely, improving customer experience (Exhibit 3). Deeper analysis into the root causes of customer pain points also revealed internal misalignments that the company needed to address before gen AI could provide a solution—such as when price changes set by the marketing team led to surges in customer calls that the care team couldn’t handle. Unaware of the changes, agents would transfer customers to other departments, often in multiple loops, leading the care team to provide deep discounts in hopes of retaining the frustrated customers. Accordingly, the company revamped its cross-functional workflows so that the customer care team could work with marketing to anticipate potential customer concerns and develop appropriate responses in advance. Leaders also reexamined the skills that service teams would need, developing new talent profiles (and associated capability building modules) that could evolve with the workflows. Changing the internal collaboration model set the foundation for a later, gen-AI-based self-service option, while analytic AI tools could optimize staff allocation to provide additional call center coverage. Freeing up employees’ capacity. Employee journeys were the final piece of the puzzle. The company analyzed every step of the agent experience, from logging in to resolving customer inquiries and completing tasks. This analysis involved streamlining processes and reducing the complexity of technology systems that agents had to interact with. The telecommunications provider also identified potential misalignments between agent incentives and customer needs, ensuring that agents were given incentives to prioritize customer satisfaction and resolution rather than simply handle a high volume of calls. By taking an integrated approach to workflow optimization as a part of critical journeys, the telecommunications provider achieved significant and lasting improvement in its customer care function, with gen AI building on a range of analog and tech-based improvements. Total call volume fell by about 30 percent, and average handle time by more than one-quarter, even as service quality improved: first-call resolution rates rose by ten to 20 percentage points. The (human) secret to scale As with previous technologies, gen AI’s full potential depends on its reaching scale throughout an organization. Few companies have reached this point. Their experience underscores the importance of four elements, all of which center on humans rather than technology. The first two elements provide critical guidance; the second two more directly change the way people work, with a particular focus on change management. Governance Successful deployment of gen AI can’t be ad hoc. This is due to not only gen AI’s well-publicized risks —from inaccurate training data for gen-AI-based tools to “hallucinations” that produce incorrect results—but also the tendency of the most advanced organizations (the ones generating more than 10 percent of EBIT from gen AI) to centralize their gen AI initiatives. Almost half of these high performers report centralizing compared with only 35 percent of other companies. The components of the governance structure help support rapid implementation and common standards (Exhibit 4). Clear decision rights are especially important for assessing gen AI proposals, supported by a transparent vetting process with well-articulated standards for each stage gate. Performance infrastructure, data, and analytics Modernizing performance infrastructure is crucial to accommodate gen AI’s changes to the work landscape. The first step is redefining metrics to reflect the company’s new operational strategy—and to allow leaders to see how gen AI itself is progressing across the organization. Such metrics can help the organization generate and sustain positive results. Next, a disciplined, stage-gated review process with clear go/no-go criteria separates the merely promising deployments from the ones most likely to be productive. Finally, with better measurement of productivity gains, customer experience improvements, and related outputs, companies can tailor coaching and training programs for human workers and interventions when gen AI’s performance lags. Change management It’s a truism that changing technology isn’t the hard part of transforming an organization—it’s changing how people work that’s hard. Early experience seems to show that this is even more true for gen AI, for which a good rule of thumb is “ for every dollar spent on model development, a company should plan to spend three dollars on change management .” Communication is the starting point. By providing updates on what to expect and addressing potential anxieties, organizations can promote future adoption and create a culture of understanding among employees. But even better than just speaking to staff is to listen: the expertise and knowledge they contribute can make the difference between robust, cost-effective gen-AI-based solutions and gen AI gimmicks with little impact. In parallel, upskilling and reskilling initiatives can help smooth the transition. Continuous innovation culture Celebrating successes and sharing best practices is especially vital with a new technology such as gen AI, where innovation cycles are short. Simply keeping abreast of the latest opportunity requires both effort and openness: it’s not a question of “buy versus build” but “buy and build,” continually reviewing what the market offers. Organizations can foster an environment where frontline workers feel empowered to contribute ideas, whatever their source—and where they feel free to reexamine assumptions about the potential role of partners and vendors in sourcing innovation. By encouraging continuous improvement through feedback and innovation, organizations can optimize the agent and customer experience while maximizing the value of gen AI. To illustrate, consider the case of a leading European media and telecommunications company. This organization embarked on a mission to industrialize and scale gen AI by 2024, with tangible benefits expected within another year. The company’s approach was not merely about chasing the latest tech trend; it was about empowering its workforce and transforming the customer experience. To bring its vision to reality, the company identified a high-impact use case: a gen-AI-powered copilot designed to equip customer service agents with faster and more effective knowledge retrieval during calls. Keeping agents informed and engaged was a top priority for the company, which hosted weekly working groups to gather qualitative feedback on usability and design. Additionally, quantitative feedback was collected through agent ratings of the AI-generated responses. “Office hours” provided a forum for questions and project updates, fostering a sense of ownership among agents. This transparency helped mitigate potential frustrations and ensured that agents felt invested in the success of the copilot—and led to substantial changes in design. The user-centric approach proved instrumental not only in refining the copilot but also in encouraging successful scaling. By including frontline agents early in the process, the company made sure that the solution solved real problems in current processes and improved customer service and agent experience. The end result was a 65 percent reduction in average handle time for agents in finding relevant knowledge. Honing gen AI’s cutting edge The most advanced companies are already combining tools, which can help overcome some of the limitations of the large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) technologies at the core of gen AI’s initial wave.\nIn particular, LLMs and RAG struggle with complex processes—but automating only part of a process, even at a high level of reliability, often doesn’t free enough worker time to create much benefit. Lack of cross-verification can leave LLMs and RAG prone to error. LLMs are also limited to text applications, while both LLMs and RAG using multiple data sources are expensive to build and scale. Finally, LLMs have only limited capabilities with quantitative analysis, making entire streams of value unreachable. By contrast, a multiagent system helps humans coach machines to perform complex workflows, often by augmenting models with human expertise. By recursively breaking down a process into smaller tasks until each task can be executed reliably, the multiagent corrects itself, improving the quality of the outcome. This approach has allowed a North American bank to transform its workflows for writing credit risk memos, a tedious and time-consuming task with little room for error. Relationship managers (RMs) would spend one to three days gathering data from a dozen sources (or more), analyzing multiple interdependencies, and, finally, writing a 20-page memo providing nuanced reasoning to support a lending decision. A multiagent system now automatically identifies the correct data sources, ingests up-to-date data, and integrates qualitative and quantitative insights that reflect the latest business rules and products. It cites the data sources for each assumption and provides the key rationale behind quantitative trends, while also generating insightful comments based on the data it has integrated, content from prior memos, the RM’s feedback, and human expertise. Credit decisions are now 30 percent faster, while RM productivity has more than doubled. Most important, revenue per RM has risen by 20 percent. Renewing gen AI potential With so many companies already investing in gen AI, the question isn’t where to start but how to find gen AI’s potential quickly—and start earning the rewards. For the 97 percent of companies that haven’t yet scaled gen AI in their operations, there’s an urgent need for focus. At the same time, gen AI technology is moving so quickly that companies can often find opportunity simply by reassessing where they stand on a two- to three-month cadence. Issues to consider include the following: With better performance, greater specialization, and increased accessibility, gen AI can revolutionize service operations across industries. A few judicious decisions now could help a company leapfrog its competitors in creating new and sustained value.
