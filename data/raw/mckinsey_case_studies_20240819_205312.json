Built by Facebook with help from Google, the cables could boost data capacity to southeast Asia’s largest economy by 70 percent. The project, which is still subject to government approval, would be a boon to Indonesia’s connected users, who are among the savviest in the region and beyond. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Today, the nation comprises the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in the world. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Telkomsel has been an engine of that growth. The world’s seventh-largest mobile operator and the largest in Southeast Asia, the mobile-communications provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable, inclusive digital economy for Indonesia’s nearly 200 million internet users. It has dramatically increased Indonesia’s broadband access, helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) digitize, and led the nation’s transition from 3G to 4G before becoming the first operator to launch 5G there in May 2021. Telkomsel has long recognized the value of continuous innovation. When it looked to ensure its platform would remain the primary way its customers engage with the world—and win a new generation of customers—the 26-year-old incumbent decided to embark on a big, bold transformation. A plan to transform The move wouldn’t be easy, but Telkomsel felt it had an obligation to its customers, who had come to rely on the provider’s ability to meet their digital demands. So the organization called on a cross-functional team of data-domain experts from QuantumBlack and venture builders, designers, and strategy consultants from Leap by McKinsey to initiate a large-scale digital program aimed at reinventing the way customers experience Telkomsel in daily life. As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel knew it had to engage and strengthen its relevance with Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer segment. The average data-hungry Gen Z consumer in Indonesia spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone, using it to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. The program was built on three core pillars. Telkomsel wanted to build a new data analytics platform to better understand its customers and drive personalization; create and launch new businesses to reach underserved consumers; and launch a new digital channel that would streamline and simplify the way customers engage with Telkomsel’s services. Understanding customers Telkomsel’s leaders knew that providing customers with the best products and services would require putting data to smart use. The company developed new analytics capabilities that allowed it to enhance customers’ experiences and start the journey toward hyper-personalizing its services. Telkomsel began by building a new platform that contains more than 9,000 data points for each consumer, which was fully modular and reusable across business units. This gave the company a single, near-real-time view of customer behavior that could be used to improve experience across the entire consumer journey, from marketing and customer service to network operations, back-office support, and more. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. They also moved from manual data uploads to automated data pipelines and quality checks, which improved data quality and speed, and enabled more accurate and faster decision-making. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. Every month, Telkomsel runs more than 50 analytical models, based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, to identify the right way to interact with their customers and offer them propositions that are most relevant to them. The move toward hyper-personalization has allowed Telkomsel to better tailor their offers for customers. Today, these services and offerings already account for 50 percent of the telco’s overall revenues. Creating value beyond the hype Launching new businesses As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel moved to engage and strengthen its relevance with new consumer segments. For instance, the company needed to enhance its relevance to those underserved by traditional home broadband infrastructure. They also wanted to reach Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer audience, which spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. In order to move at their desired speed, Telkomsel would need to launch new brands and value propositions, which would require them to embrace a different culture, agile ways of working, and a fit-for-purpose technological stack through new business-building. In the end, they launched two new brands. Orbit: Expanding connectivity for underserved segments Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. Even as Indonesia rapidly digitized, fixed broadband access was not uniform, with just 15 percent of households using it to get online. To provide wireless connectivity to those who lacked fixed broadband, Telkomsel built and launched a new business called Orbit, which provides customers with a home router that uses 4G mobile cellular services instead of fiber optics. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. It includes a mobile app to check usage, top up on data, and manage router settings, such as parental controls. Orbit has doubled its one-year customer acquisition goal, with more than 35 percent of customers joining from its referral program, a testament to its popularity and market demand. Today, Orbit is seeing 20 percent month-over-month growth. By.U: Reaching Generation Z Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. Telkomsel didn’t have the kind of brand association among the digital natives it wanted to serve and delight. A cross-functional team of product managers, customer design experts and venture builders developed, built, and launched by.U, an all-digital telco experience. The platform allows users to select a pre-paid SIM card that arrives at their doorstep, activate their number remotely, manage top-ups and quotas, make payments, and more. By.U was built at pace. The team created a series of social-media tests to observe click-through rates on certain features, which allowed the team to develop and tune the minimum-viable product quickly. When Telkomsel beta-launched the brand, they quickly had 30,000 customers join the waitlist. The brand reached its one-year customer acquisition goal in half that time. Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. And to help ensure innovation continued post-launch, the by.U team established an agile-organization structure. Simplifying and enhancing engagement The app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. The goal of Telkomsel’s third pillar could be simply stated: to make customers’ interactions with the company as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible. But it was complicated to achieve. Telkomsel already had a self-serve mobile app, and the team initially set out to make changes there to improve the customer journey. However, as customer expectations for what an app could do rose—digital payments and loyalty programs, for example—so did pressure on the app’s infrastructure. It soon became clear that there was more value to be had in starting fresh. Delivering a new app is always complex. In this case, a core technology transition to a micro-services-based architecture proved to be the unlock. It also meant shaping a rigorous product-development strategy and creating a new commercial strategy to encourage uptake. But it was all worth it. With the launch of the award-winning MyTelkomsel, the company was able to offer customers more transparency around their usage, going from SMS-triggered alerts to an immediate, real-time view, as well as provide personalized packages tailored to their needs. Customer experience around digital payments became seamless, while an ecosystem with digital-retail partners let Telkomsel customers redeem loyalty points for products. Elsewhere, gamification mechanics allowed customers to earn badges that qualified them for free data allowances. The app also enabled access to new digital services, including video and gaming, and easier access to e-payment options through services like LinkAja, GoPay, OVO, Dana, and ShopeePay. All of this meant serving customers in more dynamic, exciting, and tailored ways. Today the app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. All aboard: Recruiting digital talent to sustain innovation Telkomsel knew that technology was only one part of the transformation equation. Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform—no matter how powerful—would perform to potential or withstand technological evolution. They also saw the potential in this partnership to help cultivate digital skills in Indonesia’s workforce, strengthening a commitment to building a center of excellence for Indonesian digital talent. They launched a new, agile recruitment process to attract, onboard, and train 40+ of Indonesia’s strong digital talent across data science, software engineering, product ownership and UX design. This entailed a whole new talent management approach – reinventing employer branding, carving out career paths for new profiles like data engineers and translators, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling existing analytics professionals. Over the course of several months, Telkomsel hired candidates across 12 newly created digital and data analytics roles, and set up seven cross-functional agile squads to catalyze the adoption of new ways of working. The end-product was a data management platform and new businesses - made in Indonesia, for Indonesians, by Indonesians. Culture, capabilities, and resilience Inside the company, its most enduring returns may also be among its least tangible: An emerging culture of innovation and agility; new capabilities and competencies; a new confidence in taking bold leaps through new ventures; and a commitment to long-term, sustainable transformation. Such traits, for example, enabled Telkomsel to help its customers through COVID-19. They quickly ensured their customers had fully-remote, digital services at their fingertips, and they were able to offer new packages that were tailored to what their customers needed and could afford at any given time. The telco industry is essential to our modern economies, enabling nearly every facet of remote connectivity, from online meetings to e-commerce to telehealth. It’s a sector in which it can feel like there’s little room for failure—and perhaps not always enough room for innovation. Telkomsel’s story is proof that innovation is not just valuable but critical; and that it can pay off when an organization commits to transformation at every level. Its digital journey has touched the lives of hundreds of millions of Indonesians, through personalization at-scale to enhance the experience of all its customers, new brands tailored to its digital-first users, and a new app that adds convenience to customers’ daily lives.

Welders spend long hours on their feet and often work outside: on bridges, at race tracks, in oil fields, and other sites. Welding strains eyesight, the neck, and shoulders. Fumes are toxic and burns common. For 40 years, our Sweden-based design team has collaborated first with Speedglas and then with 3M to design, and continually improve, welding helmets. With every product cycle, the joint team started from scratch, reimagining and redesigning the helmets, with innovations that sometimes shifted the entire industry. Our partnership has helped to improve welders’ safety and comfort under dangerous and strenuous working conditions. It started in 1983 when a tiny company called Speedglas invented a new type of welding glass. It darkened automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc, freeing welders from having to constantly “nod” the shield up and down as they worked. Other innovations over the years included a device that pivots the shield up and back over the crown of the head, rather than resting at the forehead, easing neck pain. Internal padding that skirted pressure points, reducing headaches. A two-way fan system that improved breathability. A textile covering that captured stray glass crystals. A curved design for glass that extended peripheral vision. Our partnership has produced seven signature helmet designs, with accessories, which have won 11 international awards, including a 2021 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award , and are now sold in 60+ countries. But most importantly, our work together has helped to protect welders around the world . Our North Star How do you sustain a 40-year partnership and reinvent the same product in fresh, new ways, again and again? “From our first contact in the mid-80s, we realized that if we worked together we could do something exceptional for our end users: the welders,” reflects Anders Grönberg , the global portfolio leader of welding at 3M. An engineer and market economist by training, Anders has led the development of the helmets for 25+ years, since joining Speedglas in 1990, and then moving on to 3M when it bought the company in 2004. “This has been our common interest during all these years: That we fulfill their needs today and in the future. The fact that we have been successful has, of course, also strengthened the relationship.” When Speedglas was first invented, industries in Sweden were advanced when it came to personal protective equipment. “Organizations were very keen to take care of their users,” recalls Anders. “We got a lot of suggestions and improvements from welders. We took notes with paper and pen and would go back to the office, share the information, and it would grow from there.” “Our North Star has always been to do the research where the welders are most comfortable: at his or her welding bench,” explains Oskar Juhlin , a McKinsey Design alumnus who led the helmet design work from 1983 to 2019. “If you bring someone into a design workshop, office, or other synthetic area, they won’t be as straightforward as they would be in their own environment. We also welded in our own studios, so we could test out the designs ourselves .” Design matters We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design. Early on, it was a challenge to talk to welders about design; at the time it was typically understood to be a field concerned with aesthetics alone. “One guy told me ‘I don’t care about how it looks, as long as I like it,’” he remembers. “Many welders work on race cars. Well it was a different story when I said, ‘So it doesn’t matter what wheels you put on your car?’ Yes, it does! So, then design is important? We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design.” Over time, the customer base grew to include countries in Asia and the US, where customers were very interested in the helmet technologies and had ideas for improvements. “There were more regulatory requirements to fulfil, so user research expanded into a more formal system,” recalls Anders. “We also realized we had to look beyond the current moment and anticipate the welders’ future needs.” Today, a product road map guides the design planning from three to five years out, with the goal of introducing a new helmet model every two years. “The cycles are getting shorter as the technology is changing more quickly,” says Anders. How we work The typical product cycle begins with the R&D team at 3M presenting the newest technical capabilities to three our four McKinsey industrial designers.  Many have worked together for years. The designers will have a wish list of what they’d like it to look like, as well as new materials, textiles, and fabrics to consider. “You design the helmet with several design concepts, on paper, in computer, foam and clay models, exploring different shapes and trying out materials,” explains Emelie Hedén Edlund , a design director who specializes in color, materials, and finish —or CMF, as it’s known— and worked on the later models. “You touch it, feel it, and then you go back to the computer again. There is a lot of back-and-forth between digital and physical hands-on testing.” The design studio is located in a large converted missionary church in Stockholm, with workshops for sewing, foam and wood working, metal working, and welding. As the design phase unfolds, the joint teams meet in a series of workshops, sitting together for one or two days testing out new prototypes, splitting up to work separately and do homework, and then coming back together to validate new iterations. Then they go to the welders to try out the prototypes and confirm they are moving in the right direction. If so, they go on to the next stage: the critical step of ensuring that the helmet model can be manufactured in high volumes . Hans Nyström , associate design director at McKinsey, recalls one inspiring meeting. “The extended 3M team and our designers were at the table, discussing a very complicated prototype. And it was clear that it weighed too much. No one wanted to raise their hand and say ‘it’s my work that’s causing this.’”  On the spur of the moment, the McKinsey team proposed a workshop: to get tools and drills out, then and there, and find ways to cut the weight. Together the entire team looked at every component—drill a hole here, nip away material there. They lost ounces. “From that experience, we all saw a better way of working. By sharing the common goal, it changed the whole mindset of the team,” Emelie said. “It doesn’t feel like a client relationship, but like a partnership.” “It feels good to work with a partner who has so much trust,” says Hans. “3M has an appreciation of good design—we share that as a starting point. We complement each other skill-wise. They have the deep technical and mechanical expertise while we focus on the design and exterior surfaces. We are on the same software systems, so it’s a seamless integrated workflow. Together we share a wealth of knowledge.” Giving emotional resonance to a functional object Over the years, our designers have drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources including medieval knights, superheroes, ergonomics, and Chinese acupressure. But for many, the helmet model closest to their hearts is the 9000 launched in 1996. It was the first time user research had been incorporated into every step, and it was a major departure in design. The shape of the helmet morphed from a square mailbox into a mask that felt more like a natural extension of the wearer’s face. “The design team had a lot of discussions with the welders about the emotional aspects or character we wanted to express,” explains Hans. “It had to be very professional, powerful. Welders are very proud of their work–just think of the image of Rosie the Riveter, who was a welder. This was the heritage of the profession. If it were in a movie, the helmet would have to be fit for a hero knight on a black dragon.” Designers introduced a ridge down the middle of the helmet face to suggest the look of armor and expressed trust through open forehead lines and other facial nuances. The ‘line of sight’ is angled downward, focused on the hands—the work. This model also incorporated the ability to exhale through side vents. “At the time, they were actually put on mannequins in the windows of one of Stockholm’s finest department stores as a fashion item because they looked so cool,” recalls Emelie. “They went from being a very functional object to having an emotional element.” The helmet would be cited as an example of ‘futuristic’ design for the next ten years. After it was launched in 1996, the strikingly futuristic 3M Speedglas 9000 helmet was displayed on mannequins in the department store Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm. Breathing easier Three years later, the team introduced the Speedglas Adflo, an air-purifying respirator that circulated air to reduce heat and improve breathability. It was a fan attachment that fit snugly down the welder’s body, fastened with a belt at the waist. This tight profile reduced the risk of the welder getting snagged on the equipment. “It was a revolutionary change,” said Oskar. “All of the other fans on the market had a round filter attached to the back which looked like a mushroom. By 2014, we went to a trade show, and every fan on market had this tight, streamlined look—our design had moved the market.” Last year, 3M launched the G5-02 for highly precise TIG welding. The helmet holds the world’s first curved glass shield, a design that follows the shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This year, it won the Red Dot award with a Best of the Best distinction. Looking ahead, Oskar predicts: “The helmets will become almost like a second skin, with softer, high-tech materials rather than hard plastic which is bulky, uncomfortable, noisy. Shields are already connected to blue tooth so you can maneuver equipment with a phone; there will be developments with cameras and video, and radar may be used for detecting the target, rather than light.” The evening news While the awards and external praise are gratifying, some of the most satisfying recognition has come from welders themselves. “We have had many, many stories, but there are a couple that are more famous within 3M,” Anders says. “We had a welder here in Sweden who we were visiting at his work site. We had just introduced the respiratory protection together with the helmet. After a moment’s thought, he said that he liked the helmet now because he could actually watch the late news on television. Before he began using the respirator, he was so tired that he would fall asleep before the news had started. That was an indication to us that the product that we had supplied to the market was actually helping to improve our users’ quality of life. It is a huge motivation for all of the people in our company to continue working with this kind of product.” For Oskar, the ultimate recognition came with the futuristic 9100 series. “Some welders tattooed themselves with images of that shield,” says Oskar. “That says something about our design.” Related Practices Design | Operations | Technology Related Articles How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger How award-winning design is helping older adults live safely and with dignity at home", "summary": "For 40 years, a collaboration between 3M and Speedglas has revolutionized welding helmet design, enhancing safety and comfort through innovations like automatic darkening glass and improved ergonomics.

With partnership from Spirit AeroSystems and McKinsey, they reached unprecedented new production heights.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/how-we-help-clients/a-manufacturing-moonshot", "image_url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/operations/how%20we%20help%20clients/a%20manufacturing%20moonshot/vyaire_thumb_workers_591168885_1536x1536.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&car=16:9&cpy=Center", "date": "2022-04-06T12:00:00Z", "article_text": "How a manufacturing moonshot was made In March 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, the New York Times ran a story under the headline: “There aren’t enough ventilators to cope with the coronavirus.” It explained that the number of ventilators in the world at the time could not meet the rising demand of patients seriously afflicted with the disease. There appeared to be no solution. The complexity of the devices, whose supply chains comprise hundreds of specialized manufacturers scattered across the globe, made production surges seemingly impossible. “Italy wanted to order 4,000,” a European manufacturer told the paper, “but there’s not a chance.” Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, an effort was underway that would unite a group of optimists and problem solvers from Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, McKinsey, and an array of Vyaire’s suppliers. Together, they embarked on an ambitious quest to dramatically increase ventilator production, thereby giving medical professionals a chance to better care for critically ill patients. Before it was all said and done, the venture would put thousands of furloughed people back to work, stand up a new ventilator-manufacturing facility, and bolster links in far-flung supply chains on the way to hitting a production rate that would deliver nearly a years’ worth of ventilators every three days . “At Vyaire, we take pride in accepting and facing challenges that others might shy away from,” says Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal. “In this case, we achieved something others might not dare to imagine.” Beyond business as usual The history of mechanical ventilation goes back hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until the polio epidemics of the early 20th century that the devices were widely used. Among the most well-known was the Drinker respirator, or “iron lung,” which looked like a mini submarine and was powered by vacuum-cleaner motors. They’ve come a long way since then. Today, these devices are the size of a large briefcase and utilize multiple circuit boards, complex software, and hundreds of components to control things like air pressure, flow rate, oxygen level, humidity, and temperature. Their engineering has more in common with aerospace systems than with household appliances. Ventilators are much scarcer than either of those things, however, and the outbreak of COVID-19 introduced a vast and widening gulf between supply and demand. In April of 2020, for instance, a McKinsey team looking at global medical supplies estimated that there were about 23 ventilators per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the most plentiful supply. “In Africa,” says Miyu Toyoshima Galliart, a McKinsey associate partner, “the region with the lowest supply according to the analysis, the estimate was fewer than one [ventilator] per 100,000 people.” Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth “To call this extraordinary-demand scenario ‘unprecedented’ would be a gross understatement,” says McKinsey partner Ron Ritter, who helped lead the effort. “Nothing about ventilators—their supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, service, or support—was ever designed for anything like what happened with COVID-19.” Typical ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day. Vyaire’s production team suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Of course, Vyaire’s operations were built for typical demand—not the increased needs of a pandemic. Its usual ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day, which is a lot considering the complexity, quality-control requirements, and capital-asset value. (By comparison, the highest-demand commercial aircraft in modern history never once exceeded a production rate of 60 per month. While different in many ways, both are highly engineered capital assets.) In April of 2020, Vyaire’s main ventilator product line suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Making that number would require a ramp in production toward 700 units a day in a matter of weeks. “Our executive team heard the concern in the voices of colleagues in the field, who were speaking with clinicians and providers across the world,” says Tammy Noll, senior vice president and general manager of Vyaire’s ventilation franchise. “We knew immediately no amount of business-as-usual was going to work.” So, the company got to work on business-as- unusual . The first step was to maximize output at Vyaire’s Palm Springs, California plant. Joined by industrial engineers from a major auto manufacturer in North America, Vyaire and McKinsey teams worked to revalidate basic manufacturing numbers, dial-in labor, and machinery capacity. Stopwatches and toolboxes in hand, these experts did everything they could—timed process cycles, analyzed bottlenecks, reviewed floor layouts, tweaked machines, and more—to get the most out of the capacity they had at hand. “We started with a spreadsheet,” says Bhavuk Tandon, a McKinsey associate and member of the team walking the factory floor, “and we were conducting time studies on the floor, going through every cell, understanding all the lines and how they worked. We needed that information to help us understand what we had to do to build a facility that [would] give 30 times and more—fast.” Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations. The practice, Ron says, can be an effective first step during critical shortages. “Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations,” he explains. “Finding it normally produces a 20 to 30 percent boost in output right away.” Once the analysis was complete, Vyaire added shifts to the reoptimized line. The moves helped increase production by about threefold. It was a huge leap by industry standards, but well short of what it would take to begin meeting demand. To get there, the company would need to make an even bigger move—to the American heartland. An interview with Vyaire Medical CEO Gaurav Agarwal A new workforce, a new building With its Palm Springs plant running as hard as it could—yet still falling behind demand—Vyaire leaders began working hard to find more workers. “This was about finding an entire second workforce,” says David Marchand, now a McKinsey alum, who helped lead the project. “In a single product line, we needed an estimated 800 people: front-line operators, supervisors, process engineers, maintenance techs, security guards, department leads, site executives, warehouse staff, shipping departments, buyers—and they needed to know how to perform extremely well together, right away.” When needed immediately, a workforce like that can’t be hired incrementally. The only way to acquire one was to locate an intact team—which came from Spirit AeroSystems. The aerospace and medical-device industries may seem like strange bedfellows, but Spirit was the right partner for several reasons. Operationally, their people know industrialization, have high production standards, and operate complex supply chains. And in this case, given COVID-19’s impact on air travel, the company had people who were furloughed and more than ready to get back to work. We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world. This was clearly an international-security-level situation. But beyond that, it was Spirit’s culture that made them the perfect fit. According to Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile, “Spirit cultivates a ‘can be done,’ mission-oriented culture that has been built on accepting challenges.” This challenge tapped the company’s core values of transparency, collaboration, and inspiration, and it inspired the combined workforce of over 1000 employees. “We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world,” says Tom. “This was clearly an international-security-level situation.” To get the most out of this workforce, Vyaire looked beyond California in search of more production capacity. They found it 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, where Vyaire decided to open an additional ventilator plant. That may be easy to imagine, but it was hard to execute. Beyond a suitable 55,000 square-foot building, it took machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, quality control, assembly, testing facilities, and much more. Capacities for each manufacturing-process step had to be calculated. Several miles of copper, medical-grade oxygen gas-flow lines, electrical drops, and industrial-grade air compressors had to be installed. Data connectivity to handle huge test-protocol transactions with cloud-based legacy software needed to be set. Workstations, production tooling, and a range of fixtures had to be built or sourced and calibrated. Even basics like car parking for 200-person shifts, break rooms, badging, security, and fire-control had to be installed. Most critically, Vyaire and Spirit had to design and build workforce COVID-19 safety, including social-distancing fixtures, temperature screening, reporting, and testing protocols. “We were hyper focused on providing a safe environment for every single person who was about to work in that building,” says Noll. “We also knew the risk of outbreak in this facility carried added weight. Not only were we concerned about their health and that of their families, but we were also cognizant that the consequences of illness there would be felt by patients in need of these devices across the globe.” Vyaire and Spirit were now ready to chase a benchmark that, months prior, would’ve only existed in a company’s wildest dreams. All they needed now were enough parts to make it a reality. Supply-chain reaction Supply-chain operations make and deliver tangible aspects of our lives and create the fundamental material pathways in a functioning society. Unappreciated in normal times, they rush to the forefront in times of crisis, such as the great wars and most recently, COVID-19. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. During COVID-19, these suppliers were just as pressed as Vyaire. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. Much of their supply-chain expense sits among fasteners, precision-machined valves, resin-molded components, electronic circuits, batteries, and more. During COVID-19, the plants that manufacture these components were just as pressed as Vyaire. Versions of the same efficiency processes happening in Palm Springs and Wichita unfolded in hundreds of operations across the ventilator supply chain. The effectiveness of these moves was critical to boosting output, but they were harder for Vyaire to control. The suppliers medical-device manufacturers use were scattered globally. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they were often hit by competing demands. For example, an electronics manufacturer that makes medical-device circuit boards could see a wave of demand for virtual-work devices. Suppliers did their best to respond. Many found ways to ramp-up quickly and help get Vyaire and Spirit what they needed. Others lost adjacent demand and had capacity to spare. But in some cases, suppliers lost capacity or had exceedingly long lead times. The most critical of these situations—the ones whose projected output would limit the team’s target rate—were placed on a “red list.” Early on, the red list was long. “It was apparent that dozens of material sources might hold us back,” says Jenna Stauffer, a McKinsey engagement manager who worked on supply chains in the effort. Clearing the red list would require advanced intervention. A group comprising Vyaire’s most experienced buyers and manufacturing experts worked directly with suppliers to get specific information on process flows, bottleneck constraints, shipping delays, and the company’s own component constraints. In most cases, these interventions worked. But in extreme cases, teams cleared to travel during COVID-19 lockdown conditions worked directly with vendors on site. In one example, a European producer of pressure transducers emerged as a key constraint. Teams traveled to the plant, mapped the entire process flow, and installed IoT sensors on a key rate-determining step in a single day. The work provided live, digital tracking of actual production against the max potential rate, and it helped the site raise its output within 48 hours. The red list work was among the most relentless of the entire effort. It went on around the clock daily, as time zones rolled through the global night, demanding nonstop problem solving for months. The impossible made possible—by people If machines and technology were this effort’s arms and legs, people—many of whom have never met in person to this day—were its head and heart. They were united through a relentless drive to help, a product of the cultures at both Vyaire and Spirit, and they had the skills necessary to do so. “Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring,” says Catherine-Sophie Haigh, a McKinsey operations specialist who worked on the project. “Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity, and they trusted the teammate by their side—in many cases by their ‘virtual’ side.” Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring. Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity. This was especially evident around one of the initiative’s most critical moments. When it became clear that the Palm Springs plant would never have the capacity to hit rising target rates, and splitting focus between it and the Wichita plant was sapping energy, leaders decided to execute what became known as “lift and shift” to consolidate the entire operation under a single roof. This meant shutting down the key ventilator production lines in the California plant over a weekend, crating all production equipment, and moving it as quickly and safely as possible to Kansas. Given the stakes, the risk of losing equipment in transit, having it not restart, or suffering irreparable damage was frightening. “I’d done something like this on a smaller scale before,” says McKinsey partner Jonathan Tilley, who helped lead the effort. “It’s not plug and play. I was nervous, and we all knew what a loss in output meant for people who needed ventilators.” During removal, teams would video-record and catalogue every screw, bolt, and connector to help the receiving teams put it all back together. The transit process was scrutinized for weather conditions and other variables. The team even consulted a satellite manufacturer to learn about preventing vibration damage en route to the new facility. “This entire move was conceived, decided, and completed in less than ten days,” Jonathan adds. “By working together, we all pulled it off.” The “lift and shift” success turned out to be one proof point in a massive success story. As the project progressed into the fall of 2020, Vyaire’s global delivery of ventilators crossed 35,000, with peak rates of more than 600 per day sustained on one product line, with more than 1,000 across all. “I still remember when the call came across to join this effort,” says McKinsey senior expert and associate partner Phil Duncan, who helped lead the work. “It was one of those moments in your career when you know you’ve just got to do it. It was a little nerve-wracking at points. It was emotional and meaningful. We all have a ton of pride in this because we did the work together.” Ten lessons on supply-chain readiness. By Ron Ritter Vyaire and Spirit got so much right in this unprecedented effort. Here’s what we learned from them. There is tremendous gain in getting this ever more right, as Vyaire and Spirit have shown us. Routine cost and delivery performance can improve through everyday enhancements across the organization. Stronger, more confident, and better-prepared organizational talent will build lasting culture around a sense of purpose. More rigorous design standards and better supplier networks are better able to respond with resiliency, and the brand will be stronger and more credible in projecting to the market. In normal days, operations will deliver better, faster, cheaper, safer. In a crisis, it may make all the difference in a decisive response. At peak, Vyaire was producing more ventilators in three days than their entire 2019 output. Over 19,000 units were built in the Kansas factory in just over 12 weeks by Spirit’s workforce. Similar feats were accomplished at other plants around the world, including among thousands of component suppliers. “We all worked together to create a state-of-the-art ventilator-production operation, supply chain, logistics, and workforce in less than six weeks that sent critical devices to patients in need around the world,” says Spirit’s CEO Tom Gentile. “I could not be prouder of what we all have done.” Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal agrees. “Yes, it was bold, and daunting at times, but there was never a chance we weren’t going to stand up to this moment,” he says. “Patients and customers were counting on us and our collective teams to meet the challenge.” This particular moment may have passed, and critical-care ventilator demand has since eased, but according to McKinsey’s Ron Ritter, the campaign nevertheless stands as an epic industrial success: “It also says a lot about what organizations can do when they have the courage to face what feels like an impossible objective, and inspire their people to do the same.” Related Practice To learn more about how McKinsey helps organizations improve manufacturing, please visit our Operations website , where you can also gain insight into CEO leadership of operations, supply-chain resilience , and much more.", "summary": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, and McKinsey collaborated to rapidly increase ventilator production, transforming supply chains and establishing a new manufacturing facility.

That was when Wayne Brown, the operations manager at the Vistra-owned Martin Lake Power Plant, built and deployed a heat rate optimizer (HRO). About Vistra and its emissions-reduction goals Vistra Corp. is the largest competitive power producer in the United States and operates power plants in 12 states with a capacity of more than 39,000 megawatts of electricity—enough to power nearly 20 million homes. Vistra has committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent by 2030 (against a 2010 baseline) and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve its goals, the business is increasing efficiency in all its power plants and transforming its generation fleet by retiring coal plants and investing in solar- and battery-energy storage, which includes the world’s largest grid-scale battery energy-storage facility. Vistra’s to path to net zero will also require it to grow its zero-carbon portfolio to more than 7000 megawatts by 2026. The “heat rate” is a measure of the thermal efficiency of the plant—the amount of fuel required for each unit of electricity produced. To reach the optimal heat rate, plant operators continuously monitor and tune hundreds of variables, or “set points” on things like steam temperatures, pressures, oxygen levels, and fan speeds. It’s a lot for any operator to get right 100 percent of the time—so Vistra thought AI could help. Partnering for innovation With this goal in mind, Wayne and his group worked together with a McKinsey team that included data scientists and machine learning engineers from QuantumBlack AI by McKinsey , to build a multilayered neural-network model—essentially an algorithm powered by AI that learns about the effects of complex nonlinear relationships. This model went through two years’ worth of data at the plant and learned which combination of external factors—such as temperature and humidity—and internal decisions, like set points that operators control, would optimize the algorithm and attain the best heat-rate efficiency at any point in time. Vistra team members provided continuous guidance about the intricacies of how the plant worked, and identified critical data sources from sensors, which helped McKinsey engineers refine the model, adding and removing variables to see how those changes affected the heat rate. Through this training process, and by introducing better data, the models “learned” to make ever more accurate predictions. When the models were accurate to 99 percent or higher and run through a rigorous set of real-world tests, a McKinsey team of machine learning engineers converted them into an AI-powered engine. This generated recommendations every 30 minutes for operators to improve the plant’s heat-rate efficiency. At a meeting with all of Vistra’s leaders to review the HRO, Lloyd Hughes, a seasoned operations manager at the company’s Odessa plant, said, “There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon.” There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon. With this kind of power at their fingertips, Wayne and his team could make better, more informed decisions. Acting on the HRO recommendations helped Martin Lake run more than two percent more efficiently after just three months in operation, resulting in $4.5 million per year in savings and 340,000 tons of carbon abated. This carbon reduction was the equivalent of taking 66,000 cars off the road. 1 Calculations based on “ Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References “, United States Environmental Protection Agency If that doesn’t sound like a lot, consider this: companies that build gas-fueled power plants invest millions of dollars in research and development over four to five years to achieve a one-percent improvement in power-generation efficiency. Vistra hit that improvement level in only one-twentieth the amount of time using the data and equipment it already had. 2 Calculations based on source material from “A Brief History of GE Gas Turbines”, Power , July 8, 2019, and Frequently asked questions, US Energy Information Administration, last reviewed September 20, 2021 Creating value beyond the hype Vistra has since rolled the HRO out to another 67 power-generation units across 26 plants, for an average one-percent improvement in efficiency, and more than $23 million in savings. Along with the other AI initiatives, these efforts have helped Vistra abate about 1.6 million tons of carbon per year, which is ten percent of its remaining 2030 carbon-reduction commitment. That’s equivalent to offsetting about 50 percent of what a 500-megawatt coal plant emits. What happened at Martin Lake has happened at dozens of Vistra’s other power plants, with more than 400 AI models (and counting) deployed across the company’s fleet to help operators make even better decisions. It also reflects a core trait of Vistra’s AI transformation, which is that it isn’t a story of one massive hit, but rather the story of dozens of meaningful improvements snowballing to deliver significant value in terms of accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth. It’s also the story of how an organization architected an approach to rapidly scale every successful AI solution across the entire business. And it’s a story of how a continuous improvement culture, combined with a powerful AI modeling capability, helped leaders and plant operators do their jobs better than ever before. With more than $60 million captured in about one year of work and another $40 million in progress, Vistra is well on its way to delivering against a roadmap of $250-$300 million in identified EBITDA and more than two million tons of carbon abatement per year. The AI-driven advances at Vistra have heralded a generational shift in the power sector in terms of improvements in efficiency, reliability, safety, and sustainability.\nIf the one-percent improvement in efficiency the HRO delivered across the fleet was carried across all coal- and gas-fired plants in the US electric-power generation industry, 15 million tons of carbon would be abated annually—the equivalent of decommissioning more than two large coal plants or planting about 37 million trees. 3 The tree equivalency is based on calculations derived from the “The global tree restoration potential” study, published in the journal Science, July 5, 2019. That means less fuel needed to deliver power to the hospitals, schools, and businesses that rely on it. AI has the potential to bring similar levels of improvement to renewables as well, making them a more cost-effective and attractive energy option. Turning points on the AI journey Healthy skepticism and a culture of favoring action over words at Vistra meant that the biggest hurdle in the AI journey wasn’t the technology: it was the people. Vistra leadership and operations managers needed to know what AI could do and be convinced it could really work. It was this ingrained culture of continuous improvement—alongside a highly competitive market and a commitment to sustainability—that convinced Vistra’s leadership they needed to give AI a chance. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Seeing real possibilities The first question was a relatively simple one: “How can AI help improve the way Vistra generates power?” Answers to that question bubbled over when 50 of Vistra’s top leaders came to a McKinsey-hosted workshop. In multiple sessions, experts explained how AI worked, walked through detailed case studies showing how other companies used analytics and AI to generate value and gave live demonstrations of technologies, including digitized workflows and machine learning. Leaders in analytics from various sectors—including Amazon, Falkonry, Element Analytics, and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, as well as G2VP from the venture-capital world—provided insights and examples of how AI works. “I saw an example of how a metallurgical plant was using AI to help its operators optimize set points and it clicked for me,” remembers Patrick “Cade” Hay, the plant manager for Vistra’s Lamar power plant. “I saw how I could translate that into helping me run my own plants more efficiently. This was my lightbulb moment.” Company leaders and plant managers poured over process flow sheets and engineering diagrams to determine pain points as well as opportunities. This exercise allowed them to focus first on finding where the value was, then secondly on what technologies were needed to deliver it. Many of the operations opportunities were around yield and energy optimization and predictive maintenance, which according to our research, were the top AI use cases for manufacturing industries . By the end of the session, Vistra had developed a strategy to develop a series of AI solutions that could capture $250-$300 million in potential EBITDA while helping the company achieve its 2030 emissions-reductions goals. Codeveloping the AI While the analysis looked promising, proving it in the field was what mattered. “If our plant managers aren’t bought in, then things don’t happen,” explained Barry Boswell, Vistra’s executive vice president of power-generation operations. “So, we said, ‘Let’s pick a leader who is knowledgeable and skeptical, because if we can win them over, we can get everyone.’” They picked Cade. Not only did he run a top-performing plant in terms of profitability, reliability, and heat rate, he had a reputation for telling it like it is—Barry trusted Cade to tell him whether or not the value potential in AI was real. When he approached Cade about testing out a proof of concept to optimize duct burners, he was intrigued but predictably skeptical. Cade saw the potential in AI but was interested in finding out if it could actually help in the field. Duct burners essentially work like afterburners in jet planes; they provide a surge of energy when needed. Operators use them as supplements to hit energy targets, which are known as their “dispatch point.” The issue is that powering duct burners uses more fuel than regular methods, so it’s more expensive, generates more carbon emissions, and increases the wear and tear on equipment. McKinsey subject matter experts, data scientists, and analytics translators from QuantumBlack worked closely with a team from Vistra comprised of power generation and process experts as well as front-line operators to understand how the plant works, what data was available from the sensors already in place, and what variables could be directed—like the fact that the number of cooling fans running could be controlled, while the ambient temperature couldn’t. Working together Denese Ray, operations shift supervisor for Vistra’s Coleto Creek power plant; Doug Richter, the shift supervisor at the same plant; and Muro Kaku, McKinsey analyst and data scientist, discuss how they worked together. Denese: “Every week, I’d bring in a different supervisor to join us for our check-in calls with McKinsey. In this way, Muro and the McKinsey team saw what we were dealing with. We really needed all our supervisors and their feedback to build the model so we could get the most from it.” Muro: “That really mattered. For example, when we first trialed the HRO at the Coleto Creek plant, the recommendations were frequently rejected by the operators. We didn’t know why. When we spoke with the operators, they told us about specific rejection reasons, such as the tool recommended increasing superheat temperature by 30 degrees in a 15-minute interval to maximize the heat rate, but it takes the plant longer to heat up, so they rejected the recommendation. We then added a constraint to the tool to keep the increase and decrease to five degrees in a 15-minute interval, which operators could achieve.” Doug: “During load changes [increase or decrease in power output], the parameters are changing constantly, so recommendations to increase air flow at that time were counterproductive. We worked with McKinsey to have the recommendations stop for 30 minutes while we were changing load until the plant was stable again.” Denese: “We were all pretty skeptical of the tool at first, but when we got to play with the heat rate optimizer and see how it worked, and how well McKinsey worked with us in the plant, we understood how it could help.” As the teams developed the models, plant operators reviewed recommendations to see what made sense, what other variables needed to be tested, and what kinds of recommendations the operators would find most helpful. By analyzing the effect of various inputs and set points on the plant—such as pressure and humidity, the angle of blades in the gas turbine, usage of inlet cooling technologies, and the age and performance of various components like filters and condensers—and running it through the model, the analysis was clear: overall duct-burner usage could be reduced by approximately 30 percent, which would result in the equivalent of $175,000 of yearly savings on fuel costs and wear and tear on the system, in addition to an abatement of about 4,700 tons of carbon per year. “We worked closely with the team from McKinsey to develop AI models that reflected the realities of how power plants operate,” said Cade, “and then when we saw the recommendations coming out of the AI tool, I saw how much real value there was.” Going for scale and adoption from the beginning Vistra’s leadership realized from the beginning that the only way to achieve their efficiency and carbon-abatement aspirations was to scale every solution. “We manage the Vistra fleet as one. If a plant is doing something that works, we want every plant to do it,” says Barry. “That’s what we’re built to do.” That realization led Vistra to invest in a five-part system to scale and sustain AI solutions. *** AI solution deep dive QuantumBlack’s Ayush Talwar, an expert associate partner, provides more details on the AI model development: What kind of models did you use? We used a range of models to fit the specific needs of the plant and the solution. These ranged from Bayesian regression models to deep-learning models. How did you choose which model to use? We wanted to find the right balance between model performance, meaning its accuracy; explainability, which describes relationships to the operators; the source richness, which refers to the amount of data available; potential actionability, or how many of the most important features in the model people can actually control; and maintainability, which will reduce need for more technical skills to maintain them. How would you compare the models you used to older ones? Our models were more accurate than previous models, and importantly, more actionable. We used a variety of metrics to measure model performance such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Our models typically achieved MAPEs of less than 1.5 percent. How did you build up your models? Each neural network model was made up of several layers with each layer containing batch normalization, dropout, and activation. We created cross validation and out-of-sample testing sets using time-based splits to prevent overfitting models. We added features based primarily on domain expertise. How did you turn models into tools operators could use? We used machine learning models to make accurate predictions of outcomes. We then wrapped meta-heuristic optimization algorithms around those models to generate recommendations that helped operators make decisions about how to run the plant better. The models were then embedded within the existing production workflows and deployed live in the operator room. Vistra’s story is far from finished. As Cade put it, “We’re just looking at the tip of the iceberg.” Vistra’s roadmap for 2022 and 2023 includes bringing AI to its rapidly growing renewables fleet of solar and batteries to optimize yield and reliability, among other initiatives. To help sustain this ambition, Vistra is building up its talent bench. In addition to hiring a small team of data scientists and engineers, Rachit has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas to offer basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in AI and analytics for Vistra employees. Some 70 people have already completed courses, including those reskilling from statistics to machine learning. Vistra has also built relationships with local colleges and universities to develop internship programs and work with students in capstone projects to identify top technical talent. “We can’t sit around and just do what we did yesterday to be ready for tomorrow,” Barry says. “We’ve seen enough to know what’s possible.” The authors would like to thank Wayne Brown, Rachit Gupta, Patrick “Cade” Hay, Lloyd Hughes, Denese Ray, and Doug Richter from Vistra Corp., and Richard Bates, Dan Hurley, Pablo Illuzzi, Nephi Johnson, Muro Kaku, Jay Kim, George Lederman, Abhay Prasanna, Noel Ramirez, and Ayush Talwar from McKinsey.

Three days earlier, Reina, 15 at the time, had acted on suicidal thoughts, and Kana spent nearly every hour since searching for mental health crisis resources for adolescents. Everyone told her the same thing: take her to the ER. Kana, who is now the director of brain health at the McKinsey Health Institute, is also a 25-year veteran in the behavioral health arena and knew the ER wouldn’t help her daughter—but there was no other option. The doctor recommended inpatient care, but no beds were available, so for three and a half days, Reina was confined to a glass-walled room under bright lights and constant surveillance, isolated from everyone except her mom, who slept in the hospital chair next to her as they waited for a bed to open up in the adolescent psych unit. “Sitting in an emergency room for days at a time, not being able to get the help your kid needs is devastating,” Kana says. “I had advocated for evidence-based mental health services throughout my career, yet couldn’t find them for my own child.” A growing behavioral health crisis Kana and Reina’s experience isn’t uncommon. In the United States, crises related to behavioral health, a term that refers to both mental and substance use disorders, have been on the rise for more than two decades—particularly among youth. Between 2009 and 2020, the United States saw a 30 percent increase in the national age-adjusted suicide rate. By winter of 2021 , the weekly rate of ER visits by adolescents who attempted suicide was 39 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the average rate for adolescent girls had increased 50 percent over the previous year. Despite these alarming numbers, community crisis-care resources remain limited. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline center, roughly 39 million Americans aged 12 and older could benefit from having access to a service for vulnerable people dealing with suicide, mental health, or substance use issues. Limited crisis services mean law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and ERs end up responding to most behavioral health crises, regardless of whether the individual is a threat to public safety or in need of emergency care. “What we're doing now is services that are high cost and low efficacy,” says Kana. “It’s the wrong recipe.” Dr. John Palmieri is a senior medical advisor and the acting director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Behavioral Health Crisis Team , which includes the 988 Lifeline. He spent the early part of his clinical career working in emergency psychiatric departments and witnessed firsthand the misdirection of care and resources for those in behavioral health crisis. “You see the downstream effects of where the system fails in so many ways when you’re in those settings day after day,” he says. “How are we looking upstream to prevent these crisis situations from happening in the first place or recurring?” A hotline to help those in need The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, passed in 2020, made “988” the official nationwide three-digit behavioral health crisis number as of July 2022. This meant that, for the first time, those experiencing a behavioral health crisis anywhere in the country would only have to remember three digits to find the appropriate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline first launched in 2005 as a ten-digit number. At the time, Kana was working for the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA, which oversaw the number’s rollout. Over the years, she watched the Lifeline evolve, expanding to include options for Spanish language, veterans’ crises, and disaster distress help lines. “I've been along for the journey of the growth of the Lifeline and saw advocacy from the field trying to advance a three-digit calling number,” she says. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. The new easy-to-remember number, while hugely promising, raises at least one potential challenge. Call volume—rising over the years—has already begun skyrocketing since the new number launched. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. To help localities and stakeholders across the country prepare for this surge, the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), the firm's non-profit-generating entity that focuses on addressing public health challenges, has been involved in a range of nationwide efforts. This includes helping ensure states, contact centers, first responders, and community behavioral health providers know exactly what they need to meet demand—be it new strategies, workforce training, data infrastructure upgrades, or other support. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Defining effective crisis care In December 2020, MHI came together with a group of national behavioral health and crisis-care stakeholders for a series of working sessions organized by Vibrant Emotional Health , the not-for-profit administrator of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; RI International , a global organization focused on the design and delivery of behavioral health crisis services; and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) . The goal was to help prepare for the launch of 988. MHI began by listening to 911 managers, mental health and substance-use treatment providers, contact center operators, and first responders to develop a consensus around the critical dimensions of crisis care. MHI gathered input from participating partners on what critical elements of community-based crisis care were necessary for the delivery of the 988 Lifeline. These conversations helped establish a shared understanding among stakeholders around the priorities of community-based crisis care: ensuring that anyone in crisis has someone to call, someone to help, and a safe place to go, as envisioned in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care . Simple as it sounds, this involves developing a continuum of care that includes the 988 crisis line staffed by local workers who can provide information, deescalate crises, and—when in-person support is needed—connect people with nearby services and relevant resources. Had this kind of response existed in 2019, Kana and her daughter would have had a place to go besides the ER; one that might have provided appropriate care and helped ease already constrained hospital capacity. About the McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating global entity within McKinsey. MHI strives to catalyze actions across continents, sectors, and communities to achieve material improvements in health, adding years to life and life to years. Core to this aspiration is improving brain health. Brain disorders take a significant toll on both life expectancy and quality of life. In particular, the urgent and rising rate of mental health, substance use, and suicidal crises globally calls for a transformation of access to mobile crisis response and community-based crisis services. Through its foundational collaboration-based approach, MHI brings together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health. The result is meaningful impact on initiatives like the rollout of 988 in the United States and similar multistakeholder partnerships on crisis care around the world. Measuring costs and savings involved What would it take to ensure such crises are handled by trained professionals—including clinicians, peers, and other provider types—across a coordinated continuum of care in every community? To help answer this question, MHI began working with RI International in 2021 to build the Crisis Resource Need Calculator , a web-based cost calculator that allows local leaders to see a projection of annual behavioral health crisis care costs by county or state. The calculator enables them to understand the cost of providing for every individual in need of local, in-person crisis care based on SAMHSA’s national guidelines. It also considers how many mobile crisis teams states and counties would need, and what resources that would involve to build out to scale. The Crisis Resource Need Calculator also highlights potential healthcare savings available by making this shift in resources. Overall, the calculator estimates that with fully resourced community-based crisis systems in place, the United States could save a total of $34 billion in annual behavioral health costs otherwise spent on ER visits and inpatient beds. Helping build an action plan In addition to care costs, MHI also attempted to better assess responder readiness for the transition to 988. To do this, from November 2021 to March 2022, MHI partnered with state, federal, and local entities to develop detailed operational assessment playbooks to help key audiences, including states, tribes and territories, crisis contact operators, 911 centers, and behavioral health providers with understanding how they can prepare for the change. “The McKinsey team has been the glue that helped put this all together,” says Brian Hepburn, executive director of NASMHPD, which partnered with SAMHSA to prepare for 988’s 2022 rollout. “The effectiveness of the work is dependent on what happens between meetings, and McKinsey filled those gaps with needed data.” In March 2022, the 988 playbooks were released at a gathering of federal, state, and local stakeholders from across the field. They have since been shared with organizations like the National Council of State Legislators and the National Governors Association to help inform the efforts to scale 988. They’ve also been distributed by partners including the National Emergency Number Association , the National Association for State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors , and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing . Each playbook is geared toward a specific crisis-response group, including 911 professionals, Lifeline network contact centers, mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers, states, territories, and tribes. The playbooks were designed to help state and local leaders understand whether they’re properly staffed, funded, and prepared for 988 response and how to get there. “These playbooks offer stakeholders a self-assessment of their own readiness and links to specific recommendations and tools,” says Brian. Ensuring equitable care One of the ongoing challenges these playbooks attempt to tackle is creating equitable crisis care across communities. Ensuring underserved communities have their unique needs taken into consideration is one of the biggest challenges facing the current system, says Shelby Rowe, director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center . Shelby, a citizen of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma who has personally experienced suicidal episodes, sits on the board of RI International and advocates for marginalized groups and tribal communities to get access to the full spectrum of crisis care.\n“If you’re a 15-year-old black trans girl, your experience asking for help in Brooklyn, New York is going to be very different from your experience asking for help in rural Oklahoma,” she says. Creating a more equitable system requires including diverse voices of those with lived experiences and addressing the underlying challenges and limitations facing specific communities. For example, tribal boundaries don’t always align to state lines, which keeps tribal communities from accessing crisis resource funding; the needs of vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ youth; the lack of access to crisis response in remote rural communities; the struggles people of color face when attempting to find medical or crisis help, and the list goes on. “We have an opportunity and an obligation to build a truly equitable crisis response system,” says Shelby. Creating a sustainable model Today, crisis response and stabilization services are primarily funded by federal, state, and local governments. Many crisis contact centers are transitioning from trained volunteer workforces to paid specialized staff. Yet an equitable, fully resourced continuum requires sustainable funding and commitment to meet diverse needs across communities. To support this, MHI and its collaborators, NASMHPD and SAMHSA, are working on several ongoing efforts. This includes examining healthcare claims to better understand how crisis services are paid for, developing a tool to forecast the number of healthcare workers a state or community needs for crisis care, and developing models and strategies to lessen the burden on the crisis workforce. The idea is that state and local governments, payers, and providers can use these resources to better support the current workforce, focus workforce development efforts, and plan for long-term financial sustainability. “The McKinsey team’s expertise in analytics helped identify some of the root-cause factors driving workforce shortages and what financing models can impact this journey along the crisis treatment system,” says SAMHSA’s John Palmieri. Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives. It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. All of these moving parts come together to steer a broader plan of action for crisis care in the United States. The five-year vision put forth by SAMHSA includes the goal of having 90 percent or more of all 988 calls answered in-state by the end of 2023, up from 71 percent in 2020 , and providing 80 percent or more of individuals in the United States with access to mobile crisis response and local services in the next two to five years. “What’s missing today is widespread, community-based approaches to managing suicidality, mental health crises, and substance use crises both for adults and kids,” says Kana. “Those are the services communities need and getting them actually costs much less and produces better outcomes.” Including for people like Reina. Since the initial frightening 2019 episode, Kana and her daughter had several others before the family found support through a local county-run organization offering in-home counseling and support to kids and families in need. Reina has since become an advocate for crisis support for teenagers and started a not for profit in her community to raise awareness for suicide prevention and youth mental health. “Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives,” says Kana. “It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. It’s going take a lot of cross-sector collaboration to transform our nation’s response to behavioral health crises, and MHI is a committed partner along the way.” Related Articles Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z Addressing employee burnout: Are you solving the right problem?

ECU Worldwide is one of the largest less-than-container-load shippers in the world, with 30 years of experience, servicing close to 2,400 trade routes across 180 countries and 40,000 port pairs across the globe. In December 2019, just before the start of the global pandemic, leadership from ECU Worldwide began working with McKinsey to chart a plan for an ambitious transformation – an 18-month program called “Voyager.” The program would lead ECU Worldwide to a complete organizational overhaul that put in place leadership co-ordination and new technology that offered a better experience for their global workforce and customers. As a result, ECU Worldwide saw sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries and an overall doubling of earnings from 2018 to 2021. And they achieved all of this during a period of unprecedented disruption in their industry. The challenge ECU Worldwide operates a 4,500-person team out of more than 300 offices across the world, including offices in India, the United States, and Europe. These locations have accelerated growth into new markets. But they have also brought new challenges to operational cohesion. Locations were run as independent units rather than as parts of an interconnected global business. Sales teams traditionally focused on order fulfillment and issue resolution, rather than customer pipeline building; and in more mature markets, like Europe and the United States, resource utilization wasn’t optimized. Some locations were operating beyond capacity while others were being underutilized. Founder and chairman Shashi Kiran Shetty knew ECU Worldwide needed a new growth strategy. “We believed the company could do far more in terms of market share,” says Shashi. “We needed a digital strategy that would make us future-ready and help build the company into a global leader in the logistics industry.” The solution As the pandemic began upending the global logistics industry, ECU Worldwide worked with McKinsey to focus their goals into a resilient, long-term growth strategy that built operational cohesion and created digital solutions to give them a competitive advantage. “ECU Worldwide wanted a strategy that would make them future-ready and better integrate their people and operations around the world,” says McKinsey associate partner Chandan Kansal . “We helped them think through what organizational changes and digital solutions could make this happen.” Partner Neelesh Mundra leads McKinsey’s logistics work in India and co-leads our manufacturing and supply-chain work in Asia. “More than 50 colleagues from our offices across the world, and experts from our capabilities like McKinsey Digital , Implementation , and People & Organizational Performance , helped bring the best of our firm to this transformation,” he says. After an intensive diagnostic sprint, McKinsey and ECU Worldwide developed Voyager, a transformation plan that featured four central pillars: improving sales efficiency, transforming operations using analytics, optimizing the customer journey, and creating a future-ready organization. How it was done McKinsey helped the company identify more than 15 geographies across three major markets – Europe, Asia, and North America – that comprised the majority of ECU Worldwide’s overall business. The company looked closely at how sales teams in these regions worked with their customers, defined growth milestones, and conducted customer analyses to pinpoint specific country challenges and potential. ECU Worldwide then began working to strengthen connectivity among their sales teams. McKinsey helped build a coordination center that tracks KPIs, shipment movements, and sales and pricing across geographies. Decisions in different parts of the world could now be made and communicated across the organization in real-time, rather than taking several days or weeks to coordinate as they traditionally had. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth After the first 18 months, the growth strategy had been systematically put in place. It featured two major components. Technology transformation How tech enablement sets ECU Worldwide apart A big enabler of ECU Worldwide’s transformation was creating and streamlining centralized technologies that helped track what was happening across priority markets. Prior to this streamlining, data was often reported in different formats across different offices and might take several months to aggregate and review. The company worked with McKinsey to build automated management dashboards that gathered data from each market into a centralized center. A newly revamped customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360 , used data science to create a customer-centric experience. By onboarding new products and vendors onto the platform, ECU360 created a digital ecosystem spanning users across more than 80 countries, the largest of its kind. A complete organizational redesign ECU Worldwide’s focus then shifted to performance management, which the company led out of a new dedicated transformation office. “The important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization and institutionalization of best practices,” says Sanchita Mohanty, vice president of transformation for ECU Worldwide. “We had a detailed talent-value assessment identifying the key recruits we wanted for the organization to achieve the aspiration that we had set for ourselves.” The very important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization. The automated dashboards gave ECU Worldwide a framework for company-wide performance reviews. The company could now institute KPIs that were common across geographies and tied to the organization’s overall goals. With everyone looking at the same data, workers could see how they were a part of one global organization, working toward common objectives, rather than operating in silos. This impact was then sustained through a newly set up Data Science and Analytics Centre of Excellence. The impact The technology transformation created efficiencies across various areas of the business, improving ECU Worldwide’s resilience along with their visibility and control over cargo movements in the supply chain. The customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360, brought more customer insights to ECU Worldwide, resulting in a 25 percent increase in adoption and 90 percent customer retention rate. A new sales app helped increase productivity for the client workforce with more than 60 percent of bookings now done on ECU360. A yield management tool tracked value leakages and demand spikes, enabling teams to revamp sales strategies. And a redesigned sales accelerator app helped increase productivity by 150 percent. Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership. They implemented the rigor needed to move the organization in the way it needed to move. “This transformation program, Voyager, institutionalized a new way of working within the organization,” says Adarsh Hegde, joint managing director for ECU Worldwide. “Today if you talk to anybody in our offices in China, Germany, or India, you will find the same language being spoken by them.” While forwarders globally saw earnings growth during the pandemic due to demand bottlenecks, ECU Worldwide’s sales program was distinct in that it focused on volume growth specifically, which had been stagnant for several years. By focusing on key markets, ECU Worldwide’s transformation covered 80 percent of overall sales, resulting in sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries as well as sales growth from newly integrated less-than-container-load and trucking services in the past two years. Operations processing time was also reduced by 30 percent thanks to a model office playbook developed and deployed across more than ten countries to streamline operations and set up an ECU Worldwide way of working. Getting this strategy right has enabled the company to start exploring its next bold moves in air freight and cross-border ecommerce. “Bringing focus and drive was a common goal we all aspired for. We’d grown through many acquisitions and needed a common ECU way of doing business,” says Tim Tudor, CEO of ECU Worldwide. “Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership.

In fact, given Scope 3 emissions in their supply chains, manufacturing, transport, and construction are the most emission-heavy sectors in the world. Danfoss is one organization working to change that. One of the largest producers of component parts for heating and cooling, drives, and power solutions, the Nordic company’s net-zero transformation is helping manufacturers around the world green their supply chains. Would you like to learn more about our Sustainability Practice ? The opportunity With more than 42,000 employees across the world, Danfoss produces thousands of components each year. Used across manufacturing industries, these components find their way into countless technologies essential to keeping everyday life moving for people the world over. The company, says CEO Kim Fausing, has an opportunity to make a powerful environmental impact. “We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification,” says Kim. “We want to be the best-in-class preferred partner for customers looking to decarbonize and are taking our own medicine—continuously making the way we run our business more energy efficient.” We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification. Kim and Jürgen Fischer, president of Danfoss Climate Solutions began having high-level discussions with McKinsey in the summer of 2021 about how best to engage customers -- makers of equipment across these emission-heavy sectors who use Danfoss’s component parts – to become their preferred partner in decarbonization. The question at the center of those conversations: What should Danfoss’s decarbonization target be and how could the company make a realistic plan to meet it? Setting a course for net zero Danfoss’s Climate Solutions business is responsible for producing heating and cooling machinery components. Teaming up with McKinsey sustainability experts, Danfoss looked for ways to decarbonize various aspects of it. They learned that while the highest carbon emissions come from the use of products across their entire lifecycle, the second largest source of emissions lies in the materials and construction processes. Product redesign and an alternative supply chain offered two possible ways forward. “Material decarbonization is the next frontier for advanced industries,” says McKinsey partner Jacob Staun. “We helped Danfoss map out the complexity of their supply chains to identify sources of emission and design solutions with a positive impact on cost and carbon.” Innovating with technology To facilitate and accelerate the process, Danfoss, with the help of McKinsey, developed a digital platform that assesses carbon emissions along the entire supply chain of each product. This tool, called Zero Carbon Product, from McKinsey’s Catalyst Zero solution, mapped the company’s bill of materials for each product against a library of around 600 decarbonization levers spanning 100 material categories. The result was a cost-optimized decarbonization roadmap showing, for example, alternative suppliers for certain materials like iron, steel, and aluminum, that could help Danfoss create low-carbon versions of existing products still at low cost. Partnering for success The next step in the process was to test the roadmap’s likelihood of success. Pilot journeys were created for five products from Danfoss’s Climate Solutions portfolio. An assessment of these initial five products found that for a minimal increase in costs, emissions from materials purchased to make each product could be reduced by as much as 95 percent. Here was a clear path to eliminating most emissions at low cost. The program pinpointed exactly where reductions could be made and how – an assessment that took hours rather than days with traditional methods – thereby creating an opportunity to scale the solution across Danfoss’s large product line. At the same time, McKinsey conducted customer interviews to better understand the price elasticity of low-carbon products. This would help Danfoss determine which suppliers to team up with to pilot some of these new sustainable product line solutions. Building capabilities The next question was one of scale. Danfoss’s entire portfolio comprises hundreds of product lines, each with anywhere from tens to hundreds of product variances. While Danfoss has around 5,000 suppliers, McKinsey’s analysis found that around half of total embodied emissions came from just 50 of those suppliers. This created a shortlist to focus on to have the greatest impact. Danfoss worked with McKinsey to build new capabilities, including embedding carbon assessments into product engineering and retraining employees to add decarbonization to their procurement strategy. “Building lower carbon products requires an entirely new way of working, one that requires new skill sets and embedding carbon reduction into every business process including procurement, product design, and go-to-market,” says McKinsey associate partner Jessica Fan. Decarbonizing at scale This has helped Danfoss achieve the goal of assessing its entire Climate Solutions product portfolio by the end of 2022 to create a clear product engineering roadmap moving forward. And it’s become part of a broader set of Science Based Targets : by 2030, Danfoss aims to reduce all direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy by 46.2 percent; reduce emissions across the value chain by 15 percent; and become carbon neutral across its operations. By the end of 2021 into early 2022, training personnel at Danfoss in how to move this decarbonization process forward became a priority. McKinsey deployed a train-the-trainer model, arming around 20 key Danfoss employees with the skills and tools needed to train employees across the organization to carry out this decarbonization mission. Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance. This train-the-trainer process involved identifying key people, making sure they were included in the initial five pilots, then conducting trainings and workshops so they could own the rollout of this new tool. The next step involved taking a closer look at the overall product launch strategy. While the company started with the Climate Solutions segment of its business, the goal is to complete this same process across its other two business units: Power Solutions, which makes up half of the overall business and Power Electronics and Drives, which accounts for another 30 percent. Danfoss is currently working with McKinsey in the proof-of-concept stage for its Power Electronics and Drives business as part of a two-and-a-half-year plan to roll out low carbon products across the entirety of the business. “Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance,” says Kim. “Danfoss is fully committed to both having a positive climate impact and also helping our customers become more climate-friendly through their use of our products and solutions.” Related Articles Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation An AI power play: Fueling the next wave of innovation in the energy sector How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "Danfoss, a global components manufacturer, is on a mission to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.

But there is opportunity here. Building new workforce capabilities can accelerate inclusive growth for national economies, increase socio-economic mobility among workers, and help organizations improve their financial and operational performance. Investing in upskilling and reskilling workers is urgent, yet the playbook for doing so is outdated and won’t meet the multiplying need. McKinsey’s recent reskilling capability-building work with a regional government department in Australia shows what’s possible—and what scale could look like. A global skills crisis A McKinsey Global Institute survey found that 87 percent of companies worldwide reported experiencing skill gaps now or are expecting to within the next five years, impacting productivity and competitiveness at corporate and national levels. Our analysis shows that Japan will need a 2.5 fold increase in productivity growth over the next decade to maintain its recent GDP-growth rate. And the Tech Council of Australia forecasts that its nation will fall 200,000 tech workers short of its 1.2 million target by 2030, with only 7 percent of the non-tech workforce having a strong skills match with tech occupations. Nearly all respondents to the McKinsey Global Institute survey identified closing skill gaps as a main concern, yet only one-third of respondents say their organizations are prepared to address potential role disruptions. Only 28 percent say their organizations make effective decisions on how to close skill gaps. Upskilling and reskilling today’s workforce—in non-degree, skill-building programs—is critical to attracting and retaining talent while driving market competitiveness. “Hiring alone will not meet future workforce demands,” says Rod Farmer, a McKinsey associate partner in Sydney and leader of customer experience and design work in Asia-Pacific for McKinsey Digital. “We’re rapidly moving from a job-based to a skills-based economy requiring more nimble, tech-savvy, and multi-disciplinary teams. We’re seeing significant skills gaps emerging across all sectors of the Australian labor market and broadly across Asia.” One organization that understands this is Australia’s Department of Regional New South Wales (DRNSW), a government department supporting regional communities through agriculture, local infrastructure projects, soil conservation, environmental stewardship, economic development, and more. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated DRNSW’s need for a future-ready workforce. With most employees based in remote areas, many observed an increased need for digital skills but had not received the necessary technological training prior to the pandemic. Increased reliance on digital and data skills became both a strain on the agency’s productivity and accelerated digital inclusivity challenges. Identifying needs, seeing new potential At the onset of the pandemic, DRNSW took stock of its employees’ digital capabilities. The department uncovered a range of digital literacy challenges, ranging from frontline workers relying on friends and colleagues for help with basic digital tasks, such as emails and timesheets, to more complex tasks involving spreadsheets, where increased skills mastery was now essential. We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting. “We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting,” says Donna Mcleod, acting chief people officer of DRNSW. “It was a shock. We had to figure out how to make a fundamental, baseline shift.” DRNSW had tried traditional learning approaches in the past, which fell short of shifting needs and operating models. It needed to move beyond employees learning on their own, separately from their work, which often leads to surface knowledge acquisition only. “We saw there was a major need here—an opportunity for innovation and new capability building models within DRNSW where we could support the people of New South Wales, while also tackling a larger national skills-gap challenge,” says Rod. Over the next 12 months, DRNSW and McKinsey built an enterprise Digital Skills Program, creating an entirely different reskilling engine at the heart of DRNSW. Reinventing skill building McKinsey and DRNSW began their journey by reframing the challenge. DRNSW took an applied skills development approach, focusing on the jobs-to-be-done. This shift meant an increased focus on employee-backed, context-dependent, and on-the-job skills development—solving real day-to-day people development and productivity needs. Core to the DRNSW approach was contextualized learning: the notion that skill development does not happen in a classroom but while employees are on the job, with direct apprenticeship where they are able to immediately operationalize it. Human-centered design resulted in a program informed by a deep study of the individual’s and organization’s needs and pain points, brought to life through ethnographic research across regional and rural New South Wales, addressed in small peer-based groups with individual coaching, and supported by short feedback cycles. “One of the universal pain points we observed was that it’s very difficult for people to make time for upskilling and reskilling beyond their day-to-day responsibilities,” says Donna. “It was important for us to develop a program that placed skill building at the core of their workday, supported by peers and mentors.” The new DRNSW Skills Program helps to identify the specific skills, competencies and proficiency levels required at an organizational level within DRNSW roles. The program then helps assess employee skills, develop tailored programs to close the gaps, and support individuals in their role through direct peer-led coaching. Furthermore, the program scales from shorter upskilling modules to larger reskilling programs to support lateral internal hiring. “We now measure skills readiness in months, not years,” says Rod, who led the DRNSW’s skills transformation. “This isn’t a yearly one-and-done type of problem. Organizations need to institute continuous reskilling and upskilling if they are to maintain future-ready workforces.” To achieve this skills transformation, McKinsey and DRNSW worked with Mentem by UNSW. A new, independent business launched and backed by the University of New South Wales, Mentem helps corporate businesses upskill and reskill their employees at scale through tailored on-the-job training. This collaboration also provided employees the potential to receive micro-credentialling through time spent learning on the job—enabling access to credentialled learning at a global top 50 higher-education institution. Building Mentem by UNSW, a reskilling business UNSW—like many top universities—recognized the opportunity to further extend its post-graduate services beyond its more traditional offerings. Importantly, it also recognized that this challenge required the university to develop new operating and service models that leveraged its unique assets and heritage in adult learning, whilst accelerating product innovation and industry collaboration. To help realise its ambitions, UNSW partnered with Leap by McKinsey (McKinsey’s venture building capability) who helped design, build and launch the new venture at pace. “We’d never have been able to independently build a blueprint for a business this fast—we did it in 12 weeks, which is unheard of at a university for something of this magnitude,” says Arvind. “Mentem exists to provide new educational models for employer and workforce needs in Australia and globally,” says Arvind Sampath, founding chief executive officer of Mentem. “Working with DRNSW was an exciting opportunity to leverage our knowledge and revitalize a government agency we all rely on.” Another core element of the DRNSW Digital Skills Program is the ‘skills hub,’ critical for engaging the broader DRNSW organization and ensuring sustained impact as the program scaled. This new operational unit consists of a DRNSW squad with capability building specialists, human-centered designers, instructional designers, and program delivery experts. To evaluate impact and prove the viability of scaling up the new program, Mentem developed a unique learning analytics platform that measured individual and cohort performance over time, leveraging learner management system analytics, project results, and coach feedback. The platform also provides automated interventions, or nudges, to individuals and coaches to drive program engagement and behavior change. Transformative results For DRNSW, the results exceeded expectations—and in record time—with over 90 percent employee satisfaction and 85 percent of participants reporting improved applied skills. The 8-week courses are now scaling across DRNSW. “Other agencies couldn’t believe we built, piloted and started scaling this entire new approach to capability building in six months when this can typically take two or three years in government,” Donna says. “It was a phenomenal delivery.” Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. These types of changes, scaled throughout the agency, increased productivity and delivered improved services for constituents. Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. The program has already been recognized for its impact and employee-centric approach, winning the Best in Class award in the public-sector category from Good Design Australia, one of the most prestigious design awards in the world. But the biggest testament to its success is the difference it made in the careers of the employees. “You have to realize, this has absolutely changed people’s lives,“ says Donna. Participants reported very high levels of increased confidence in performing their work, value from their coaches and overall satisfaction with the program. “The program was very different from anything I’ve done before,” says Charlene, who completed the program. “The coaching was my highlight of the week.” “To do these jobs, the way everything’s going digital, you need to upskill to get there,” says Glenn, another participant. “I thought, ‘wow, this program is for me.’” The stakes for DRNSW were high—delivering government services that drive value for citizens is essential. But for corporate institutions, it could very much be a question of survival. “If a government agency like DRNSW can make such a major shift with a traditionally non-digital workforce, then enterprises can meet the moment too.” says Roland Dillon, a partner with McKinsey’s Public & Social Sector practice based in Melbourne. “Not doing so could lead to an existential crisis as competitors not only leapfrog the market, but do so while taking talent that is hungry to learn and develop in an increasingly digital world.” Related Articles Future of  Work Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "A government agency in Australia, DRNSW, has partnered with McKinsey to develop a Digital Skills Program addressing the growing skills gap exacerbated by the pandemic.

Many of them shop at Makro, a well-known Thai wholesaler, to meet that demand. The global pandemic has highlighted the essential role these wholesale suppliers play in society—and the opportunity they have, to accelerate their own digital transformations, build new e-commerce capabilities, and better serve customers. When leaders at CP AXTRA Public Company Limited decided to make a digital transformation, they partnered with McKinsey to identify the right strategy, lead with technology, and ensure their transformation would endure. The opportunity The first B2B online platform of its kind Makro was only capturing 10 percent of buyers’ share of wallet. Their customers typically went to other suppliers, from smaller vegetable producers to wet markets, to fulfill their commercial needs. “That adds a lot of operational overhead for them, causing a lack of efficiency in running their businesses,” says Tirayu Songvetkasem, chief digital officer of CP AXTRA. The advent of the pandemic accelerated these challenges and helped create momentum to solve for this customer need. We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working. “Makro comes from a very classic business background,” says Paul Howe, group chief information officer of CP AXTRA . “We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working.” How it was done Building products, teams, and a trust-based relationship Leap by McKinsey experts partnered with CP AXTRA to build a new digital platform where business owners could access a real-time view of wholesale inventory from hundreds of suppliers in a single app. Known as Makro PRO, the platform offers streamlined goods-purchasing for hotels, restaurants, and cafes. “Building Makro PRO from scratch was a new experience for us. For the platform to be successful, we needed a very solid and future-ready technology stack and architecture,” says Yanawee Sarotnunjeen, a product owner at Makro PRO. “We worked with McKinsey to help us accelerate the technology build and make it secure and highly scalable. McKinsey brought in expert digital talent, including product builders and strategists, software engineers, data scientists and designers—and embedded them within our team. Today the technology that supports Makro PRO has been embedded into other parts of our organization.” As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth. After the initial build, CP AXTRA knew it had to build its own tech talent bench to sustain and scale the platform. “We worked with McKinsey to hire and build tech capabilities systematically across different roles and seniority levels,” says Yanawee. “In six months, we grew the Makro PRO team from 0 to 60 people.” Over the project, McKinsey helped CP AXTRA to embed upskilling and professional development into the fabric of the organization’s culture, building capabilities of more than 200 colleagues who are dedicated to Makro PRO, and updating compensation and benefits for the company. As Dymfke Kuijpers, a McKinsey senior partner who leads our retail work globally and our consumer work in Asia explains: “As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth themselves. In the end, tech is never the bottleneck—a lack of people and capabilities are.” Uncovering pain points Building a minimum viable product from scratch “We were true partners across each and every part of the business build, working as one team,” says Tomas Laboutka, a McKinsey expert associate partner. “This kind of collaboration made it easy to share ideas, test and iterate quickly, and ultimately create a trust-based relationship that was critical as we worked remotely most of the time.” The impact Unlocking opportunities for employees, small farmers, and businesses alike Over the last two years, CP AXTRA has reskilled more than 200 employees to support its omni-channel business and Makro PRO platform, which now processes thousands of orders daily with tens of thousands of products available on the platform. Elsewhere, CP AXTRA expands the opportunity for sellers like small farmers to reach customers. “This impact is a result of a shared vision and excitement that we have with CP AXTRA for building a new business that can benefit many local businesses–the heartbeat of the Thai economy,” Tomas says. As Noppamas Sivakriskul, a McKinsey senior partner and the managing partner of our Thailand office, says: “This is a brand I’ve grown up with and loved.

While 40 to 45 percent of those chats usually get resolved by the current classic chatbot, that still leaves another 16,500 customers a week needing to speak with a live agent for help. This can leave customers with potentially longer waiting times as they’re only able to get live help for non-urgent requests during working hours. Generative AI’s ability to interact with human language in ways simply not possible before created an opportunity for teams from QuantumBlack, McKinsey's AI arm, and ING to explore how advanced chatbot technology could be used to improve the customer experience, giving customers the assistance they need immediately. This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry. From idea to impact The Solution Developing advanced chatbot capabilities A joint ING and McKinsey team worked closely together for seven weeks to build a generative AI chatbot that offered customers immediate tailored help while maintaining clear guardrails to mitigate risk. The team started with an in-depth analysis of the existing chatbot to identify specific challenges. The final solution consisted of a multi-step pipeline to generate the best answer for the customer including knowledge retrieval from available data stores and a ranking of potential answers by helpfulness. In the case when several helpful answers arose, the system would offer multiple options to the customer – a process called disambiguation. Lastly, before any answer was sent to the customer, a series of guardrails was applied. In order to do this, ING risk stakeholders were brought into this process from the very start and ING-specific guardrails (to avoid giving advice on mortgages and investment products, for example) were built using out-of-the-box tools from QuantumBlack Labs , our AI and machine learning innovation hub. The gen AI chatbot was released on testing days to 10 percent of real customers in the Netherlands who were using the support chat function on the mobile app. It offered a customer experience that was demonstrably superior to the classic chatbot, providing customers with much more detailed and tailored responses, and helping them resolve their queries faster. Since launching in September 2023, thousands of customers have interacted with the new gen AI chatbot, making it the first-of-its-kind real-life customer-facing pilot conducted in Europe. “By prioritizing real customer needs, security, and ease of use, ING was able to develop a bespoke customer support tool that gives users the best possible experience,” says ING chief operating officer Marnix van Stiphout. The Impact At the forefront of gen AI applications in banking When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers. “When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers,” says McKinsey senior partner and co-leader of the Global Banking and Securities Practice Stephanie Hauser . As part of a broader effort, ING focused on capability building across more than 50 support functions – in the Risk department, Contact Center department, and Analytics Office and Technology – giving ING a lighthouse case to more broadly scale their gen AI efforts. Working together, the ING and McKinsey team created a path to double performance of the chatbot in the next six months, build a scalable model that can be extended to all other ING countries, and setup a technical foundation for ING to address a wide set of gen AI use-cases across the Group. The efforts helped define a blueprint to scale across ten markets with the potential to impact more than 37 million customers across 40 countries. “This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry,” says Bahadir Yilmaz, ING Chief Analytics Officer. “Gen AI technology will further evolve and we feel well-positioned to leverage those developments in order to offer the customer the best experience and remain a technology leader in our industry.” Lessons Learned Let’s connect Andrea Del Miglio Senior PartnerMilan Carlo Giovine PartnerLondon Stephanie Hauser Senior PartnerLondon Mohcine Ouass PartnerAmsterdam Niels Van der Wildt PartnerLondon Related Generative AI QuantumBlack Labs", "summary": "ING has implemented a generative AI chatbot, developed with McKinsey, to enhance customer support in the Netherlands.

It oversees a vast network of passenger airlines and aviation service companies. 2023 ESG Report: Accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth for all Up until 2022, Lufthansa housed its data across 14 separate ERP applications. This meant that their spend management solution was able to provide an overview at a high level. The company recognized that if they could gain more transparency across these data sources, they would be able to identify actionable spend insights at more granular levels across the organization. Lufthansa wanted to track more accurately what they were sourcing and paying for; this would open a channel to strengthen their procurement strategies, help identify more savings, and better understand their carbon footprint. “Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems,” says Holger Koenig, enterprise architect for Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “We wanted to break down data silos, simplify the delivery of trusted data faster across all our systems, and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources.” In 2022, leaders began working with McKinsey on a SaaS solution. It would need to play well with their own implementation of SAP’s Business Technology Platform (BTP) and translate siloed data streams into a consolidated, global view of procurement spend. It was called Spendscape. The Solution A fully integrated SaaS software Spendscape provides a comprehensive understanding of procurement spending. McKinsey adapted it to integrate with SAP’s BTP to enable data and analytics-driven management and create holistic visibility across the supply chain. Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems. We wanted to break down data silos... and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources. “Sophisticated organizations require superior data and insights for decision making. Procurement has gotten significantly more complex with carbon emission targets, managing supply risk, and inflation and deflation factors coming into play,” says McKinsey partner Björn-Uwe Mercker . “We now have a lot of volatility in the market, which drives the need for a super-fast reaction time. To do this, you need a data model and analytics that can keep up.” Fully integrating the Spendscape SaaS software onto SAP’s platform would create a 360-degree view of Lufthansa’s procurement performance. First implemented at Lufthansa Technik, a business focused on maintenance and repair of aircraft, and now being rolled out across the group, the tool is creating greater spend transparency across sourcing systems, simplifying data integration processes, and informing supplier negotiations to help reduce costs. For example, future purchasing decisions could be made using not just a full picture of external costs and spending across the value chain but also with the added layers of near-real-time data on price volatility and carbon emissions -- leading to smarter decision making and procurement across the board. Once fully realized across the group, the successful implementation of this tool could have far-reaching implications. It will provide better metrics across operations, including risk analytics, supplier negotiation, working capital, monitoring of material cost and procurement performance, among other areas. “With Spendscape, we aspire to build one comprehensive spend analytics platform for Lufthansa, fully embedding it into our IT architecture strategy,” says Lennart May, senior director procurement, Lufthansa Group. “This will deliver actionable insights and be integrated with future systems.” This reduces the number of tech components they need to use on the backend and allows for a solution that’s fast and scalable for future systems. The Impact Optimizing cost and carbon reduction decisions Spendscape has already uncovered actionable spend insights for Lufthansa Technik, where it was first deployed. It has also made it easier to collaborate across business units and provided a tool for data model changes and near-real time cash position management. The impact goes beyond financial and operational improvements. With the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive taking effect at the start of 2024, Lufthansa also needs to strengthen and prioritize capabilities and transparency around upstream Scope 3 emissions reporting. Spendscape unites procurement data from more than ten ERP systems into a single taxonomy. The result is a searchable source of truth combining information on carbon footprint across categories, down to the consumption and invoice level. This made it possible for Lufthansa to create comprehensive Scope 3 emissions transparency and collaborate more effectively with suppliers to improve reporting accuracy and optimize decisions for both carbon reduction and cost savings. “This is one of the more sophisticated use cases that goes well beyond classic spend reporting ,” says Björn. “Spendscape’s ability to create more transparency around Scope 3 emissions shows just how powerful a sophisticated data landscape can be in transforming the way businesses are run.” Related case studies McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation Building a next-generation carbon platform to accelerate the path to net zero Let’s connect Björn-Uwe Mercker PartnerMunich", "summary": "Lufthansa is leveraging Spendscape, a SaaS solution integrated with SAP's platform, to consolidate procurement data from multiple sources, enhancing spend transparency and carbon emissions tracking.

A growing number of companies with long-term carbon reduction strategies are turning to carbon credits to hold themselves accountable for their more immediate carbon footprint. As a result, demand is expected to increase 15-fold by 2030 and 100-fold by 2050, according to the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets , a private-sector-led initiative informed by McKinsey knowledge and advisory support. Within the next decade, the overall market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth upwards of $50 billion. And yet, the process for identifying, vetting, buying, and managing carbon credits around the world has proven labor-intensive and hard to scale for many companies. It often requires them to conduct their own due diligence for each project they consider funding. This nascent market includes an evolving and often subjective definition of quality, varying degrees of carbon removal permanence, lack of price transparency, and uncalculated risk. Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants. In the face of such growing demand and complexity, the private equity firm and global alternative asset manager TPG saw the need for a more sophisticated approach to accessing carbon markets. Leadership at TPG Rise Climate, TPG’s dedicated climate-focused private equity fund, saw an opportunity to leverage the tools of more mature markets—diversification, active management, and risk management—to address barriers to scaling efficient voluntary carbon markets. They partnered with McKinsey to build a new platform that would fill critical gaps in the market. What’s behind a Rubicon Carbon Tonne? Rubicon Carbon creates diversified portfolios of high-quality carbon credits called Rubicon Carbon Tonnes or RCTs. These portfolios are offered as curated baskets of credits or can be customized to fit a company's net-zero plan. The RCT is designed to reduce risks and increase options for climate-ambitious corporate buyers. Rubicon Carbon offers three curated RCT portfolios: nature-based emissions avoidance and reductions, industrial emissions reductions, and carbon removal. The RCT uses the tools, logic, and lessons of finance to enable companies to invest safely in carbon credits. “Rubicon Carbon constructs and oversees collections of high-quality carbon credits that have gone through a professional vetting process and are monitored on an ongoing basis,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane. “Their model essentially provides carbon credits as a service, allowing their customers to seamlessly access market-leading capabilities and tools.” “Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane . “TPG and McKinsey asked: How can we partner to build the next generation carbon platform and do it fast enough to create a market leader in a rapidly evolving space?” McKinsey worked with TPG to create Rubicon Carbon , an easy-to-use, transparent, enterprise-grade digital platform that offers innovative, high-quality corporate carbon products at scale in order to accelerate global sustainability and carbon removal. From idea to impact The Solution An innovative risk-adjusted carbon credit portfolio Over the course of less than 12 months, we worked alongside TPG to build and launch the Rubicon Carbon platform, applying a real capital markets approach to innovation in carbon markets. This included market research and segmentation, developing the business and product concept, using Leap business building strategies , business planning and execution, and helping secure sponsor launch funding. The work centered on establishing Rubicon Carbon as an enterprise-grade partner that brings sophisticated capabilities to corporate customers so that they don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every carbon credit transaction. Priorities to get there included coming up with a science-based approach to identifying high-quality credits, vetting the numerous attributes that drive quality and value to customers, and navigating the shifting landscape of risks in the market by actively managing baskets of credits over their life cycle. “Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time,” says Rubicon Carbon chief science officer Dr. Jennifer Jenkins. “By including a diversified portfolio of carbon projects, applying rigorous quality guardrails, and conducting ongoing monitoring and risk adjustments, we’re able to lower the risk assumed by buyers.” Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here. Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors. Over the course of six months, our team helped co-create a tech infrastructure and platform that integrated transaction management, carbon credit custody, customer portfolio management, and full enterprise technology architecture. The work included corporate onboarding and accounted for the necessary compliance features along with bespoke carbon credit purchasing and inventory management. “Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here,” says McKinsey associate partner Charles Riesenberg. “Previously, buyers in the market had to find and diligence individual carbon credit projects in different parts of the world, which creates an incredibly complex market.  Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors.” The Impact Connecting companies to meaningful climate projects TPG and Rubicon Carbon accelerated the platform’s time to market and customer acquisition over the course of six months. In addition to overseeing the asset management platform build, McKinsey helped refine the product and offering strategy, designed initial product portfolios, and helped design the new company’s org structure. What began as 25 full-time employees, two MVP products, and a coalition of 15 corporate launch partners (including McKinsey), has now grown to become a market leader in next-generation carbon solutions including four distinct product offerings and a $1 billion capital mobilization goal. Rubicon Carbon has created a reliable way for companies with long-term carbon reduction goals to make a more immediate impact in offsetting their emissions. Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time. It's already making a difference around the world. For example, through one project alone, 150,000 hectares have been preserved in Borneo. Elsewhere, methane emissions are being cut in Bangladesh, and 5,000 acres in Africa are being reforested to expand the habitat for endangered gorillas. \"It’s clear that companies must reduce emissions within their value chain, but to balance remaining emissions that can't be eliminated right now, we also need to scale high-quality carbon credits,” says Rubicon Carbon CEO Thomas Montag. \"Rubicon Carbon helps direct corporate funds toward meaningful climate projects in need of capital and moves us closer to reaching the ambitious net zero goals our planet needs.\" Let’s Connect Sean Kane Charles Riesenberg Related case studies From farm to tablet: Building a new business to solve an old challenge Made in Africa: Catalyzing stronger, sustainable, and inclusive economies How a global components manufacturer built an ambitious carbon reduction roadmap", "summary": "Rubicon Carbon, developed by TPG and McKinsey, offers a sophisticated platform for companies to access high-quality carbon credits.

The work included understanding potential points of exclusion and creating guidelines – what Starbucks now calls the Inclusive Spaces Framework – to make spaces more accessible for persons with disabilities. “The entirety of this work was not just about building something that’s just specific to Starbucks,” says McKinsey partner Anne Kronschnabl. “They wanted to develop guidelines to help change the retail industry at large. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it.” The Solution Minimizing points of exclusion McKinsey worked with Starbucks to identify barriers that may exist for people with disabilities throughout the customer journey. Heatmaps showed pain points around entering the store, ordering, and navigating spaces like the drive-thru and restrooms. Then the team worked on ideating potential solutions to eliminate or minimize points of exclusion throughout those spaces. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it. One critical element of the approach was that persons with lived experiences were an integral part of the team, participating in every step of the work. “We were very intentional about who we had on our working team and made sure we had people representing different disability types involved in ideation and prioritization,” says Anne. “We made sure to have lots of involvement from individuals with lived experiences.” This led to a set of proposed changes such as wider spaces to allow easier access for wheelchair users, better signage in critical locations and at varying heights, and a variety of sound and lighting zones to accommodate varying sensory needs. Starbucks also wanted to focus on the employee experience. We looked at the employee journey and redesigned employee spaces with accessibility as a priority. More inclusive equipment was introduced, including a new drip brewer designed with a larger dial and visual and haptic feedback. The Impact A new set of accessibility guidelines In February of 2024, Starbucks opened its first retail space designed using this inclusive spaces framework in Washington, DC. It now plans to scale the design efforts across more stores. It’s a significant commitment. This year Starbucks plans to grow its U.S. footprint by around 4 percent, with plans to open around 600 new stores in addition to the existing 16,000 stores across the U.S. Growth plans will include the use of these new accessibility guidelines so that all newly built and renovated Starbucks company-operated stores in the U.S. will incorporate these more inclusive design elements. The retailer is also thinking beyond its own walls. Starbucks plans to share this inclusive design framework with other retailers and is standing up an Inclusive Spaces Coalition. The hope is that more retailers across the U.S. and beyond will use these learnings to make their built environments as inclusive as possible for customers and employees. “This framework defines how Starbucks will help expand independence, choice, and ease for all people across physical and digital spaces,\" says Starbucks CEO, and McKinsey alum, Laxman Narasimhan in a LinkedIn post . \"Developed alongside a diverse community of customers, partners, and accessibility experts, the framework will be open-source to help expand accessibility across the entire retail industry.\" Our People Anne Kronschnabl Becca Coggins Related case studies 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Protecting workers through award-winning design", "summary": "Starbucks aims to enhance accessibility in its stores by going beyond ADA requirements, collaborating with McKinsey to create the Inclusive Spaces Framework.

This week, nonprofit Opportunity@Work and the Ad Council have launched a nationwide campaign to ‘ Tear the Paper Ceiling ’ and encourage employers to change hiring practices. McKinsey is providing pro bono support to the effort through data and analytics tools that enable recruiters to recognize STARs and their skills. “While companies scramble to find talent amid a perceived skills gap, many of their job postings have needlessly excluded half of the workers in the country who have the skills for higher-wage work,” says Byron Auguste , founder of Opportunity@Work and a former senior partner at McKinsey. “Companies like the ones we're proud to call partners in this effort—and those we hope will join—can lead the way by tapping into skilled talent from a far wider range of backgrounds.” McKinsey has driven extensive research on skills-based hiring and human capital , and built data-driven solutions that help employers implement new ways of screening for knowledge, skills, and capacity to learn. “A few years ago, we looked at many talent solutions in the market. There was a real risk of hard-wiring outdated notions of being a skilled worker,” says McKinsey partner Carolyn Pierce , who leads the technology team in the People and Organizational Performance practice . “Those systems gave little credit even to our own team members for skills learned on the job.” People & Organizational Performance: Equipping people and organizations to unleash sustained performance Carolyn and her team began collaborating with Opportunity@Work to prove the value and transferability of skills developed through work experience. “The Opportunity@Work team has done some incredible research that makes the business case for hiring STARs into today’s most in-demand jobs” says Carolyn. Our pro bono support will help make those insights more widely available to employers. “We increasingly hear from employers that they want to recruit from the STARs talent pool,” says Shad Ahmed, COO of Opportunity@Work. “But they need practical, data-driven tools to replace degree screens and hire STARs. The portal we are building with support from McKinsey will help employers identify which jobs should be open to STARs and help them source from this valuable talent pool. It’s a key part of our mission to create vital technology infrastructure wired for inclusion.” McKinsey is committed to tearing the ‘paper ceiling’ in our own hiring practices. “We have made significant investments to ensure that our own talent culture is both distinctive and inclusive, attracting and developing talent from a wide range of backgrounds,” says Katy George , senior partner and CHRO of McKinsey. “We are investing in more ways to recruit, hire, and grow STARs through a holistic approach that recognizes candidates’ skills and experience, problem-solving ability and intrinsic capabilities.” McKinsey’s technology organization is at the forefront of this effort, with many entry-level roles already open to STARs who have the necessary knowledge and skills. “We already have technologists at the firm—from entry-level through partner—who are STARs,” says Katy. “Our technology teams work on important and challenging problems, from helping organizations reduce their carbon footprint to improving worker safety. Our best path to solving these problems is to attract talented people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Our recruiting teams are actively working to make more STARs aware of these opportunities and encourage them to apply.” Creating more opportunities for STARs requires more than simply removing degree requirements from job descriptions. “We are scaling support for apprenticeships, bootcamps, and training programs to accelerate pathways for STARs into our firm” adds Katy. “The programs will help STAR talent build any additional skills needed for success at McKinsey and beyond.” There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential. We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up. Byron is hopeful that having McKinsey as a sponsor of this campaign will encourage more employers to change their talent practices. “A lot of organizations know that McKinsey is very data driven. It’s a strong signal that they are helping to build better ways to screen for talent and creating opportunities for STARs through their own hiring,” he says. Challenging the misconceptions associated with not having a college degree is key to helping more people tear through the paper ceiling. “Screening for a degree is one way to find people with skills and the capacity to learn—the problem is that you’re also screening for who had the right social and economic conditions in place to attend college,” says Carolyn. “There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential,” Carolyn adds. “We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up.” related No such thing as a dead-end job, new McKinsey research finds Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey is supporting the \"Tear the Paper Ceiling\" campaign to promote hiring skilled workers from diverse backgrounds, known as STARs.

Scaling supply chains and infrastructure, developing analytics tools to assess climate risk, reskilling workers in highly carbon-dependent markets, and more will have a massive impact on our ability to stabilize global temperatures in line with the 1.5C-degree pathway. To help our clients reach their sustainability and broader ESG goals, we have launched Sustainability Academy , a capability-building program that helps organizations better equip their talent for the net zero transition. “Making our economic system more sustainable and more inclusive is an imperative that is felt by all types of stakeholders, from governments and regulators, to clients, suppliers, and end consumers,” says partner Pietro Sorrentino , who helps lead Sustainability Academy. “Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that: help companies accelerate change by supporting them in building new knowledge for their employees.” The program was designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy —our capability building center of excellence—and follows a simple approach: acquire, apply, and sustain. First, Sustainability Academy offers formal learning experiences to help talent acquire new knowledge and skills through practice and feedback. Second, teams apply these mindsets and capabilities in a real-world context, where impact materializes. Finally, we help organizations sustain new practices and habits to unlock lasting behavioral change. Sustainability Academy has launched with two foundational programs. Our Executive Masterclass kickstarts transformations by aligning senior executives with the mindsets and skills required to deliver their sustainability agendas. Sustainability Transformation Essentials, meanwhile, helps clients develop enterprise-wide awareness of core sustainability concepts, including the climate transition, solving the net-zero equation, and capturing new business opportunities. The program is already driving impact with clients. Recently, we partnered with a Fortune 500 company to accelerate their net-zero journey, helping them become an industry ESG leader. In this case, the client had articulated clear sustainability targets—including reaching net zero for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. But leaders needed to equip their teams with the practical skill sets needed to engage both internally and externally with stakeholders and suppliers. This is a common challenge: industry benchmarks show that in some sectors, nearly 100 percent of companies have defined and communicated sustainability strategies, but only 40 percent believe they have sufficient internal knowledge and capabilities to achieve their targets. Given that about 90 percent of our client’s emissions fell into Scope 3 (within the supply chain and not directly owned by the organization), equipping their talent with capabilities to engage their suppliers was particularly important. Sustainability Academy The company asked McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy to help their talent build the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they needed to engage with their suppliers to reduce emissions across the value chain. Together, we co-developed a multimodal journey—integrating fieldwork, digital learning, and live workshops—to help the client’s category managers prepare for conversations with suppliers. This journey looked at key emissions categories, such as distribution and logistics, identifying the sustainability opportunities to discuss with suppliers and internal stakeholders. It also provided modules on how to best lead the supplier discussions and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The same client also sought to increase spend with diverse companies by more than $1 billion across their tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We partnered with the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion team to create robust diversity programs and track against diversity targets. These efforts culminated in a virtual supplier summit with more than 200 suppliers and more than 1,000 internal and external attendees. Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that... These efforts delivered significant impact on both the sustainability and inclusion fronts. Supplier commitments to science-based targets increased by more than 50 percent from the baseline, and gains were made on supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion, with additional commitments on tier 2 reporting and identification of new business opportunities with tier 1 diverse suppliers. “Completing the online training modules, supported by the virtual forum sessions and open office hours, helped our client’s people build a fact-base for working with their suppliers, which enabled them to have productive conversations at the supplier summit,” says partner Maria Fernandez . “Today, this work is the foundation upon which their multi-year ESG transformation resides.” If your organization is interested in working with Sustainability Academy, please email us . related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey's Sustainability Academy aims to upskill workers for the net-zero transition by providing capability-building programs.

With the evisceration of manufacturing jobs, it needed a major transformation. In 2011, the state had a novel idea. Using profits from the beverage industry, Ohio formed a new entity—a first-of-its-kind, state-authorized non-profit—to stimulate economic growth through new industries: JobsOhio . Over the next decade, the state saw nearly one million jobs created or protected. McKinsey was a key early partner, helping develop JobsOhio’s growth plan that identified ten sectors with opportunities for employment, such as aerospace and aviation, healthcare, logistics and distribution, technology, and financial services. In 2010, Ohio ranked 49th for job growth rate in these ten sectors. By 2022, they ranked 20th in job growth rate and had added $13 billion in payroll. The state’s job creation was its best ever, but JobsOhio wanted to ensure its strategy would be effective going forward. In 2018, the initiative asked McKinsey to issue a report evaluating its performance. “JobsOhio was in a class by itself in terms of economic development organizations as far as dollars per job, attracting companies, capital investments, and more,” says Ben Safran , a partner at McKinsey who worked on the report. “But we also found it needed to address approaching headwinds in the broader macro economy.” Brendan Buescher , a McKinsey senior partner based in Cleveland, says the findings encouraged JobsOhio to think locally. “They were certainly performing well against comparable organizations,” says Brendan, “but we urged them to measure success against the needs of Ohioans.” The case for inclusive growth The report helped shape JobsOhio’s 2.0 strategy, which expanded its industry-focus to include a new emphasis on workforce, innovation, infrastructure and investment throughout the state. From this, JobsOhio developed Innovation Districts in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—, multi-organization partnerships plan to create 60,000 jobs and establishing Ohio as a global leader in healthcare, life sciences, and technology in these three regions. As the new strategy was getting off the ground, COVID-19 rocked the state’s economy. Partnering with McKinsey again, JobsOhio quickly created a strategy for the pandemic economy, leading to the launch of Ohio to Work . Designed for displaced workers, Ohio to Work offered skills assessments, career coaching, virtual career fairs, and connection with employers who had signed on to interview or hire workers from the program. Specifically, McKinsey helped JobsOhio develop a unique program for reskilling and upskilling for higher-tech jobs: JobsOhio paid for tuition costs for technical degrees, and enrollees gradually repaid JobsOhio through a marginal percentage of their income—if they got a job that paid a good wage. Those repaid funds are not kept by JobsOhio; instead, the organization invests them in the next cohort. The program has been a success. Its funds have continued to replenish because of the high employment rate of participants. “With this strategy, not only is Ohio coming back strong from COVID-19, but Ohioans have the opportunity to pursue new careers they might have never thought possible,” says Ben. “A woman who had been a back-office worker and lost her job is now a nurse assistant—a whole new, stable career that feels like a calling. There are many powerful stories like this.” As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years. Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Most recently, the decade of growth and economic investment in Ohio helped attract a new investment from Intel, which announced earlier this year that it would be opening a new chip manufacturing plant in Central Ohio . This huge project is the largest single private-sector company investment in the state. It will create 3,000 new jobs at the plant with an average salary of $135,000. “As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years,” says JP Nauseef , president & CEO of JobsOhio. “Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The turnaround of the state’s jobs growth, Ben adds, suggests a potential way forward for other challenging situations. “Their success has been a paradigm shift,” says Ben Safran. “They are a model for growth in a changing economy.” related Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story", "summary": "JobsOhio, established in 2011, revitalized Ohio's economy post-Great Recession by creating nearly one million jobs.

They had come to learn what would happen when they cranked the big mill up to a work rate that had never been tried. The possibility of causing problems at the mill weighed on everyone’s mind. The team members had initially resisted the idea of running the mill faster. They wanted to keep the stockpile of ore that feeds the mill from dropping below the minimum size they had long maintained. Their concern was that a too-small stockpile would hamper the mill’s performance. Whether the minimum stockpile size actually helped the mill run better was another matter. No one really knew for sure. Nor could the mill’s managers and staff say what would happen if the stockpile shrank to less than the traditional minimum. As the weeks went by, the copper-ore concentrating mill sustained a faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. What they did know is that a custom-built artificial-intelligence (AI) model, loaded with three years’ worth of operating data from the mill and programmed to look for operational tweaks that would boost output, kept saying copper production would rise if the mill were fed with more ore per minute. To the mill operators, that notion sounded logical enough—except that it didn’t account for the minimum stockpile size they had in mind. But the model didn’t know, or care, about minimum stockpile size or any of the mill operators’ other ideas about how the mill ought to be run. With permission from company executives, the crew members at the Bagdad site decided to turn up the pace of the mill as the model had suggested. They also prepared to ramp up mining and crushing activities so the stockpile of ore wouldn’t run out. At ten o’clock in the morning, a technician clicked a control on his computer screen to speed up the system of conveyor belts carrying chunks of ore from the crusher to the stockpile and from the stockpile to the mill. Everyone in the room kept watch on the 13 oversize monitors in the control room, which were lit up with readings from hundreds of performance sensors placed around the mill. The quantity of ore grinding through the mill rose. No warnings went up. Twelve hours passed. The mill held steady. Even when its stockpile of ore dipped below the usual minimum, the accelerated delivery of ore from the crusher and the mine allowed the mill to keep going. As the weeks went by, the mill sustained the faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. “That was the breakthrough we’d been looking for,” Justin Cross, the Bagdad site’s general manager, told us. “Once we started to run the mill at full speed, we knew we could get results from more of the recommendations that the model was making.” The ‘age of the operator’ The story of how Freeport-McMoRan learned to rely on an AI model as much as the intuition of veteran mining engineers and metallurgists might not raise eyebrows outside the tech industry. For mining companies, though, it illustrates a quiet but profound shift into an era we think of as the “age of the operator,” when the best-run businesses wring profits out of low-grade ore that miners would have waved off as waste just ten years ago. One mine where Freeport-McMoRan had been processing declining ore grades is Bagdad, a sprawling Arizona complex where prospectors staked their first claims in 1882. Bagdad’s reserves of higher-grade ore have been depleted for some time, but Freeport-McMoRan has sustained the mine’s production of copper by making various process improvements. By the end of 2017, executives believed that Bagdad had gotten as efficient as it could get with its existing equipment, so they reasoned that adding capacity would be the surest way to get even more copper out of the site. Early in 2018, they started planning a $200 million capital expansion of Bagdad’s ore-concentrating mill that would lift production by 20 percent. Copper prices were high at the time. The investment looked certain to pay off. Then copper prices dropped from a five-year peak of around $3.30 per pound in early June to $2.75 or so a month later. All of a sudden, investing $200 million to expand Bagdad no longer seemed practical. Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase the site’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Instead, Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase Bagdad’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Discovering improvements at an efficient mine wouldn’t be easy. But Freeport-McMoRan had plenty of high-quality information to study. Around ten years before, Bert Odinet, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief information officer, coordinated an effort to standardize the way that each site measures and reports its performance and to build a central data warehouse for storing those measurements. Several years later, maintenance teams lobbied for the installation of additional network equipment and performance sensors on the company’s trucks, power shovels, and stationary machines. The teams would manually download data from those sensors to the data warehouse so they could further sharpen their maintenance practices and improve the functioning of equipment. When wireless mesh networks became cost effective and reliable, Freeport-McMoRan installed them at all its sites. Now the company could capture and correlate second-by-second performance readings in the data warehouse, all in real time. “We learned things we’d have never predicted,” Odinet said. “That project taught us to be more receptive to what the data was telling us. And it gave us the confidence to try more complicated analyses.” With advanced analytics and AI techniques , Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of data it collected, identify even more operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in the field. Bagdad looked like a good proving ground for this method. The site is staffed with creative, open-minded engineers, metallurgists, and equipment operators who stood out at Freeport-McMoRan for their willingness to try new things. Their earlier efforts to enhance Bagdad’s metallurgical processes, for example, had resulted in higher copper recovery. And Cross, Bagdad’s general manager, was a natural tinkerer who liked to spend his free time outfitting his pickup truck for off-road use and milling mesquite logs into lumber for a house he planned to build himself. Since joining Freeport-McMoRan in 2006, Cross had led a series of projects to streamline operations at the company’s mines. Would you like to learn more about McKinsey Analytics ? It also helped that Bagdad’s operations were stable. With few equipment problems or process hiccups to straighten out, workers would have time to help increase copper production. Executives felt that promising opportunities to boost Bagdad’s production could be found in one part of the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, a noisy facility where huge milling machines and flotation cells bubbling with chemical solutions turn grapefruit-size rocks containing around 0.4 percent copper into a fine-ground mix of 25 percent copper and 75 percent rock. The mill’s technicians ran the facility strictly by the book, a set of operating instructions that Freeport-McMoRan engineers in Phoenix had developed. There had to be ways of building on those instructions that would better the mill’s performance. After talking things over with engineers and operations specialists from Bagdad and from headquarters, Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson and CFO Kathleen Quirk decided to let the crew at Bagdad work with McKinsey on a new kind of mining project: data mining in an agile way. Learning agile The project called for more than sophisticated data science. It also called for a new approach to solving tricky operational problems. “Usually when we run operational projects, we overengineer them. We test every conceivable scenario, build in safeguards, and do everything we can to ensure that a process change will result in an improvement before we make it,” Cross observed. “It’s a dependable way to get good results. But it takes a huge amount of time, effort, and capital investment.” McKinsey’s consultants reckoned that the crew at Bagdad might get better results, more quickly, by carrying out the analytics project differently. They introduced the idea of working under agile principles , which emphasize quick development of functional solutions that teams then improve, little by little, according to feedback from users. The general manager assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. Another essential feature of agile methods is face-to-face collaboration within well-rounded teams . Cross assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. The composition of the team allowed it to tap the expertise and account for the interests of each division of Bagdad that its work might affect. It also enabled the team to contend better with challenges that involved different divisions and couldn’t be solved by one division alone. The team’s agile approach was to work in “sprints”—two-week bouts of activity in which the team conceived a data-modeling function or operational change, tested it, and learned what would make it better. As improvements came to light, the team would add them to a backlog. Then it would plow through the items on the backlog in subsequent sprints, starting with the easiest, most beneficial tasks. For Bagdad’s crew members, this agile style of working wasn’t just different from business as usual. It represented a radical departure from the way they’d been doing things. “It took us a while to get comfortable with agile,” Cross said. “We had to let go of a lot of old habits.” McKinsey brought in agile coaches to help. The coaches explained the rudiments of agile —building a backlog, deciding what to accomplish in each sprint, holding morning meetings to agree on the work the crew would perform each day and to note any difficulties that might slow it down—but were mainly there\nto join the team’s activities and teach its members to work together in agile ways. Shannon Lijek, a McKinsey partner who specializes in helping organizations apply agile methods, was one of the coaches who came to help the Bagdad team get the hang of agile. “We’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” said McKinsey partner Shannon Lijek. “Agile can be tricky to adopt at first because it isn’t a process you can memorize. It’s a set of principles for minimizing wasted effort and getting more work done. And we’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” Lijek said. One way that Bagdad’s agile team cut out needless effort was by introducing solutions as soon as it had built “minimum viable products,” or MVPs, that were good enough to use, rather than laboring to perfect those products first. “If we’d built the model ourselves, we’d have tried to get it 100 percent right before doing anything with it,” Cross told us. “Shannon and the McKinsey coaches encouraged us to work with solutions that weren’t finished. They’d say, ‘You can get 60 percent of the improvement with an MVP, and that’s a lot. So just start using it. Then you can worry about making it better.’” Introducing AI and agile to mining operations: Lessons from Bagdad By Red Conger Freeport-McMoRan’s effort to increase copper production at Bagdad taught us a good deal about how to use agile methods and AI tools at our sites, where it can be difficult to alter accepted routines. Here are a few things we’re keeping in mind as we expand the use of agile and AI to more of Freeport-McMoRan’s operations: Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan. From predicting to optimizing Once the team Cross formed came together, it began investigating the possibility of improving the mill’s performance. The idea was to spend a month examining data from the mill for patterns that revealed potential improvements. If those improvements looked promising enough, the team would pursue them. Beginning in late June, the Bagdad team and data scientists from McKinsey built a machine-learning model to check whether the mill truly ran as efficiently as people believed. The model, a type of extreme gradient-boosting model, consisted of an ensemble of thousands of decision trees that had been engineered to include a great deal of metallurgical knowledge. The staff at Bagdad and Freeport-McMoRan’s central operations group believed all the ore entering the mill was of the same type. Consequently, they had defined a single “recipe” of lower and upper parameters for the mill’s 42 control settings: the mix of differently sized ore chunks being fed into the mill, the pH level in the flotation cells, and so on. But when the agile team at Bagdad ran the data from the mill’s performance sensors through its model, the members of the team learned something new. From the mill’s perspective, the mine was actually producing seven distinct types of ore. What’s more, the mill’s standard recipe for control settings didn’t match the properties of all those ore types. Ore containing more iron pyrite, for example, would yield more copper if the pH level in the flotation cells were set higher than the recipe prescribed. “Thinking about ore clusters in terms of data from the mill’s instruments, rather than classifications from traditional geology, was a major mind-set shift—and it opened up many new possibilities for improving performance,” said Sean Buckley, a McKinsey partner who led the analytics work. All told, the team’s analysis suggested that adjusting the mill’s controls to suit each of the seven ore types could increase copper production by 10 percent or more. That prospect convinced Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders to let the agile team at Bagdad build an AI model that would look at the ore coming into the mill and suggest control settings to heighten production of copper from that ore. Change that Matters Team members wrote algorithms to discern the connections among the ore type, the operational readings from the plant’s sensors, the amount of ore running through the mill, and the amount of copper recovered. Next, they developed more algorithms to predict the plant’s performance based on measurements from the sensors. After several weeks of development sprints, the team members had raised the accuracy of the model’s performance predictions to 96 percent—high enough to know that the model was properly interpreting the data streaming in from the mill’s sensors and relating it to the mill’s control settings. To determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, staff decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. The team then turned its attention from predicting performance to improving it. Staff began by asking a simple question that no one had asked in some time: What measure of performance do we want to optimize? For years, the team at Bagdad had oriented its decisions and activities toward particular targets for copper production and operating cost. That approach made a certain kind of sense. It meant that Bagdad consistently generated profits. Now, to determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, the team decided to establish a new mandate— maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. Cross and Cory Stevens, Freeport-McMoRan’s vice president of operational improvement, knew that maximizing production could lessen Bagdad’s performance in other areas. The mill’s recovery rate—the percentage of copper extracted from the ore—might drop. Or the whole operation could come to a halt for hours. Stevens went to other executives to explain that Bagdad’s experiment could be costly. The performance numbers they’d see for the next few months might be dismal, he warned. Nonetheless, the executives agreed with Stevens that if Bagdad could achieve the 10 percent increase in production that the model predicted, the short-term cost would be worth it. They gave him the go-ahead to try maximizing production. With that approval, Cross granted Bagdad’s staff the latitude to make operational changes that deviated from standard procedures and could cause the mill to miss its performance targets. Worker safety and equipment integrity were the only areas where no compromises or experiments would be allowed. Any other changes were fair game. A big breakthrough Over a series of iterations during the next month or so, the team conceived, tested, and refined algorithms that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend control settings to maximize copper output. The new algorithms, known as genetic algorithms, used the principles of natural selection to “evolve” settings that would produce the most copper, given a particular type of ore. By early September, the team had expanded the prediction model into an MVP of an optimization model, dubbed TROI, that was capable of issuing recommendations every 12 hours, once for each of the mill’s two daily shifts. When each new set of recommendations came out, the engineers, equipment operators, and metallurgists on the team would huddle and decide what do to with them. TROI was a work in progress, so its earliest recommendations weren’t entirely reliable. At every shift, metallurgists from Freeport-McMoRan and from McKinsey would study the model’s recommendations and question whether they were credible. Then the metallurgists would take note of the problem recommendations so the agile team could look into them. Some recommendations led the team members to discover flaws in TROI’s logic, which they added to their backlog and corrected in subsequent development sprints. Others indicated that the underlying performance data were faulty and prompted the team to look for fixes. “TROI helps us to improve the quality of our instrumentation and highlights sensors that need attention,” said Frank Ochoa, one of Bagdad’s process-control and instrumentation engineers. Most challenging were the model’s recommendations to depart from the operational recipe that the staff at Bagdad had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Most challenging were the recommendations to depart from the operational recipe the staff had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Gradually, as the team fine-tuned TROI, its recommendations became more plausible, and the staff at Bagdad began following them. Yet many of those recommendations resulted in slim performance gains,\nif any. Mid-October arrived. The team was nowhere close to the 10 percent production boost it thought possible. Cross and Stevens decided it was time to act on a weighty recommendation that no one was especially eager to try: speeding the flow of ore from the mine and the crusher to the mill. Cross asked the mine operators to redline their activities—and reassured them that they wouldn’t be blamed for spending more money or triggering operational breakdowns. The mine operators ramped up blasting, even though they had to use more explosives. They queued up trucks to carry rocks to the crushing plant, in violation of a long-standing directive to keep trucks from standing idle. They choke-fed the giant crusher with run-of-mine, or unprocessed, ore to find out how much it could handle. Finally, on October 19, the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate. Right away, copper production jumped 5 percent. TROI had helped the team unlock a record level of performance. Small gains add up Having achieved a major performance gain, Bagdad’s agile team turned to enhancing the model’s ability to recommend mill-control settings that would increase copper production. The agile team reviewed the data model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day and kept working through a backlog of upgrades. Within several weeks, the team had refined the model to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. TROI could already identify which type of ore was running through the mill at any moment. In the next round of sprints, the team added functions to account for other incoming operational data. Each time TROI recommended a set of control settings, the metallurgists at the plant would consider the recommendations, choose which ones to accept, and pass them to shift supervisors and operators, who would adjust the mill’s controls accordingly. Letting the metallurgists decide which recommendations to follow helped the agile team learn more quickly. Occasionally, the metallurgists applied settings that looked questionable just to find out whether they would work. And when the metallurgists rejected the recommended settings, they typed notes into the model to explain their decisions. “TROI doesn’t always give fully accurate recommendations, but it provides a new perspective on how to manage the plant and challenges our assumptions,” said Lulu Raymond, a senior metallurgist at Bagdad. All the while, sensors gauged the mill’s performance. The model’s machine-learning algorithms recorded which settings improved performance and which ones didn’t, and whether the recommendations were helping. The agile team reviewed the model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day, added items to the backlog of upgrades it planned to make, and kept working on those upgrades. By early December, the team had refined TROI to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. It wasn’t long before the metallurgists and mill operators began trying to outsmart TROI. They would monitor the type of ore passing into the mill, anticipate the control settings that the model might suggest, and apply those settings before the model made its twice-daily recommendations (later increased to every three hours). This became a kind of competition: Who can run the mill better than TROI would? Most important, the mill’s production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bagdad’s throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day—10 percent more than the previous quarter—while its copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point and its operations became more stable (exhibit). The following quarter, copper production at Bagdad went up yet again. Those gains should lift Bagdad’s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200 million capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex. We think this is just the beginning for Freeport-McMoRan. Having learned to maintain TROI during the project, the company’s metallurgists and data scientists now run the model themselves, without ongoing support from McKinsey. They study daily and weekly reports that compare the mill’s performance with TROI’s predictions, and they continue enhancing the model’s ability to make recommendations. Freeport-McMoRan executives have also sponsored the creation of a second agile team at Bagdad to test and make process improvements at the mine. This team, too, is working without help from McKinsey, using the agile methods that it learned on the mill project. At another one of Freeport-McMoRan’s Arizona copper mines, Morenci, managers have kicked off an agile and analytics effort like Bagdad’s. And the company will soon launch its most ambitious program of this kind at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in Peru with five times the capacity of Bagdad. The age of the operator is here, and Freeport-McMoRan is adapting to it with agile methods and AI tools. Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan.

But based on trends that have been reshaping other industries, competition in real estate has spread to another area: customer experience. How engaged, productive, comfortable, connected, and safe we feel in our physical environment matters, and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for significant changes in the real estate industry . Practically overnight, for example, physical distancing and the need for contactless interaction have magnified the importance of digital within real estate. Pioneers in the industry have been exploring ways to diversify sources of revenue, pursuing new digitally-enabled business models and focusing on tenant experience. The pandemic has made clear that those that haven’t yet made such investments in underlying capabilities and infrastructure will need to catch up quickly. Leap by McKinsey “The future of real estate is no longer about delivering four walls to tenants,” says RXR CEO Scott Rechler . “Instead, it’s about creating a unique, personalized customer experience that fosters meaningful interactions, collaboration, productivity. Delivering this will require a unique combination of capabilities that seamlessly integrate across the physical and digital realms.” The joint Leap-RXR team has built products and services for residents that enhance their living experiences. One innovation is a new RXR app that is anchored around a resident experience officer. Designed, created, and launched by the team, the app allows residents to manage elements of their personal lives, like moving into an apartment, and use digitally-enabled concierge services for services like housekeeping and grocery delivery. Tenants can also submit and manage maintenance requests through the platform and make rent payments seamlessly. The entire experience is powered by a robust data and analytics infrastructure that is uniquely tailored and personalized, and enables staff to manage buildings in a customer-centric way. “There’s a huge opportunity to get more use out of data that these digital products create,” says Vaibhav Gujral , a McKinsey partner. “We can uniquely personalize services and experiences to tenants based on information that is made available at the right place at the right time.” Real estate is no longer just about four walls and relying on location for value appreciation. On the commercial office side, RXR is implementing new technologies to help monitor energy efficiency and environmental conditions. As companies consider what office space will look like in the return to work after coronavirus, these capabilities have positioned RXR to move with agility. For instance, the infrastructure created by RXR with Leap’s support enabled the company to respond quickly to the coronavirus, including the launch of a new comprehensive, data-driven program initiative called RxWell. “Helping to ensure an environment that prioritizes safety and wellness is particularly important in light of the coronavirus,” Rechler adds. Leap, according to McKinsey partner Jennifer Kilian , is all about bringing start-up thinking to established organizations. “In this case, that meant working with RXR to build its digital muscle,” she says. Jennifer explains that for any business to change how it creates value for customers, a diverse set of skills is needed across design, data science, advanced analytics, and business. The Leap team helped RXR determine which new roles to create and hire for. After outlining the criteria, they sourced and filled positions like software developers, data scientists, and agile coaches to ensure that the capabilities would live on beyond the initial phases of the project. Through our partnership, the company has built proprietary digital capabilities which are especially unique in the real estate industry, which will enable the organization to move with speed and agility. Building new businesses: How incumbents use their advantages to accelerate growth “Digital solutions have democratized access to experiences and conveniences for individuals and companies,” says Clay Cowan , a McKinsey partner. As people have grown accustomed to digital experiences  like online banking, tele-health, or eCommerce for example, “they expect similar from the spaces in which they live, work, play, and shop.” “We see this work as a catalyst for the rest of the industry across geographies,” says Aditya Sanghvi , a McKinsey senior partner. “Our aspiration is for this to set a new standard and benchmark for how real estate developers, owners, and operators start to think creatively about how they can create better experiences for their customers.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Superheating can be tricky to get right. Steel reaches more than 1600 degrees Celsius during superheating, and the ideal temperature range spans only 15 degrees. If the steel comes out too hot, the equipment operators must slow the casting step. If the steel isn’t hot enough, it can “freeze” before it has been cast, which compromises its quality. The frontline operators at the secondary-metallurgy station were used to running the superheating process based on past experiences. They would consider prompts from control systems, which were loaded with standard formulas, and then decide what set points to apply so the steel temperature would end up in the target range. Most of the time, they heated two of every three batches of steel into the optimal range. That “strike rate” allowed them to complete 25 “heats” per day, but it also left room for improvement. Bringing the strike rate up to 85 percent or so would result in 28 to 30 heats per day, enough to boost throughput by roughly 8 to 12 percent, or 600 to 900 daily tons. The opportunity stood out to the plant managers, who had been given a mandate to improve the plant’s performance with advanced analytics. In early 2017, they devised a plan for building analytics models that would help frontline operators get better results from the superheating process and several other activities. Data scientists from Tata Steel and McKinsey used historical information from the plant to build and “train” a superheating-optimization model, which would examine real-time operational data and recommend process set points conducive to a higher strike rate. In addition, managers arranged for some employees to receive classroom training in data science, data engineering, and other advanced-analytics disciplines. At first, the superheating model proposed settings that consistently improved the strike rate. But as the mix of steel orders from customers began to differ from the mix of orders recorded in the model’s training data, the model started to generate faulty recommendations—which frontline operators ceased to follow. Employees who had gone through the classroom training tried to fix the model but found the problems too complex to correct using the basic skills they’d learned. Similar difficulties arose with the models being used elsewhere in the plant. Despite the setback, managers had seen how the advanced-analytics models reduced costs and raised output. Managers also realized that classroom training alone would not prepare employees to sustain those performance improvements. They concluded that the company would need to further cultivate employees’ analytics skills and transform their way of working. Their insight paid off. By building these capabilities, the plant would raise its performance to world-class levels and earn acclaim from the World Economic Forum in July 2019 as one of 44 Lighthouse sites that are leading in the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. What worked and what didn’t: Lessons from Kalinganagar’s analytics program Focus on business improvements, not technology improvements. Kalinganagar expanded its use of analytics quickly by targeting performance gains and building tech solutions to achieve them, rather than looking at available technologies and thinking of how to apply them. Develop analytics talent, instead of outsourcing it. When Kalinganagar’s first-wave analytics models needed updating, the plant didn’t have in-house specialists to fix them. Hands-on training enabled the plant to cultivate the analytics talent that it needed to scale up. Scale analytics to make it a part of everyone’s way of working. Moving beyond pilot projects produced enough value to convince holdouts to embrace working with analytics. Adoption also increased as frontline employees worked with specialists to create the tools and as managers recognized employees’ success using them. Preparing for analytics, well ahead of its time Tata Steel’s multiyear effort to develop analytics capabilities at the Kalinganagar plant can be traced to a decision that executives made in 2005, when the plant was first being designed and built. Analytics technologies were then years away from becoming readily applicable to businesses. Nevertheless, Tata Steel’s executives considered whether they should outfit the plant with instruments and sensors to monitor equipment and processes. Their decision was less clear-cut than it would have been today—remote-sensing equipment is now affordable and advanced analytics has been broadly adopted . But some executives and managers foresaw that spending money on data-collection gear would prove worthwhile, even though it wasn’t yet clear how the data would be used. Amit Kumar Chatterjee, the plant’s then-head of electrical maintenance, was among those pushing to make the early investment—and even he acknowledged that at the time, the potential applications for advanced analytics were undefined. “We didn’t have in mind how we’d use the data, except maybe for autonomous process controls. We were living in the world of physical science, where experience and equations matter most. Data science was not even on the horizon,” said Chatterjee. Even the makers of the plant’s machinery resisted adding instrumentation. “Still, we believed we should put on the sensors at that stage because we felt it would be a lot harder later on, when the uses for the data were known.” By the mid-2010s, the leaders of the Kalinganagar plant began looking closely at what they could do with the data the plant’s sensors were collecting. In 2015, T. V. Narendran, the managing director of Tata Steel, set out a $1 billion cost-optimization goal and called on the heads of the company’s plants to map a path toward that goal. One way of boosting performance, he suggested, was to do more with digital technology. Advances in hardware and data science had made it easier for companies to take big data sets, uncover patterns, and make predictions that could help them attain performance improvements. Leaders at Kalinganagar launched their own investigation into how the plant might apply data science. In 2016, they traveled to Germany and visited technology start-ups and large established companies to get a close look at what data science could do. Early the following year, the plant’s leaders resolved to start an advanced-analytics program at Kalinganagar. Beginning the analytics transformation Senior managers at Kalinganagar decided to try advanced analytics on several pilot projects. During a two-day workshop, managers and operations specialists worked with McKinsey experts to identify ten possible uses for analytics and selected three to focus on—one of which involved the superheating process in the plant’s secondary-metallurgy station. Managers wanted to create an advanced-analytics model that could assess conditions in the plant and calculate how much heat to apply during superheating so that the steel would emerge in the target temperature range. The team working on the superheating model sought to discern which variables were the most important determinants of the steel’s final temperature, and thereby learn how operators could improve the strike rate. They pulled together two years’ worth of operational data that had been generated by sensors or recorded manually in logbooks. Data scientists wrote algorithms to make connections among key factors: measures of the condition of the steel as it reached the secondary-metallurgy station, equipment settings that operators would adjust during the superheating cycle, and other settings that couldn’t be adjusted during a cycle but could be altered over time (such as the maximum rate of oxygen flow, capped by the equipment already in place). Preliminary results from several pilot projects convinced leaders at Tata Steel Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort. They laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve critical performance indicators and believed that analytics could help. After two weeks, the team had built a model capable of predicting, with 75 percent accuracy, whether a group of set-point recommendations would cause the molten steel to reach the casting station in the desired temperature range. The other two pilot-project teams built models of similar reliability. Although none of the models had yet been put to the test on the plant floor, the preliminary results convinced leaders at Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort and create models that employees would actually use. In September 2017, leaders laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve the plant’s critical performance indicators—energy consumption, throughput, quality, and yield—and believed that analytics could help . They chose to carry over the work on the superheating model to the first full phase of the project. Together, the five areas had the potential to enhance margins by $10 million annually. Ramping up As operations teams and analytics specialists built the phase-one models, leaders at Kalinganagar sponsored an effort to begin training some 130 employees—which comprised one-quarter of the managerial staff—in analytics. With McKinsey, the plant set up an introductory analytics academy , installed a 15-member faculty, and created 50-hour curricula for five roles: digital champion, project owner, business translator, data scientist, and data engineer. Students performed simple practice exercises in line with the duties dictated by their roles. Although the models from the first phase worked well for a time, they started to falter as conditions in the plant deviated from the conditions that the models had been optimized for. The employees who had been through the academy tried to fix the models but could not do so using the basic techniques they’d learned by that point. And they had yet to work as apprentices on analytics projects, which would have given them hands-on experience retraining models. They simply needed more real-world exposure to analytics. Challenges also arose as frontline operators tried to start working with the models. Shailendra Rai, the chief of blast-furnace operations at Kalinganagar, recalled that operators never became comfortable with a model that had been created to help improve the stability of the blast furnace: “Most people spend 20 or 30 years learning how to operate a blast furnace. They thought that the model would be this magical solution. When the initial output from the model didn’t match their beliefs, they couldn’t understand why. They weren’t convinced it would work. The buy-in wasn’t there.” Supporting an analytics transformation: A leader’s view by Rajiv Kumar After the first phase of the analytics transformation at Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, I saw that managers needed to put more emphasis on developing the capabilities of the plant’s workforce. I also recognized that I should make the transformation a top priority. This kind of transformation succeeds when everyone buys in—and for buy-in to develop, leaders must show they’ve bought in, too. To signal the transformation’s importance, I announced that Kalinganagar wouldn’t undertake any other big initiatives until the plant had developed the capabilities to build and deploy analytics solutions on its own. Consistency and stability are important in steelmaking, so changing the way we do things can be hard. I knew that if everyone’s attention was divided between multiple change initiatives, the analytics transformation would be more likely to slow down or stall out. I also began holding “skip-level meetings” with junior members of our workforce who were being trained as analytics specialists or learning to use analytics in frontline jobs. The analytics work wasn’t easy, so I wanted to hear firsthand about it, just as I do when I walk around the plant and talk to equipment operators and technicians. Having a feel for how things are going on the plant floor is important. Then, in the second phase of the transformation, I required managers from the plant to give updates on the analytics projects they were working on. All my questions went to Tata Steel employees as well. It was another way to reinforce the idea that analytics is part of how our plant now operates. Rajiv Kumar is vice president of operations for Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Doubling down on capabilities The model-building exercise confirmed what leaders at Kalinganagar had expected: that analytics could deliver significant and valuable performance improvements. It also convinced leaders to make further investments in employees’ capabilities so they could sustain the performance improvements and take analytics into other areas . In mid-2018, leaders chose to initiate a second phase of the program in which analytics specialists and frontline operators would develop and implement models to aid their decisions and receive hands-on training in analytics, with McKinsey’s help. For the team building the superheating model, analytics specialists from Tata Steel took a refresher course in the skills they’d studied at the academy. Then they were assigned to perform certain development tasks—augmenting the user interface, simplifying the database, retraining the model, deploying new modeling techniques and approaches—in collaboration with experienced practitioners from McKinsey. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists were assigned to perform development tasks in collaboration with experienced practitioners. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists also spent extra time working with the employees who controlled the superheating process at the secondary-metallurgy station. They asked more questions about the process to fine-tune the model. Specialists watched the operators at work and talked with them about ways of making the model easier to use. Operators cited numerous difficulties, from faulty computer hardware to clunky user interfaces, that the analytics team helped resolve. The analytics team explained how they had developed the model and how it worked, because they wanted operators to trust its recommendations. “All the employees at Kalinganagar had been trained to make decisions based on their experience. When problems happened, they would try to solve them with physical equations—put in raw materials and heat, get a certain output. They do look at data. But with data science, they can connect many more data points than we can with physical science. Even if they don’t have a physical equation to explain why something is happening, they can still figure it out with data. That was a new belief system that had to be built up,” said Chatterjee. After around six months, the superheating squad had built a model capable of recommending process set points that would raise the superheating strike rate to 90 percent. Now it was time for frontline operators to begin using the model on a regular basis. Managers kept track of who used the model and who didn’t and celebrated the accomplishments of the most devoted users. Employees went from following 60 percent of the model’s recommendations to following 85 percent in a couple of months. Taking analytics to scale When the second phase concluded, the plant’s leadership raised the bar once more. They called for a third phase, in which Tata Steel employees would select, lead, and deliver analytics projects related to each of the plant’s main areas: core processes, power, and utilities. McKinsey consultants would move into coaching roles on the employee-led project teams. To focus their efforts, these teams set improvement goals for more than 25 performance indicators, such as the daily tonnage of pig iron produced by the plant’s blast furnace. Because several of those indicators pertained to the superheating process, it again emerged as a priority for analytics work. The plant’s analytics specialists had learned enough about data science by then to take charge of the superheating model. They narrowed its target temperature range. They also added the ability to predict how much cooling would take place between the secondary-metallurgy station and the casting station. This helped operators manage the transfer better and increase throughput. Frontline operators followed the model’s recommendations even more closely. As a result, the superheating model produced the annual cost savings of $4 million that had been estimated at the outset of the analytics program. Comparable gains accrued elsewhere in the plant. For each of the 25-plus performance indicators, teams realized at least 80 percent of the targeted improvements. Their efforts yielded $70 million to $80 million of value and two to three percentage points of EBITDA 1 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. uplift. And in July 2019, the World Economic Forum announced that an independent panel of experts in the Fourth Industrial Revolution had recognized the Kalinganagar plant’s digital achievements as leading edge and named it a Lighthouse facility —making it the first such plant in India. Looking ahead The Kalinganagar plant now has a cohort of more than 30 analytics specialists, including data scientists and translators. The most experienced have become in-house instructors and coaches and are responsible for helping other colleagues learn new skills in data science, business-case development, and other key domains. With analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support. Analytics knowledge has also suffused the plant’s day-to-day work, changing the way that many employees solve problems. As Shailendra Rai, the head of blast-furnace operations, said, “If you talk to five blast furnace operators, they will have five different opinions about how to solve a problem. In a way, all five are correct—everyone’s speaking based on their own experience. But with analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support.” With these capabilities, managers have drawn up a slate of more than 20 additional use cases, and they are reinforcing the use of analytics where it’s already in place. For Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, analytics has become more than a tool for answering questions—it’s an integral part of the plant’s operations and culture.

When the 36th edition began in early March, the race’s defending champion, Emirates Team New Zealand, hit the water having utilized a new crewmember: an AI bot created by McKinsey. It turned out to be a winning combination. On March 17, the Kiwis successfully defended their title against the Italian challengers, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, winning their fourth America’s Cup. The America’s Cup has always been as much about technology and innovation as it is about sailing. Boat designs are governed by the competition’s “ Class Rule , ” which leaves small opportunities for design tweaks that might give one team an advantage over another. If brilliantly seized, those opportunities can translate into a shining race-day performance. Our goal was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. The Class Rule for this year’s race, published in March 2018, required the two competing teams to sail a 75-foot vessel. It’s not your typical sailboat. Hydrofoils fixed to the hull lift the entire craft out of the water, enabling it to reach speeds exceeding 60 mph, or 100 kph. Most importantly, the hydrofoils are one part of the boat where the Class Rule allowed for design modifications, which offered huge competitive advantages for the teams that got those modifications right. Doing so, according to McKinsey senior partner Brian Fox, required intensive testing—and lots of it. “Every boat in the America’s Cup is designed with a computer simulator,” says Brian, who sails competitively. “Whichever team has the best simulator, and uses it most effectively, gains the advantage.” In 2019, Emirates Team New Zealand partnered with McKinsey to begin an innovative project seeking that advantage. What they needed, they soon realized, was a new kind of crew member that could sail thousands of boats at a time. The answer to that call was an AI bot, or software robot, that could test new hydrofoil designs by sailing them on Emirates Team New Zealand’s simulator. Creating value beyond the hype The simulator had been key to the team’s victory in 2017; the sailors had used it to test new boat designs without having to actually build them. But that simulator required multiple team members using it simultaneously for it to work properly. This was a logistical challenge, given the sailors’ scheduled practices, travel, and competitions. “Our goal,” Brian explains, “was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. By developing an AI bot that could run the simulator by itself, we no longer had to manage around the sailors’ limited availability.” As a first step, the McKinsey team, which included colleagues from our analytics firm QuantumBlack , turned to the cloud. Over six-weeks, data, analytics, and machine-learning experts from Sydney, Melbourne, and London migrated New Zealand’s simulator and developed an infrastructure to run it in the cloud. Then our team used a new and innovative approach called deep reinforcement learning to essentially teach the AI bot how to become a professional sailor. The technique allowed the bot to learn dynamically and gain greater accuracy through continuous feedback. Nic Hohn , one of the key project leaders, explains. “When you start, the AI agent knows nothing and learns by trial and error using countless variables—wind speed, direction, adjustments to the 14 different sail and boat controls—and is refined again and again,” Nic says. “Since the bot keeps experimenting, if you coach it to learn in the right way, it compresses into hours what would take a human years to understand.” This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat. The work was highly technical, according to QuantumBlack’s chief scientist Jacomo Corbo, and it required  extensive innovation around the bot’s learning program. “At this point in the project, a lot of creative thinking had to be done to figure out the right learning models, how best to coach the bot, and the right guard rails and rewards to put into place.” The team also created a network that allowed multiple bots to share information as they each learned to sail. This was a critical breakthrough, as it allowed the individual bots to gain knowledge from their collective experience. Ultimately, there were a thousand bots running in parallel, learning from each other. “It's learning at a huge scale and it dramatically reduces the time and cost of the project,” says Nic. “That's the power of the cloud.” Within two weeks, the bot was sailing in a straight line, upwind and downwind. After mastering the basics, it graduated to more complex sailing maneuvers. The turning point came about eight weeks later, when the AI bot started beating the sailors in the simulator. At this point, the bot became the ideal way to test variations of the hydrofoils; it was more consistent and more scalable than the sailors, speeding the cycles of design iterations dramatically. “This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat,” observes Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and member of the QuantumBlack leadership team in Europe, who is also a world champion sailor. Soon, the sailors were learning maneuvers from the bot. “With such a steep development curve, accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable,” explains Oliver Fleming , an expert associate partner, “both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, the bot sped New Zealand’s design process by a factor of ten. The race’s outcome proves that reinforcement learning can be a transformational tool for process design, with potential applications across industries. “This has been one of the most complex deployments of deep reinforcement learning in the public cloud,” says Jacomo. “One way to think about the difficulty of the problem: game-tree complexity roughly tallies the size of the space one has to navigate while accounting for the set of possible game paths, or the sequence of decisions, that need to be taken. Go , which is an extremely complex board game, has a game-tree complexity of 170—our sailing problem has a game-tree complexity of nearly 2900.” Mastering such technical complexity, particularly in this application, has heightened this project’s excitement for everyone involved. “It is thrilling to be using technology and AI to master the wind and water and go as fast as you possibly can,” says Nic. “This is not sailing as we know it—it's much closer to flying a low-altitude aircraft.” To learn more about our work in AI, visit QuantumBlack .

Built by Facebook with help from Google, the cables could boost data capacity to southeast Asia’s largest economy by 70 percent. The project, which is still subject to government approval, would be a boon to Indonesia’s connected users, who are among the savviest in the region and beyond. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Today, the nation comprises the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in the world. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Telkomsel has been an engine of that growth. The world’s seventh-largest mobile operator and the largest in Southeast Asia, the mobile-communications provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable, inclusive digital economy for Indonesia’s nearly 200 million internet users. It has dramatically increased Indonesia’s broadband access, helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) digitize, and led the nation’s transition from 3G to 4G before becoming the first operator to launch 5G there in May 2021. Telkomsel has long recognized the value of continuous innovation. When it looked to ensure its platform would remain the primary way its customers engage with the world—and win a new generation of customers—the 26-year-old incumbent decided to embark on a big, bold transformation. A plan to transform The move wouldn’t be easy, but Telkomsel felt it had an obligation to its customers, who had come to rely on the provider’s ability to meet their digital demands. So the organization called on a cross-functional team of data-domain experts from QuantumBlack and venture builders, designers, and strategy consultants from Leap by McKinsey to initiate a large-scale digital program aimed at reinventing the way customers experience Telkomsel in daily life. As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel knew it had to engage and strengthen its relevance with Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer segment. The average data-hungry Gen Z consumer in Indonesia spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone, using it to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. The program was built on three core pillars. Telkomsel wanted to build a new data analytics platform to better understand its customers and drive personalization; create and launch new businesses to reach underserved consumers; and launch a new digital channel that would streamline and simplify the way customers engage with Telkomsel’s services. Understanding customers Telkomsel’s leaders knew that providing customers with the best products and services would require putting data to smart use. The company developed new analytics capabilities that allowed it to enhance customers’ experiences and start the journey toward hyper-personalizing its services. Telkomsel began by building a new platform that contains more than 9,000 data points for each consumer, which was fully modular and reusable across business units. This gave the company a single, near-real-time view of customer behavior that could be used to improve experience across the entire consumer journey, from marketing and customer service to network operations, back-office support, and more. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. They also moved from manual data uploads to automated data pipelines and quality checks, which improved data quality and speed, and enabled more accurate and faster decision-making. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. Every month, Telkomsel runs more than 50 analytical models, based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, to identify the right way to interact with their customers and offer them propositions that are most relevant to them. The move toward hyper-personalization has allowed Telkomsel to better tailor their offers for customers. Today, these services and offerings already account for 50 percent of the telco’s overall revenues. Creating value beyond the hype Launching new businesses As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel moved to engage and strengthen its relevance with new consumer segments. For instance, the company needed to enhance its relevance to those underserved by traditional home broadband infrastructure. They also wanted to reach Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer audience, which spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. In order to move at their desired speed, Telkomsel would need to launch new brands and value propositions, which would require them to embrace a different culture, agile ways of working, and a fit-for-purpose technological stack through new business-building. In the end, they launched two new brands. Orbit: Expanding connectivity for underserved segments Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. Even as Indonesia rapidly digitized, fixed broadband access was not uniform, with just 15 percent of households using it to get online. To provide wireless connectivity to those who lacked fixed broadband, Telkomsel built and launched a new business called Orbit, which provides customers with a home router that uses 4G mobile cellular services instead of fiber optics. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. It includes a mobile app to check usage, top up on data, and manage router settings, such as parental controls. Orbit has doubled its one-year customer acquisition goal, with more than 35 percent of customers joining from its referral program, a testament to its popularity and market demand. Today, Orbit is seeing 20 percent month-over-month growth. By.U: Reaching Generation Z Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. Telkomsel didn’t have the kind of brand association among the digital natives it wanted to serve and delight. A cross-functional team of product managers, customer design experts and venture builders developed, built, and launched by.U, an all-digital telco experience. The platform allows users to select a pre-paid SIM card that arrives at their doorstep, activate their number remotely, manage top-ups and quotas, make payments, and more. By.U was built at pace. The team created a series of social-media tests to observe click-through rates on certain features, which allowed the team to develop and tune the minimum-viable product quickly. When Telkomsel beta-launched the brand, they quickly had 30,000 customers join the waitlist. The brand reached its one-year customer acquisition goal in half that time. Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. And to help ensure innovation continued post-launch, the by.U team established an agile-organization structure. Simplifying and enhancing engagement The app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. The goal of Telkomsel’s third pillar could be simply stated: to make customers’ interactions with the company as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible. But it was complicated to achieve. Telkomsel already had a self-serve mobile app, and the team initially set out to make changes there to improve the customer journey. However, as customer expectations for what an app could do rose—digital payments and loyalty programs, for example—so did pressure on the app’s infrastructure. It soon became clear that there was more value to be had in starting fresh. Delivering a new app is always complex. In this case, a core technology transition to a micro-services-based architecture proved to be the unlock. It also meant shaping a rigorous product-development strategy and creating a new commercial strategy to encourage uptake. But it was all worth it. With the launch of the award-winning MyTelkomsel, the company was able to offer customers more transparency around their usage, going from SMS-triggered alerts to an immediate, real-time view, as well as provide personalized packages tailored to their needs. Customer experience around digital payments became seamless, while an ecosystem with digital-retail partners let Telkomsel customers redeem loyalty points for products. Elsewhere, gamification mechanics allowed customers to earn badges that qualified them for free data allowances. The app also enabled access to new digital services, including video and gaming, and easier access to e-payment options through services like LinkAja, GoPay, OVO, Dana, and ShopeePay. All of this meant serving customers in more dynamic, exciting, and tailored ways. Today the app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. All aboard: Recruiting digital talent to sustain innovation Telkomsel knew that technology was only one part of the transformation equation. Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform—no matter how powerful—would perform to potential or withstand technological evolution. They also saw the potential in this partnership to help cultivate digital skills in Indonesia’s workforce, strengthening a commitment to building a center of excellence for Indonesian digital talent. They launched a new, agile recruitment process to attract, onboard, and train 40+ of Indonesia’s strong digital talent across data science, software engineering, product ownership and UX design. This entailed a whole new talent management approach – reinventing employer branding, carving out career paths for new profiles like data engineers and translators, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling existing analytics professionals. Over the course of several months, Telkomsel hired candidates across 12 newly created digital and data analytics roles, and set up seven cross-functional agile squads to catalyze the adoption of new ways of working. The end-product was a data management platform and new businesses - made in Indonesia, for Indonesians, by Indonesians. Culture, capabilities, and resilience Inside the company, its most enduring returns may also be among its least tangible: An emerging culture of innovation and agility; new capabilities and competencies; a new confidence in taking bold leaps through new ventures; and a commitment to long-term, sustainable transformation. Such traits, for example, enabled Telkomsel to help its customers through COVID-19. They quickly ensured their customers had fully-remote, digital services at their fingertips, and they were able to offer new packages that were tailored to what their customers needed and could afford at any given time. The telco industry is essential to our modern economies, enabling nearly every facet of remote connectivity, from online meetings to e-commerce to telehealth. It’s a sector in which it can feel like there’s little room for failure—and perhaps not always enough room for innovation. Telkomsel’s story is proof that innovation is not just valuable but critical; and that it can pay off when an organization commits to transformation at every level. Its digital journey has touched the lives of hundreds of millions of Indonesians, through personalization at-scale to enhance the experience of all its customers, new brands tailored to its digital-first users, and a new app that adds convenience to customers’ daily lives.

Welders spend long hours on their feet and often work outside: on bridges, at race tracks, in oil fields, and other sites. Welding strains eyesight, the neck, and shoulders. Fumes are toxic and burns common. For 40 years, our Sweden-based design team has collaborated first with Speedglas and then with 3M to design, and continually improve, welding helmets. With every product cycle, the joint team started from scratch, reimagining and redesigning the helmets, with innovations that sometimes shifted the entire industry. Our partnership has helped to improve welders’ safety and comfort under dangerous and strenuous working conditions. It started in 1983 when a tiny company called Speedglas invented a new type of welding glass. It darkened automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc, freeing welders from having to constantly “nod” the shield up and down as they worked. Other innovations over the years included a device that pivots the shield up and back over the crown of the head, rather than resting at the forehead, easing neck pain. Internal padding that skirted pressure points, reducing headaches. A two-way fan system that improved breathability. A textile covering that captured stray glass crystals. A curved design for glass that extended peripheral vision. Our partnership has produced seven signature helmet designs, with accessories, which have won 11 international awards, including a 2021 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award , and are now sold in 60+ countries. But most importantly, our work together has helped to protect welders around the world . Our North Star How do you sustain a 40-year partnership and reinvent the same product in fresh, new ways, again and again? “From our first contact in the mid-80s, we realized that if we worked together we could do something exceptional for our end users: the welders,” reflects Anders Grönberg , the global portfolio leader of welding at 3M. An engineer and market economist by training, Anders has led the development of the helmets for 25+ years, since joining Speedglas in 1990, and then moving on to 3M when it bought the company in 2004. “This has been our common interest during all these years: That we fulfill their needs today and in the future. The fact that we have been successful has, of course, also strengthened the relationship.” When Speedglas was first invented, industries in Sweden were advanced when it came to personal protective equipment. “Organizations were very keen to take care of their users,” recalls Anders. “We got a lot of suggestions and improvements from welders. We took notes with paper and pen and would go back to the office, share the information, and it would grow from there.” “Our North Star has always been to do the research where the welders are most comfortable: at his or her welding bench,” explains Oskar Juhlin , a McKinsey Design alumnus who led the helmet design work from 1983 to 2019. “If you bring someone into a design workshop, office, or other synthetic area, they won’t be as straightforward as they would be in their own environment. We also welded in our own studios, so we could test out the designs ourselves .” Design matters We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design. Early on, it was a challenge to talk to welders about design; at the time it was typically understood to be a field concerned with aesthetics alone. “One guy told me ‘I don’t care about how it looks, as long as I like it,’” he remembers. “Many welders work on race cars. Well it was a different story when I said, ‘So it doesn’t matter what wheels you put on your car?’ Yes, it does! So, then design is important? We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design.” Over time, the customer base grew to include countries in Asia and the US, where customers were very interested in the helmet technologies and had ideas for improvements. “There were more regulatory requirements to fulfil, so user research expanded into a more formal system,” recalls Anders. “We also realized we had to look beyond the current moment and anticipate the welders’ future needs.” Today, a product road map guides the design planning from three to five years out, with the goal of introducing a new helmet model every two years. “The cycles are getting shorter as the technology is changing more quickly,” says Anders. How we work The typical product cycle begins with the R&D team at 3M presenting the newest technical capabilities to three our four McKinsey industrial designers.  Many have worked together for years. The designers will have a wish list of what they’d like it to look like, as well as new materials, textiles, and fabrics to consider. “You design the helmet with several design concepts, on paper, in computer, foam and clay models, exploring different shapes and trying out materials,” explains Emelie Hedén Edlund , a design director who specializes in color, materials, and finish —or CMF, as it’s known— and worked on the later models. “You touch it, feel it, and then you go back to the computer again. There is a lot of back-and-forth between digital and physical hands-on testing.” The design studio is located in a large converted missionary church in Stockholm, with workshops for sewing, foam and wood working, metal working, and welding. As the design phase unfolds, the joint teams meet in a series of workshops, sitting together for one or two days testing out new prototypes, splitting up to work separately and do homework, and then coming back together to validate new iterations. Then they go to the welders to try out the prototypes and confirm they are moving in the right direction. If so, they go on to the next stage: the critical step of ensuring that the helmet model can be manufactured in high volumes . Hans Nyström , associate design director at McKinsey, recalls one inspiring meeting. “The extended 3M team and our designers were at the table, discussing a very complicated prototype. And it was clear that it weighed too much. No one wanted to raise their hand and say ‘it’s my work that’s causing this.’”  On the spur of the moment, the McKinsey team proposed a workshop: to get tools and drills out, then and there, and find ways to cut the weight. Together the entire team looked at every component—drill a hole here, nip away material there. They lost ounces. “From that experience, we all saw a better way of working. By sharing the common goal, it changed the whole mindset of the team,” Emelie said. “It doesn’t feel like a client relationship, but like a partnership.” “It feels good to work with a partner who has so much trust,” says Hans. “3M has an appreciation of good design—we share that as a starting point. We complement each other skill-wise. They have the deep technical and mechanical expertise while we focus on the design and exterior surfaces. We are on the same software systems, so it’s a seamless integrated workflow. Together we share a wealth of knowledge.” Giving emotional resonance to a functional object Over the years, our designers have drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources including medieval knights, superheroes, ergonomics, and Chinese acupressure. But for many, the helmet model closest to their hearts is the 9000 launched in 1996. It was the first time user research had been incorporated into every step, and it was a major departure in design. The shape of the helmet morphed from a square mailbox into a mask that felt more like a natural extension of the wearer’s face. “The design team had a lot of discussions with the welders about the emotional aspects or character we wanted to express,” explains Hans. “It had to be very professional, powerful. Welders are very proud of their work–just think of the image of Rosie the Riveter, who was a welder. This was the heritage of the profession. If it were in a movie, the helmet would have to be fit for a hero knight on a black dragon.” Designers introduced a ridge down the middle of the helmet face to suggest the look of armor and expressed trust through open forehead lines and other facial nuances. The ‘line of sight’ is angled downward, focused on the hands—the work. This model also incorporated the ability to exhale through side vents. “At the time, they were actually put on mannequins in the windows of one of Stockholm’s finest department stores as a fashion item because they looked so cool,” recalls Emelie. “They went from being a very functional object to having an emotional element.” The helmet would be cited as an example of ‘futuristic’ design for the next ten years. After it was launched in 1996, the strikingly futuristic 3M Speedglas 9000 helmet was displayed on mannequins in the department store Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm. Breathing easier Three years later, the team introduced the Speedglas Adflo, an air-purifying respirator that circulated air to reduce heat and improve breathability. It was a fan attachment that fit snugly down the welder’s body, fastened with a belt at the waist. This tight profile reduced the risk of the welder getting snagged on the equipment. “It was a revolutionary change,” said Oskar. “All of the other fans on the market had a round filter attached to the back which looked like a mushroom. By 2014, we went to a trade show, and every fan on market had this tight, streamlined look—our design had moved the market.” Last year, 3M launched the G5-02 for highly precise TIG welding. The helmet holds the world’s first curved glass shield, a design that follows the shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This year, it won the Red Dot award with a Best of the Best distinction. Looking ahead, Oskar predicts: “The helmets will become almost like a second skin, with softer, high-tech materials rather than hard plastic which is bulky, uncomfortable, noisy. Shields are already connected to blue tooth so you can maneuver equipment with a phone; there will be developments with cameras and video, and radar may be used for detecting the target, rather than light.” The evening news While the awards and external praise are gratifying, some of the most satisfying recognition has come from welders themselves. “We have had many, many stories, but there are a couple that are more famous within 3M,” Anders says. “We had a welder here in Sweden who we were visiting at his work site. We had just introduced the respiratory protection together with the helmet. After a moment’s thought, he said that he liked the helmet now because he could actually watch the late news on television. Before he began using the respirator, he was so tired that he would fall asleep before the news had started. That was an indication to us that the product that we had supplied to the market was actually helping to improve our users’ quality of life. It is a huge motivation for all of the people in our company to continue working with this kind of product.” For Oskar, the ultimate recognition came with the futuristic 9100 series. “Some welders tattooed themselves with images of that shield,” says Oskar. “That says something about our design.” Related Practices Design | Operations | Technology Related Articles How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger How award-winning design is helping older adults live safely and with dignity at home", "summary": "For 40 years, 3M and Speedglas have collaborated to design innovative welding helmets, enhancing safety and comfort for welders.

There appeared to be no solution. The complexity of the devices, whose supply chains comprise hundreds of specialized manufacturers scattered across the globe, made production surges seemingly impossible. “Italy wanted to order 4,000,” a European manufacturer told the paper, “but there’s not a chance.” Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, an effort was underway that would unite a group of optimists and problem solvers from Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, McKinsey, and an array of Vyaire’s suppliers. Together, they embarked on an ambitious quest to dramatically increase ventilator production, thereby giving medical professionals a chance to better care for critically ill patients. Before it was all said and done, the venture would put thousands of furloughed people back to work, stand up a new ventilator-manufacturing facility, and bolster links in far-flung supply chains on the way to hitting a production rate that would deliver nearly a years’ worth of ventilators every three days . “At Vyaire, we take pride in accepting and facing challenges that others might shy away from,” says Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal. “In this case, we achieved something others might not dare to imagine.” Beyond business as usual The history of mechanical ventilation goes back hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until the polio epidemics of the early 20th century that the devices were widely used. Among the most well-known was the Drinker respirator, or “iron lung,” which looked like a mini submarine and was powered by vacuum-cleaner motors. They’ve come a long way since then. Today, these devices are the size of a large briefcase and utilize multiple circuit boards, complex software, and hundreds of components to control things like air pressure, flow rate, oxygen level, humidity, and temperature. Their engineering has more in common with aerospace systems than with household appliances. Ventilators are much scarcer than either of those things, however, and the outbreak of COVID-19 introduced a vast and widening gulf between supply and demand. In April of 2020, for instance, a McKinsey team looking at global medical supplies estimated that there were about 23 ventilators per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the most plentiful supply. “In Africa,” says Miyu Toyoshima Galliart, a McKinsey associate partner, “the region with the lowest supply according to the analysis, the estimate was fewer than one [ventilator] per 100,000 people.” Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth “To call this extraordinary-demand scenario ‘unprecedented’ would be a gross understatement,” says McKinsey partner Ron Ritter, who helped lead the effort. “Nothing about ventilators—their supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, service, or support—was ever designed for anything like what happened with COVID-19.” Typical ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day. Vyaire’s production team suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Of course, Vyaire’s operations were built for typical demand—not the increased needs of a pandemic. Its usual ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day, which is a lot considering the complexity, quality-control requirements, and capital-asset value. (By comparison, the highest-demand commercial aircraft in modern history never once exceeded a production rate of 60 per month. While different in many ways, both are highly engineered capital assets.) In April of 2020, Vyaire’s main ventilator product line suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Making that number would require a ramp in production toward 700 units a day in a matter of weeks. “Our executive team heard the concern in the voices of colleagues in the field, who were speaking with clinicians and providers across the world,” says Tammy Noll, senior vice president and general manager of Vyaire’s ventilation franchise. “We knew immediately no amount of business-as-usual was going to work.” So, the company got to work on business-as- unusual . The first step was to maximize output at Vyaire’s Palm Springs, California plant. Joined by industrial engineers from a major auto manufacturer in North America, Vyaire and McKinsey teams worked to revalidate basic manufacturing numbers, dial-in labor, and machinery capacity. Stopwatches and toolboxes in hand, these experts did everything they could—timed process cycles, analyzed bottlenecks, reviewed floor layouts, tweaked machines, and more—to get the most out of the capacity they had at hand. “We started with a spreadsheet,” says Bhavuk Tandon, a McKinsey associate and member of the team walking the factory floor, “and we were conducting time studies on the floor, going through every cell, understanding all the lines and how they worked. We needed that information to help us understand what we had to do to build a facility that [would] give 30 times and more—fast.” Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations. The practice, Ron says, can be an effective first step during critical shortages. “Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations,” he explains. “Finding it normally produces a 20 to 30 percent boost in output right away.” Once the analysis was complete, Vyaire added shifts to the reoptimized line. The moves helped increase production by about threefold. It was a huge leap by industry standards, but well short of what it would take to begin meeting demand. To get there, the company would need to make an even bigger move—to the American heartland. An interview with Vyaire Medical CEO Gaurav Agarwal A new workforce, a new building With its Palm Springs plant running as hard as it could—yet still falling behind demand—Vyaire leaders began working hard to find more workers. “This was about finding an entire second workforce,” says David Marchand, now a McKinsey alum, who helped lead the project. “In a single product line, we needed an estimated 800 people: front-line operators, supervisors, process engineers, maintenance techs, security guards, department leads, site executives, warehouse staff, shipping departments, buyers—and they needed to know how to perform extremely well together, right away.” When needed immediately, a workforce like that can’t be hired incrementally. The only way to acquire one was to locate an intact team—which came from Spirit AeroSystems. The aerospace and medical-device industries may seem like strange bedfellows, but Spirit was the right partner for several reasons. Operationally, their people know industrialization, have high production standards, and operate complex supply chains. And in this case, given COVID-19’s impact on air travel, the company had people who were furloughed and more than ready to get back to work. We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world. This was clearly an international-security-level situation. But beyond that, it was Spirit’s culture that made them the perfect fit. According to Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile, “Spirit cultivates a ‘can be done,’ mission-oriented culture that has been built on accepting challenges.” This challenge tapped the company’s core values of transparency, collaboration, and inspiration, and it inspired the combined workforce of over 1000 employees. “We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world,” says Tom. “This was clearly an international-security-level situation.” To get the most out of this workforce, Vyaire looked beyond California in search of more production capacity. They found it 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, where Vyaire decided to open an additional ventilator plant. That may be easy to imagine, but it was hard to execute. Beyond a suitable 55,000 square-foot building, it took machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, quality control, assembly, testing facilities, and much more. Capacities for each manufacturing-process step had to be calculated. Several miles of copper, medical-grade oxygen gas-flow lines, electrical drops, and industrial-grade air compressors had to be installed. Data connectivity to handle huge test-protocol transactions with cloud-based legacy software needed to be set. Workstations, production tooling, and a range of fixtures had to be built or sourced and calibrated. Even basics like car parking for 200-person shifts, break rooms, badging, security, and fire-control had to be installed. Most critically, Vyaire and Spirit had to design and build workforce COVID-19 safety, including social-distancing fixtures, temperature screening, reporting, and testing protocols. “We were hyper focused on providing a safe environment for every single person who was about to work in that building,” says Noll. “We also knew the risk of outbreak in this facility carried added weight. Not only were we concerned about their health and that of their families, but we were also cognizant that the consequences of illness there would be felt by patients in need of these devices across the globe.” Vyaire and Spirit were now ready to chase a benchmark that, months prior, would’ve only existed in a company’s wildest dreams. All they needed now were enough parts to make it a reality. Supply-chain reaction Supply-chain operations make and deliver tangible aspects of our lives and create the fundamental material pathways in a functioning society. Unappreciated in normal times, they rush to the forefront in times of crisis, such as the great wars and most recently, COVID-19. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. During COVID-19, these suppliers were just as pressed as Vyaire. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. Much of their supply-chain expense sits among fasteners, precision-machined valves, resin-molded components, electronic circuits, batteries, and more. During COVID-19, the plants that manufacture these components were just as pressed as Vyaire. Versions of the same efficiency processes happening in Palm Springs and Wichita unfolded in hundreds of operations across the ventilator supply chain. The effectiveness of these moves was critical to boosting output, but they were harder for Vyaire to control. The suppliers medical-device manufacturers use were scattered globally. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they were often hit by competing demands. For example, an electronics manufacturer that makes medical-device circuit boards could see a wave of demand for virtual-work devices. Suppliers did their best to respond. Many found ways to ramp-up quickly and help get Vyaire and Spirit what they needed. Others lost adjacent demand and had capacity to spare. But in some cases, suppliers lost capacity or had exceedingly long lead times. The most critical of these situations—the ones whose projected output would limit the team’s target rate—were placed on a “red list.” Early on, the red list was long. “It was apparent that dozens of material sources might hold us back,” says Jenna Stauffer, a McKinsey engagement manager who worked on supply chains in the effort. Clearing the red list would require advanced intervention. A group comprising Vyaire’s most experienced buyers and manufacturing experts worked directly with suppliers to get specific information on process flows, bottleneck constraints, shipping delays, and the company’s own component constraints. In most cases, these interventions worked. But in extreme cases, teams cleared to travel during COVID-19 lockdown conditions worked directly with vendors on site. In one example, a European producer of pressure transducers emerged as a key constraint. Teams traveled to the plant, mapped the entire process flow, and installed IoT sensors on a key rate-determining step in a single day. The work provided live, digital tracking of actual production against the max potential rate, and it helped the site raise its output within 48 hours. The red list work was among the most relentless of the entire effort. It went on around the clock daily, as time zones rolled through the global night, demanding nonstop problem solving for months. The impossible made possible—by people If machines and technology were this effort’s arms and legs, people—many of whom have never met in person to this day—were its head and heart. They were united through a relentless drive to help, a product of the cultures at both Vyaire and Spirit, and they had the skills necessary to do so. “Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring,” says Catherine-Sophie Haigh, a McKinsey operations specialist who worked on the project. “Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity, and they trusted the teammate by their side—in many cases by their ‘virtual’ side.” Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring. Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity. This was especially evident around one of the initiative’s most critical moments. When it became clear that the Palm Springs plant would never have the capacity to hit rising target rates, and splitting focus between it and the Wichita plant was sapping energy, leaders decided to execute what became known as “lift and shift” to consolidate the entire operation under a single roof. This meant shutting down the key ventilator production lines in the California plant over a weekend, crating all production equipment, and moving it as quickly and safely as possible to Kansas. Given the stakes, the risk of losing equipment in transit, having it not restart, or suffering irreparable damage was frightening. “I’d done something like this on a smaller scale before,” says McKinsey partner Jonathan Tilley, who helped lead the effort. “It’s not plug and play. I was nervous, and we all knew what a loss in output meant for people who needed ventilators.” During removal, teams would video-record and catalogue every screw, bolt, and connector to help the receiving teams put it all back together. The transit process was scrutinized for weather conditions and other variables. The team even consulted a satellite manufacturer to learn about preventing vibration damage en route to the new facility. “This entire move was conceived, decided, and completed in less than ten days,” Jonathan adds. “By working together, we all pulled it off.” The “lift and shift” success turned out to be one proof point in a massive success story. As the project progressed into the fall of 2020, Vyaire’s global delivery of ventilators crossed 35,000, with peak rates of more than 600 per day sustained on one product line, with more than 1,000 across all. “I still remember when the call came across to join this effort,” says McKinsey senior expert and associate partner Phil Duncan, who helped lead the work. “It was one of those moments in your career when you know you’ve just got to do it. It was a little nerve-wracking at points. It was emotional and meaningful. We all have a ton of pride in this because we did the work together.” Ten lessons on supply-chain readiness. By Ron Ritter Vyaire and Spirit got so much right in this unprecedented effort. Here’s what we learned from them. There is tremendous gain in getting this ever more right, as Vyaire and Spirit have shown us. Routine cost and delivery performance can improve through everyday enhancements across the organization. Stronger, more confident, and better-prepared organizational talent will build lasting culture around a sense of purpose. More rigorous design standards and better supplier networks are better able to respond with resiliency, and the brand will be stronger and more credible in projecting to the market. In normal days, operations will deliver better, faster, cheaper, safer. In a crisis, it may make all the difference in a decisive response. At peak, Vyaire was producing more ventilators in three days than their entire 2019 output. Over 19,000 units were built in the Kansas factory in just over 12 weeks by Spirit’s workforce. Similar feats were accomplished at other plants around the world, including among thousands of component suppliers. “We all worked together to create a state-of-the-art ventilator-production operation, supply chain, logistics, and workforce in less than six weeks that sent critical devices to patients in need around the world,” says Spirit’s CEO Tom Gentile. “I could not be prouder of what we all have done.” Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal agrees. “Yes, it was bold, and daunting at times, but there was never a chance we weren’t going to stand up to this moment,” he says. “Patients and customers were counting on us and our collective teams to meet the challenge.” This particular moment may have passed, and critical-care ventilator demand has since eased, but according to McKinsey’s Ron Ritter, the campaign nevertheless stands as an epic industrial success: “It also says a lot about what organizations can do when they have the courage to face what feels like an impossible objective, and inspire their people to do the same.” Related Practice To learn more about how McKinsey helps organizations improve manufacturing, please visit our Operations website , where you can also gain insight into CEO leadership of operations, supply-chain resilience , and much more.", "summary": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vyaire Medical collaborated with various partners to dramatically increase ventilator production.

That was when Wayne Brown, the operations manager at the Vistra-owned Martin Lake Power Plant, built and deployed a heat rate optimizer (HRO). About Vistra and its emissions-reduction goals Vistra Corp. is the largest competitive power producer in the United States and operates power plants in 12 states with a capacity of more than 39,000 megawatts of electricity—enough to power nearly 20 million homes. Vistra has committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent by 2030 (against a 2010 baseline) and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve its goals, the business is increasing efficiency in all its power plants and transforming its generation fleet by retiring coal plants and investing in solar- and battery-energy storage, which includes the world’s largest grid-scale battery energy-storage facility. Vistra’s to path to net zero will also require it to grow its zero-carbon portfolio to more than 7000 megawatts by 2026. The “heat rate” is a measure of the thermal efficiency of the plant—the amount of fuel required for each unit of electricity produced. To reach the optimal heat rate, plant operators continuously monitor and tune hundreds of variables, or “set points” on things like steam temperatures, pressures, oxygen levels, and fan speeds. It’s a lot for any operator to get right 100 percent of the time—so Vistra thought AI could help. Partnering for innovation With this goal in mind, Wayne and his group worked together with a McKinsey team that included data scientists and machine learning engineers from QuantumBlack AI by McKinsey , to build a multilayered neural-network model—essentially an algorithm powered by AI that learns about the effects of complex nonlinear relationships. This model went through two years’ worth of data at the plant and learned which combination of external factors—such as temperature and humidity—and internal decisions, like set points that operators control, would optimize the algorithm and attain the best heat-rate efficiency at any point in time. Vistra team members provided continuous guidance about the intricacies of how the plant worked, and identified critical data sources from sensors, which helped McKinsey engineers refine the model, adding and removing variables to see how those changes affected the heat rate. Through this training process, and by introducing better data, the models “learned” to make ever more accurate predictions. When the models were accurate to 99 percent or higher and run through a rigorous set of real-world tests, a McKinsey team of machine learning engineers converted them into an AI-powered engine. This generated recommendations every 30 minutes for operators to improve the plant’s heat-rate efficiency. At a meeting with all of Vistra’s leaders to review the HRO, Lloyd Hughes, a seasoned operations manager at the company’s Odessa plant, said, “There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon.” There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon. With this kind of power at their fingertips, Wayne and his team could make better, more informed decisions. Acting on the HRO recommendations helped Martin Lake run more than two percent more efficiently after just three months in operation, resulting in $4.5 million per year in savings and 340,000 tons of carbon abated. This carbon reduction was the equivalent of taking 66,000 cars off the road. 1 Calculations based on “ Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References “, United States Environmental Protection Agency If that doesn’t sound like a lot, consider this: companies that build gas-fueled power plants invest millions of dollars in research and development over four to five years to achieve a one-percent improvement in power-generation efficiency. Vistra hit that improvement level in only one-twentieth the amount of time using the data and equipment it already had. 2 Calculations based on source material from “A Brief History of GE Gas Turbines”, Power , July 8, 2019, and Frequently asked questions, US Energy Information Administration, last reviewed September 20, 2021 Creating value beyond the hype Vistra has since rolled the HRO out to another 67 power-generation units across 26 plants, for an average one-percent improvement in efficiency, and more than $23 million in savings. Along with the other AI initiatives, these efforts have helped Vistra abate about 1.6 million tons of carbon per year, which is ten percent of its remaining 2030 carbon-reduction commitment. That’s equivalent to offsetting about 50 percent of what a 500-megawatt coal plant emits. What happened at Martin Lake has happened at dozens of Vistra’s other power plants, with more than 400 AI models (and counting) deployed across the company’s fleet to help operators make even better decisions. It also reflects a core trait of Vistra’s AI transformation, which is that it isn’t a story of one massive hit, but rather the story of dozens of meaningful improvements snowballing to deliver significant value in terms of accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth. It’s also the story of how an organization architected an approach to rapidly scale every successful AI solution across the entire business. And it’s a story of how a continuous improvement culture, combined with a powerful AI modeling capability, helped leaders and plant operators do their jobs better than ever before. With more than $60 million captured in about one year of work and another $40 million in progress, Vistra is well on its way to delivering against a roadmap of $250-$300 million in identified EBITDA and more than two million tons of carbon abatement per year. The AI-driven advances at Vistra have heralded a generational shift in the power sector in terms of improvements in efficiency, reliability, safety, and sustainability.\nIf the one-percent improvement in efficiency the HRO delivered across the fleet was carried across all coal- and gas-fired plants in the US electric-power generation industry, 15 million tons of carbon would be abated annually—the equivalent of decommissioning more than two large coal plants or planting about 37 million trees. 3 The tree equivalency is based on calculations derived from the “The global tree restoration potential” study, published in the journal Science, July 5, 2019. That means less fuel needed to deliver power to the hospitals, schools, and businesses that rely on it. AI has the potential to bring similar levels of improvement to renewables as well, making them a more cost-effective and attractive energy option. Turning points on the AI journey Healthy skepticism and a culture of favoring action over words at Vistra meant that the biggest hurdle in the AI journey wasn’t the technology: it was the people. Vistra leadership and operations managers needed to know what AI could do and be convinced it could really work. It was this ingrained culture of continuous improvement—alongside a highly competitive market and a commitment to sustainability—that convinced Vistra’s leadership they needed to give AI a chance. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Seeing real possibilities The first question was a relatively simple one: “How can AI help improve the way Vistra generates power?” Answers to that question bubbled over when 50 of Vistra’s top leaders came to a McKinsey-hosted workshop. In multiple sessions, experts explained how AI worked, walked through detailed case studies showing how other companies used analytics and AI to generate value and gave live demonstrations of technologies, including digitized workflows and machine learning. Leaders in analytics from various sectors—including Amazon, Falkonry, Element Analytics, and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, as well as G2VP from the venture-capital world—provided insights and examples of how AI works. “I saw an example of how a metallurgical plant was using AI to help its operators optimize set points and it clicked for me,” remembers Patrick “Cade” Hay, the plant manager for Vistra’s Lamar power plant. “I saw how I could translate that into helping me run my own plants more efficiently. This was my lightbulb moment.” Company leaders and plant managers poured over process flow sheets and engineering diagrams to determine pain points as well as opportunities. This exercise allowed them to focus first on finding where the value was, then secondly on what technologies were needed to deliver it. Many of the operations opportunities were around yield and energy optimization and predictive maintenance, which according to our research, were the top AI use cases for manufacturing industries . By the end of the session, Vistra had developed a strategy to develop a series of AI solutions that could capture $250-$300 million in potential EBITDA while helping the company achieve its 2030 emissions-reductions goals. Codeveloping the AI While the analysis looked promising, proving it in the field was what mattered. “If our plant managers aren’t bought in, then things don’t happen,” explained Barry Boswell, Vistra’s executive vice president of power-generation operations. “So, we said, ‘Let’s pick a leader who is knowledgeable and skeptical, because if we can win them over, we can get everyone.’” They picked Cade. Not only did he run a top-performing plant in terms of profitability, reliability, and heat rate, he had a reputation for telling it like it is—Barry trusted Cade to tell him whether or not the value potential in AI was real. When he approached Cade about testing out a proof of concept to optimize duct burners, he was intrigued but predictably skeptical. Cade saw the potential in AI but was interested in finding out if it could actually help in the field. Duct burners essentially work like afterburners in jet planes; they provide a surge of energy when needed. Operators use them as supplements to hit energy targets, which are known as their “dispatch point.” The issue is that powering duct burners uses more fuel than regular methods, so it’s more expensive, generates more carbon emissions, and increases the wear and tear on equipment. McKinsey subject matter experts, data scientists, and analytics translators from QuantumBlack worked closely with a team from Vistra comprised of power generation and process experts as well as front-line operators to understand how the plant works, what data was available from the sensors already in place, and what variables could be directed—like the fact that the number of cooling fans running could be controlled, while the ambient temperature couldn’t. Working together Denese Ray, operations shift supervisor for Vistra’s Coleto Creek power plant; Doug Richter, the shift supervisor at the same plant; and Muro Kaku, McKinsey analyst and data scientist, discuss how they worked together. Denese: “Every week, I’d bring in a different supervisor to join us for our check-in calls with McKinsey. In this way, Muro and the McKinsey team saw what we were dealing with. We really needed all our supervisors and their feedback to build the model so we could get the most from it.” Muro: “That really mattered. For example, when we first trialed the HRO at the Coleto Creek plant, the recommendations were frequently rejected by the operators. We didn’t know why. When we spoke with the operators, they told us about specific rejection reasons, such as the tool recommended increasing superheat temperature by 30 degrees in a 15-minute interval to maximize the heat rate, but it takes the plant longer to heat up, so they rejected the recommendation. We then added a constraint to the tool to keep the increase and decrease to five degrees in a 15-minute interval, which operators could achieve.” Doug: “During load changes [increase or decrease in power output], the parameters are changing constantly, so recommendations to increase air flow at that time were counterproductive. We worked with McKinsey to have the recommendations stop for 30 minutes while we were changing load until the plant was stable again.” Denese: “We were all pretty skeptical of the tool at first, but when we got to play with the heat rate optimizer and see how it worked, and how well McKinsey worked with us in the plant, we understood how it could help.” As the teams developed the models, plant operators reviewed recommendations to see what made sense, what other variables needed to be tested, and what kinds of recommendations the operators would find most helpful. By analyzing the effect of various inputs and set points on the plant—such as pressure and humidity, the angle of blades in the gas turbine, usage of inlet cooling technologies, and the age and performance of various components like filters and condensers—and running it through the model, the analysis was clear: overall duct-burner usage could be reduced by approximately 30 percent, which would result in the equivalent of $175,000 of yearly savings on fuel costs and wear and tear on the system, in addition to an abatement of about 4,700 tons of carbon per year. “We worked closely with the team from McKinsey to develop AI models that reflected the realities of how power plants operate,” said Cade, “and then when we saw the recommendations coming out of the AI tool, I saw how much real value there was.” Going for scale and adoption from the beginning Vistra’s leadership realized from the beginning that the only way to achieve their efficiency and carbon-abatement aspirations was to scale every solution. “We manage the Vistra fleet as one. If a plant is doing something that works, we want every plant to do it,” says Barry. “That’s what we’re built to do.” That realization led Vistra to invest in a five-part system to scale and sustain AI solutions. *** AI solution deep dive QuantumBlack’s Ayush Talwar, an expert associate partner, provides more details on the AI model development: What kind of models did you use? We used a range of models to fit the specific needs of the plant and the solution. These ranged from Bayesian regression models to deep-learning models. How did you choose which model to use? We wanted to find the right balance between model performance, meaning its accuracy; explainability, which describes relationships to the operators; the source richness, which refers to the amount of data available; potential actionability, or how many of the most important features in the model people can actually control; and maintainability, which will reduce need for more technical skills to maintain them. How would you compare the models you used to older ones? Our models were more accurate than previous models, and importantly, more actionable. We used a variety of metrics to measure model performance such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Our models typically achieved MAPEs of less than 1.5 percent. How did you build up your models? Each neural network model was made up of several layers with each layer containing batch normalization, dropout, and activation. We created cross validation and out-of-sample testing sets using time-based splits to prevent overfitting models. We added features based primarily on domain expertise. How did you turn models into tools operators could use? We used machine learning models to make accurate predictions of outcomes. We then wrapped meta-heuristic optimization algorithms around those models to generate recommendations that helped operators make decisions about how to run the plant better. The models were then embedded within the existing production workflows and deployed live in the operator room. Vistra’s story is far from finished. As Cade put it, “We’re just looking at the tip of the iceberg.” Vistra’s roadmap for 2022 and 2023 includes bringing AI to its rapidly growing renewables fleet of solar and batteries to optimize yield and reliability, among other initiatives. To help sustain this ambition, Vistra is building up its talent bench. In addition to hiring a small team of data scientists and engineers, Rachit has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas to offer basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in AI and analytics for Vistra employees. Some 70 people have already completed courses, including those reskilling from statistics to machine learning. Vistra has also built relationships with local colleges and universities to develop internship programs and work with students in capstone projects to identify top technical talent. “We can’t sit around and just do what we did yesterday to be ready for tomorrow,” Barry says. “We’ve seen enough to know what’s possible.” The authors would like to thank Wayne Brown, Rachit Gupta, Patrick “Cade” Hay, Lloyd Hughes, Denese Ray, and Doug Richter from Vistra Corp., and Richard Bates, Dan Hurley, Pablo Illuzzi, Nephi Johnson, Muro Kaku, Jay Kim, George Lederman, Abhay Prasanna, Noel Ramirez, and Ayush Talwar from McKinsey.

Kana, who is now the director of brain health at the McKinsey Health Institute, is also a 25-year veteran in the behavioral health arena and knew the ER wouldn’t help her daughter—but there was no other option. The doctor recommended inpatient care, but no beds were available, so for three and a half days, Reina was confined to a glass-walled room under bright lights and constant surveillance, isolated from everyone except her mom, who slept in the hospital chair next to her as they waited for a bed to open up in the adolescent psych unit. “Sitting in an emergency room for days at a time, not being able to get the help your kid needs is devastating,” Kana says. “I had advocated for evidence-based mental health services throughout my career, yet couldn’t find them for my own child.” A growing behavioral health crisis Kana and Reina’s experience isn’t uncommon. In the United States, crises related to behavioral health, a term that refers to both mental and substance use disorders, have been on the rise for more than two decades—particularly among youth. Between 2009 and 2020, the United States saw a 30 percent increase in the national age-adjusted suicide rate. By winter of 2021 , the weekly rate of ER visits by adolescents who attempted suicide was 39 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the average rate for adolescent girls had increased 50 percent over the previous year. Despite these alarming numbers, community crisis-care resources remain limited. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline center, roughly 39 million Americans aged 12 and older could benefit from having access to a service for vulnerable people dealing with suicide, mental health, or substance use issues. Limited crisis services mean law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and ERs end up responding to most behavioral health crises, regardless of whether the individual is a threat to public safety or in need of emergency care. “What we're doing now is services that are high cost and low efficacy,” says Kana. “It’s the wrong recipe.” Dr. John Palmieri is a senior medical advisor and the acting director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Behavioral Health Crisis Team , which includes the 988 Lifeline. He spent the early part of his clinical career working in emergency psychiatric departments and witnessed firsthand the misdirection of care and resources for those in behavioral health crisis. “You see the downstream effects of where the system fails in so many ways when you’re in those settings day after day,” he says. “How are we looking upstream to prevent these crisis situations from happening in the first place or recurring?” A hotline to help those in need The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, passed in 2020, made “988” the official nationwide three-digit behavioral health crisis number as of July 2022. This meant that, for the first time, those experiencing a behavioral health crisis anywhere in the country would only have to remember three digits to find the appropriate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline first launched in 2005 as a ten-digit number. At the time, Kana was working for the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA, which oversaw the number’s rollout. Over the years, she watched the Lifeline evolve, expanding to include options for Spanish language, veterans’ crises, and disaster distress help lines. “I've been along for the journey of the growth of the Lifeline and saw advocacy from the field trying to advance a three-digit calling number,” she says. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. The new easy-to-remember number, while hugely promising, raises at least one potential challenge. Call volume—rising over the years—has already begun skyrocketing since the new number launched. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. To help localities and stakeholders across the country prepare for this surge, the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), the firm's non-profit-generating entity that focuses on addressing public health challenges, has been involved in a range of nationwide efforts. This includes helping ensure states, contact centers, first responders, and community behavioral health providers know exactly what they need to meet demand—be it new strategies, workforce training, data infrastructure upgrades, or other support. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Defining effective crisis care In December 2020, MHI came together with a group of national behavioral health and crisis-care stakeholders for a series of working sessions organized by Vibrant Emotional Health , the not-for-profit administrator of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; RI International , a global organization focused on the design and delivery of behavioral health crisis services; and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) . The goal was to help prepare for the launch of 988. MHI began by listening to 911 managers, mental health and substance-use treatment providers, contact center operators, and first responders to develop a consensus around the critical dimensions of crisis care. MHI gathered input from participating partners on what critical elements of community-based crisis care were necessary for the delivery of the 988 Lifeline. These conversations helped establish a shared understanding among stakeholders around the priorities of community-based crisis care: ensuring that anyone in crisis has someone to call, someone to help, and a safe place to go, as envisioned in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care . Simple as it sounds, this involves developing a continuum of care that includes the 988 crisis line staffed by local workers who can provide information, deescalate crises, and—when in-person support is needed—connect people with nearby services and relevant resources. Had this kind of response existed in 2019, Kana and her daughter would have had a place to go besides the ER; one that might have provided appropriate care and helped ease already constrained hospital capacity. About the McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating global entity within McKinsey. MHI strives to catalyze actions across continents, sectors, and communities to achieve material improvements in health, adding years to life and life to years. Core to this aspiration is improving brain health. Brain disorders take a significant toll on both life expectancy and quality of life. In particular, the urgent and rising rate of mental health, substance use, and suicidal crises globally calls for a transformation of access to mobile crisis response and community-based crisis services. Through its foundational collaboration-based approach, MHI brings together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health. The result is meaningful impact on initiatives like the rollout of 988 in the United States and similar multistakeholder partnerships on crisis care around the world. Measuring costs and savings involved What would it take to ensure such crises are handled by trained professionals—including clinicians, peers, and other provider types—across a coordinated continuum of care in every community? To help answer this question, MHI began working with RI International in 2021 to build the Crisis Resource Need Calculator , a web-based cost calculator that allows local leaders to see a projection of annual behavioral health crisis care costs by county or state. The calculator enables them to understand the cost of providing for every individual in need of local, in-person crisis care based on SAMHSA’s national guidelines. It also considers how many mobile crisis teams states and counties would need, and what resources that would involve to build out to scale. The Crisis Resource Need Calculator also highlights potential healthcare savings available by making this shift in resources. Overall, the calculator estimates that with fully resourced community-based crisis systems in place, the United States could save a total of $34 billion in annual behavioral health costs otherwise spent on ER visits and inpatient beds. Helping build an action plan In addition to care costs, MHI also attempted to better assess responder readiness for the transition to 988. To do this, from November 2021 to March 2022, MHI partnered with state, federal, and local entities to develop detailed operational assessment playbooks to help key audiences, including states, tribes and territories, crisis contact operators, 911 centers, and behavioral health providers with understanding how they can prepare for the change. “The McKinsey team has been the glue that helped put this all together,” says Brian Hepburn, executive director of NASMHPD, which partnered with SAMHSA to prepare for 988’s 2022 rollout. “The effectiveness of the work is dependent on what happens between meetings, and McKinsey filled those gaps with needed data.” In March 2022, the 988 playbooks were released at a gathering of federal, state, and local stakeholders from across the field. They have since been shared with organizations like the National Council of State Legislators and the National Governors Association to help inform the efforts to scale 988. They’ve also been distributed by partners including the National Emergency Number Association , the National Association for State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors , and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing . Each playbook is geared toward a specific crisis-response group, including 911 professionals, Lifeline network contact centers, mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers, states, territories, and tribes. The playbooks were designed to help state and local leaders understand whether they’re properly staffed, funded, and prepared for 988 response and how to get there. “These playbooks offer stakeholders a self-assessment of their own readiness and links to specific recommendations and tools,” says Brian. Ensuring equitable care One of the ongoing challenges these playbooks attempt to tackle is creating equitable crisis care across communities. Ensuring underserved communities have their unique needs taken into consideration is one of the biggest challenges facing the current system, says Shelby Rowe, director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center . Shelby, a citizen of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma who has personally experienced suicidal episodes, sits on the board of RI International and advocates for marginalized groups and tribal communities to get access to the full spectrum of crisis care.\n“If you’re a 15-year-old black trans girl, your experience asking for help in Brooklyn, New York is going to be very different from your experience asking for help in rural Oklahoma,” she says. Creating a more equitable system requires including diverse voices of those with lived experiences and addressing the underlying challenges and limitations facing specific communities. For example, tribal boundaries don’t always align to state lines, which keeps tribal communities from accessing crisis resource funding; the needs of vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ youth; the lack of access to crisis response in remote rural communities; the struggles people of color face when attempting to find medical or crisis help, and the list goes on. “We have an opportunity and an obligation to build a truly equitable crisis response system,” says Shelby. Creating a sustainable model Today, crisis response and stabilization services are primarily funded by federal, state, and local governments. Many crisis contact centers are transitioning from trained volunteer workforces to paid specialized staff. Yet an equitable, fully resourced continuum requires sustainable funding and commitment to meet diverse needs across communities. To support this, MHI and its collaborators, NASMHPD and SAMHSA, are working on several ongoing efforts. This includes examining healthcare claims to better understand how crisis services are paid for, developing a tool to forecast the number of healthcare workers a state or community needs for crisis care, and developing models and strategies to lessen the burden on the crisis workforce. The idea is that state and local governments, payers, and providers can use these resources to better support the current workforce, focus workforce development efforts, and plan for long-term financial sustainability. “The McKinsey team’s expertise in analytics helped identify some of the root-cause factors driving workforce shortages and what financing models can impact this journey along the crisis treatment system,” says SAMHSA’s John Palmieri. Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives. It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. All of these moving parts come together to steer a broader plan of action for crisis care in the United States. The five-year vision put forth by SAMHSA includes the goal of having 90 percent or more of all 988 calls answered in-state by the end of 2023, up from 71 percent in 2020 , and providing 80 percent or more of individuals in the United States with access to mobile crisis response and local services in the next two to five years. “What’s missing today is widespread, community-based approaches to managing suicidality, mental health crises, and substance use crises both for adults and kids,” says Kana. “Those are the services communities need and getting them actually costs much less and produces better outcomes.” Including for people like Reina. Since the initial frightening 2019 episode, Kana and her daughter had several others before the family found support through a local county-run organization offering in-home counseling and support to kids and families in need. Reina has since become an advocate for crisis support for teenagers and started a not for profit in her community to raise awareness for suicide prevention and youth mental health. “Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives,” says Kana. “It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. It’s going take a lot of cross-sector collaboration to transform our nation’s response to behavioral health crises, and MHI is a committed partner along the way.” Related Articles Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z Addressing employee burnout: Are you solving the right problem?

ECU Worldwide is one of the largest less-than-container-load shippers in the world, with 30 years of experience, servicing close to 2,400 trade routes across 180 countries and 40,000 port pairs across the globe. In December 2019, just before the start of the global pandemic, leadership from ECU Worldwide began working with McKinsey to chart a plan for an ambitious transformation – an 18-month program called “Voyager.” The program would lead ECU Worldwide to a complete organizational overhaul that put in place leadership co-ordination and new technology that offered a better experience for their global workforce and customers. As a result, ECU Worldwide saw sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries and an overall doubling of earnings from 2018 to 2021. And they achieved all of this during a period of unprecedented disruption in their industry. The challenge ECU Worldwide operates a 4,500-person team out of more than 300 offices across the world, including offices in India, the United States, and Europe. These locations have accelerated growth into new markets. But they have also brought new challenges to operational cohesion. Locations were run as independent units rather than as parts of an interconnected global business. Sales teams traditionally focused on order fulfillment and issue resolution, rather than customer pipeline building; and in more mature markets, like Europe and the United States, resource utilization wasn’t optimized. Some locations were operating beyond capacity while others were being underutilized. Founder and chairman Shashi Kiran Shetty knew ECU Worldwide needed a new growth strategy. “We believed the company could do far more in terms of market share,” says Shashi. “We needed a digital strategy that would make us future-ready and help build the company into a global leader in the logistics industry.” The solution As the pandemic began upending the global logistics industry, ECU Worldwide worked with McKinsey to focus their goals into a resilient, long-term growth strategy that built operational cohesion and created digital solutions to give them a competitive advantage. “ECU Worldwide wanted a strategy that would make them future-ready and better integrate their people and operations around the world,” says McKinsey associate partner Chandan Kansal . “We helped them think through what organizational changes and digital solutions could make this happen.” Partner Neelesh Mundra leads McKinsey’s logistics work in India and co-leads our manufacturing and supply-chain work in Asia. “More than 50 colleagues from our offices across the world, and experts from our capabilities like McKinsey Digital , Implementation , and People & Organizational Performance , helped bring the best of our firm to this transformation,” he says. After an intensive diagnostic sprint, McKinsey and ECU Worldwide developed Voyager, a transformation plan that featured four central pillars: improving sales efficiency, transforming operations using analytics, optimizing the customer journey, and creating a future-ready organization. How it was done McKinsey helped the company identify more than 15 geographies across three major markets – Europe, Asia, and North America – that comprised the majority of ECU Worldwide’s overall business. The company looked closely at how sales teams in these regions worked with their customers, defined growth milestones, and conducted customer analyses to pinpoint specific country challenges and potential. ECU Worldwide then began working to strengthen connectivity among their sales teams. McKinsey helped build a coordination center that tracks KPIs, shipment movements, and sales and pricing across geographies. Decisions in different parts of the world could now be made and communicated across the organization in real-time, rather than taking several days or weeks to coordinate as they traditionally had. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth After the first 18 months, the growth strategy had been systematically put in place. It featured two major components. Technology transformation How tech enablement sets ECU Worldwide apart A big enabler of ECU Worldwide’s transformation was creating and streamlining centralized technologies that helped track what was happening across priority markets. Prior to this streamlining, data was often reported in different formats across different offices and might take several months to aggregate and review. The company worked with McKinsey to build automated management dashboards that gathered data from each market into a centralized center. A newly revamped customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360 , used data science to create a customer-centric experience. By onboarding new products and vendors onto the platform, ECU360 created a digital ecosystem spanning users across more than 80 countries, the largest of its kind. A complete organizational redesign ECU Worldwide’s focus then shifted to performance management, which the company led out of a new dedicated transformation office. “The important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization and institutionalization of best practices,” says Sanchita Mohanty, vice president of transformation for ECU Worldwide. “We had a detailed talent-value assessment identifying the key recruits we wanted for the organization to achieve the aspiration that we had set for ourselves.” The very important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization. The automated dashboards gave ECU Worldwide a framework for company-wide performance reviews. The company could now institute KPIs that were common across geographies and tied to the organization’s overall goals. With everyone looking at the same data, workers could see how they were a part of one global organization, working toward common objectives, rather than operating in silos. This impact was then sustained through a newly set up Data Science and Analytics Centre of Excellence. The impact The technology transformation created efficiencies across various areas of the business, improving ECU Worldwide’s resilience along with their visibility and control over cargo movements in the supply chain. The customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360, brought more customer insights to ECU Worldwide, resulting in a 25 percent increase in adoption and 90 percent customer retention rate. A new sales app helped increase productivity for the client workforce with more than 60 percent of bookings now done on ECU360. A yield management tool tracked value leakages and demand spikes, enabling teams to revamp sales strategies. And a redesigned sales accelerator app helped increase productivity by 150 percent. Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership. They implemented the rigor needed to move the organization in the way it needed to move. “This transformation program, Voyager, institutionalized a new way of working within the organization,” says Adarsh Hegde, joint managing director for ECU Worldwide. “Today if you talk to anybody in our offices in China, Germany, or India, you will find the same language being spoken by them.” While forwarders globally saw earnings growth during the pandemic due to demand bottlenecks, ECU Worldwide’s sales program was distinct in that it focused on volume growth specifically, which had been stagnant for several years. By focusing on key markets, ECU Worldwide’s transformation covered 80 percent of overall sales, resulting in sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries as well as sales growth from newly integrated less-than-container-load and trucking services in the past two years. Operations processing time was also reduced by 30 percent thanks to a model office playbook developed and deployed across more than ten countries to streamline operations and set up an ECU Worldwide way of working. Getting this strategy right has enabled the company to start exploring its next bold moves in air freight and cross-border ecommerce. “Bringing focus and drive was a common goal we all aspired for. We’d grown through many acquisitions and needed a common ECU way of doing business,” says Tim Tudor, CEO of ECU Worldwide. “Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership.

In fact, given Scope 3 emissions in their supply chains, manufacturing, transport, and construction are the most emission-heavy sectors in the world. Danfoss is one organization working to change that. One of the largest producers of component parts for heating and cooling, drives, and power solutions, the Nordic company’s net-zero transformation is helping manufacturers around the world green their supply chains. Would you like to learn more about our Sustainability Practice ? The opportunity With more than 42,000 employees across the world, Danfoss produces thousands of components each year. Used across manufacturing industries, these components find their way into countless technologies essential to keeping everyday life moving for people the world over. The company, says CEO Kim Fausing, has an opportunity to make a powerful environmental impact. “We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification,” says Kim. “We want to be the best-in-class preferred partner for customers looking to decarbonize and are taking our own medicine—continuously making the way we run our business more energy efficient.” We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification. Kim and Jürgen Fischer, president of Danfoss Climate Solutions began having high-level discussions with McKinsey in the summer of 2021 about how best to engage customers -- makers of equipment across these emission-heavy sectors who use Danfoss’s component parts – to become their preferred partner in decarbonization. The question at the center of those conversations: What should Danfoss’s decarbonization target be and how could the company make a realistic plan to meet it? Setting a course for net zero Danfoss’s Climate Solutions business is responsible for producing heating and cooling machinery components. Teaming up with McKinsey sustainability experts, Danfoss looked for ways to decarbonize various aspects of it. They learned that while the highest carbon emissions come from the use of products across their entire lifecycle, the second largest source of emissions lies in the materials and construction processes. Product redesign and an alternative supply chain offered two possible ways forward. “Material decarbonization is the next frontier for advanced industries,” says McKinsey partner Jacob Staun. “We helped Danfoss map out the complexity of their supply chains to identify sources of emission and design solutions with a positive impact on cost and carbon.” Innovating with technology To facilitate and accelerate the process, Danfoss, with the help of McKinsey, developed a digital platform that assesses carbon emissions along the entire supply chain of each product. This tool, called Zero Carbon Product, from McKinsey’s Catalyst Zero solution, mapped the company’s bill of materials for each product against a library of around 600 decarbonization levers spanning 100 material categories. The result was a cost-optimized decarbonization roadmap showing, for example, alternative suppliers for certain materials like iron, steel, and aluminum, that could help Danfoss create low-carbon versions of existing products still at low cost. Partnering for success The next step in the process was to test the roadmap’s likelihood of success. Pilot journeys were created for five products from Danfoss’s Climate Solutions portfolio. An assessment of these initial five products found that for a minimal increase in costs, emissions from materials purchased to make each product could be reduced by as much as 95 percent. Here was a clear path to eliminating most emissions at low cost. The program pinpointed exactly where reductions could be made and how – an assessment that took hours rather than days with traditional methods – thereby creating an opportunity to scale the solution across Danfoss’s large product line. At the same time, McKinsey conducted customer interviews to better understand the price elasticity of low-carbon products. This would help Danfoss determine which suppliers to team up with to pilot some of these new sustainable product line solutions. Building capabilities The next question was one of scale. Danfoss’s entire portfolio comprises hundreds of product lines, each with anywhere from tens to hundreds of product variances. While Danfoss has around 5,000 suppliers, McKinsey’s analysis found that around half of total embodied emissions came from just 50 of those suppliers. This created a shortlist to focus on to have the greatest impact. Danfoss worked with McKinsey to build new capabilities, including embedding carbon assessments into product engineering and retraining employees to add decarbonization to their procurement strategy. “Building lower carbon products requires an entirely new way of working, one that requires new skill sets and embedding carbon reduction into every business process including procurement, product design, and go-to-market,” says McKinsey associate partner Jessica Fan. Decarbonizing at scale This has helped Danfoss achieve the goal of assessing its entire Climate Solutions product portfolio by the end of 2022 to create a clear product engineering roadmap moving forward. And it’s become part of a broader set of Science Based Targets : by 2030, Danfoss aims to reduce all direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy by 46.2 percent; reduce emissions across the value chain by 15 percent; and become carbon neutral across its operations. By the end of 2021 into early 2022, training personnel at Danfoss in how to move this decarbonization process forward became a priority. McKinsey deployed a train-the-trainer model, arming around 20 key Danfoss employees with the skills and tools needed to train employees across the organization to carry out this decarbonization mission. Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance. This train-the-trainer process involved identifying key people, making sure they were included in the initial five pilots, then conducting trainings and workshops so they could own the rollout of this new tool. The next step involved taking a closer look at the overall product launch strategy. While the company started with the Climate Solutions segment of its business, the goal is to complete this same process across its other two business units: Power Solutions, which makes up half of the overall business and Power Electronics and Drives, which accounts for another 30 percent. Danfoss is currently working with McKinsey in the proof-of-concept stage for its Power Electronics and Drives business as part of a two-and-a-half-year plan to roll out low carbon products across the entirety of the business. “Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance,” says Kim. “Danfoss is fully committed to both having a positive climate impact and also helping our customers become more climate-friendly through their use of our products and solutions.” Related Articles Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation An AI power play: Fueling the next wave of innovation in the energy sector How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "Danfoss, a global components manufacturer, is developing a carbon reduction roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.

But there is opportunity here. Building new workforce capabilities can accelerate inclusive growth for national economies, increase socio-economic mobility among workers, and help organizations improve their financial and operational performance. Investing in upskilling and reskilling workers is urgent, yet the playbook for doing so is outdated and won’t meet the multiplying need. McKinsey’s recent reskilling capability-building work with a regional government department in Australia shows what’s possible—and what scale could look like. A global skills crisis A McKinsey Global Institute survey found that 87 percent of companies worldwide reported experiencing skill gaps now or are expecting to within the next five years, impacting productivity and competitiveness at corporate and national levels. Our analysis shows that Japan will need a 2.5 fold increase in productivity growth over the next decade to maintain its recent GDP-growth rate. And the Tech Council of Australia forecasts that its nation will fall 200,000 tech workers short of its 1.2 million target by 2030, with only 7 percent of the non-tech workforce having a strong skills match with tech occupations. Nearly all respondents to the McKinsey Global Institute survey identified closing skill gaps as a main concern, yet only one-third of respondents say their organizations are prepared to address potential role disruptions. Only 28 percent say their organizations make effective decisions on how to close skill gaps. Upskilling and reskilling today’s workforce—in non-degree, skill-building programs—is critical to attracting and retaining talent while driving market competitiveness. “Hiring alone will not meet future workforce demands,” says Rod Farmer, a McKinsey associate partner in Sydney and leader of customer experience and design work in Asia-Pacific for McKinsey Digital. “We’re rapidly moving from a job-based to a skills-based economy requiring more nimble, tech-savvy, and multi-disciplinary teams. We’re seeing significant skills gaps emerging across all sectors of the Australian labor market and broadly across Asia.” One organization that understands this is Australia’s Department of Regional New South Wales (DRNSW), a government department supporting regional communities through agriculture, local infrastructure projects, soil conservation, environmental stewardship, economic development, and more. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated DRNSW’s need for a future-ready workforce. With most employees based in remote areas, many observed an increased need for digital skills but had not received the necessary technological training prior to the pandemic. Increased reliance on digital and data skills became both a strain on the agency’s productivity and accelerated digital inclusivity challenges. Identifying needs, seeing new potential At the onset of the pandemic, DRNSW took stock of its employees’ digital capabilities. The department uncovered a range of digital literacy challenges, ranging from frontline workers relying on friends and colleagues for help with basic digital tasks, such as emails and timesheets, to more complex tasks involving spreadsheets, where increased skills mastery was now essential. We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting. “We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting,” says Donna Mcleod, acting chief people officer of DRNSW. “It was a shock. We had to figure out how to make a fundamental, baseline shift.” DRNSW had tried traditional learning approaches in the past, which fell short of shifting needs and operating models. It needed to move beyond employees learning on their own, separately from their work, which often leads to surface knowledge acquisition only. “We saw there was a major need here—an opportunity for innovation and new capability building models within DRNSW where we could support the people of New South Wales, while also tackling a larger national skills-gap challenge,” says Rod. Over the next 12 months, DRNSW and McKinsey built an enterprise Digital Skills Program, creating an entirely different reskilling engine at the heart of DRNSW. Reinventing skill building McKinsey and DRNSW began their journey by reframing the challenge. DRNSW took an applied skills development approach, focusing on the jobs-to-be-done. This shift meant an increased focus on employee-backed, context-dependent, and on-the-job skills development—solving real day-to-day people development and productivity needs. Core to the DRNSW approach was contextualized learning: the notion that skill development does not happen in a classroom but while employees are on the job, with direct apprenticeship where they are able to immediately operationalize it. Human-centered design resulted in a program informed by a deep study of the individual’s and organization’s needs and pain points, brought to life through ethnographic research across regional and rural New South Wales, addressed in small peer-based groups with individual coaching, and supported by short feedback cycles. “One of the universal pain points we observed was that it’s very difficult for people to make time for upskilling and reskilling beyond their day-to-day responsibilities,” says Donna. “It was important for us to develop a program that placed skill building at the core of their workday, supported by peers and mentors.” The new DRNSW Skills Program helps to identify the specific skills, competencies and proficiency levels required at an organizational level within DRNSW roles. The program then helps assess employee skills, develop tailored programs to close the gaps, and support individuals in their role through direct peer-led coaching. Furthermore, the program scales from shorter upskilling modules to larger reskilling programs to support lateral internal hiring. “We now measure skills readiness in months, not years,” says Rod, who led the DRNSW’s skills transformation. “This isn’t a yearly one-and-done type of problem. Organizations need to institute continuous reskilling and upskilling if they are to maintain future-ready workforces.” To achieve this skills transformation, McKinsey and DRNSW worked with Mentem by UNSW. A new, independent business launched and backed by the University of New South Wales, Mentem helps corporate businesses upskill and reskill their employees at scale through tailored on-the-job training. This collaboration also provided employees the potential to receive micro-credentialling through time spent learning on the job—enabling access to credentialled learning at a global top 50 higher-education institution. Building Mentem by UNSW, a reskilling business UNSW—like many top universities—recognized the opportunity to further extend its post-graduate services beyond its more traditional offerings. Importantly, it also recognized that this challenge required the university to develop new operating and service models that leveraged its unique assets and heritage in adult learning, whilst accelerating product innovation and industry collaboration. To help realise its ambitions, UNSW partnered with Leap by McKinsey (McKinsey’s venture building capability) who helped design, build and launch the new venture at pace. “We’d never have been able to independently build a blueprint for a business this fast—we did it in 12 weeks, which is unheard of at a university for something of this magnitude,” says Arvind. “Mentem exists to provide new educational models for employer and workforce needs in Australia and globally,” says Arvind Sampath, founding chief executive officer of Mentem. “Working with DRNSW was an exciting opportunity to leverage our knowledge and revitalize a government agency we all rely on.” Another core element of the DRNSW Digital Skills Program is the ‘skills hub,’ critical for engaging the broader DRNSW organization and ensuring sustained impact as the program scaled. This new operational unit consists of a DRNSW squad with capability building specialists, human-centered designers, instructional designers, and program delivery experts. To evaluate impact and prove the viability of scaling up the new program, Mentem developed a unique learning analytics platform that measured individual and cohort performance over time, leveraging learner management system analytics, project results, and coach feedback. The platform also provides automated interventions, or nudges, to individuals and coaches to drive program engagement and behavior change. Transformative results For DRNSW, the results exceeded expectations—and in record time—with over 90 percent employee satisfaction and 85 percent of participants reporting improved applied skills. The 8-week courses are now scaling across DRNSW. “Other agencies couldn’t believe we built, piloted and started scaling this entire new approach to capability building in six months when this can typically take two or three years in government,” Donna says. “It was a phenomenal delivery.” Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. These types of changes, scaled throughout the agency, increased productivity and delivered improved services for constituents. Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. The program has already been recognized for its impact and employee-centric approach, winning the Best in Class award in the public-sector category from Good Design Australia, one of the most prestigious design awards in the world. But the biggest testament to its success is the difference it made in the careers of the employees. “You have to realize, this has absolutely changed people’s lives,“ says Donna. Participants reported very high levels of increased confidence in performing their work, value from their coaches and overall satisfaction with the program. “The program was very different from anything I’ve done before,” says Charlene, who completed the program. “The coaching was my highlight of the week.” “To do these jobs, the way everything’s going digital, you need to upskill to get there,” says Glenn, another participant. “I thought, ‘wow, this program is for me.’” The stakes for DRNSW were high—delivering government services that drive value for citizens is essential. But for corporate institutions, it could very much be a question of survival. “If a government agency like DRNSW can make such a major shift with a traditionally non-digital workforce, then enterprises can meet the moment too.” says Roland Dillon, a partner with McKinsey’s Public & Social Sector practice based in Melbourne. “Not doing so could lead to an existential crisis as competitors not only leapfrog the market, but do so while taking talent that is hungry to learn and develop in an increasingly digital world.” Related Articles Future of  Work Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "A government agency in Australia, DRNSW, is addressing the global skills crisis by implementing a Digital Skills Program in collaboration with McKinsey.

Many of them shop at Makro, a well-known Thai wholesaler, to meet that demand. The global pandemic has highlighted the essential role these wholesale suppliers play in society—and the opportunity they have, to accelerate their own digital transformations, build new e-commerce capabilities, and better serve customers. When leaders at CP AXTRA Public Company Limited decided to make a digital transformation, they partnered with McKinsey to identify the right strategy, lead with technology, and ensure their transformation would endure. The opportunity The first B2B online platform of its kind Makro was only capturing 10 percent of buyers’ share of wallet. Their customers typically went to other suppliers, from smaller vegetable producers to wet markets, to fulfill their commercial needs. “That adds a lot of operational overhead for them, causing a lack of efficiency in running their businesses,” says Tirayu Songvetkasem, chief digital officer of CP AXTRA. The advent of the pandemic accelerated these challenges and helped create momentum to solve for this customer need. We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working. “Makro comes from a very classic business background,” says Paul Howe, group chief information officer of CP AXTRA . “We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working.” How it was done Building products, teams, and a trust-based relationship Leap by McKinsey experts partnered with CP AXTRA to build a new digital platform where business owners could access a real-time view of wholesale inventory from hundreds of suppliers in a single app. Known as Makro PRO, the platform offers streamlined goods-purchasing for hotels, restaurants, and cafes. “Building Makro PRO from scratch was a new experience for us. For the platform to be successful, we needed a very solid and future-ready technology stack and architecture,” says Yanawee Sarotnunjeen, a product owner at Makro PRO. “We worked with McKinsey to help us accelerate the technology build and make it secure and highly scalable. McKinsey brought in expert digital talent, including product builders and strategists, software engineers, data scientists and designers—and embedded them within our team. Today the technology that supports Makro PRO has been embedded into other parts of our organization.” As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth. After the initial build, CP AXTRA knew it had to build its own tech talent bench to sustain and scale the platform. “We worked with McKinsey to hire and build tech capabilities systematically across different roles and seniority levels,” says Yanawee. “In six months, we grew the Makro PRO team from 0 to 60 people.” Over the project, McKinsey helped CP AXTRA to embed upskilling and professional development into the fabric of the organization’s culture, building capabilities of more than 200 colleagues who are dedicated to Makro PRO, and updating compensation and benefits for the company. As Dymfke Kuijpers, a McKinsey senior partner who leads our retail work globally and our consumer work in Asia explains: “As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth themselves. In the end, tech is never the bottleneck—a lack of people and capabilities are.” Uncovering pain points Building a minimum viable product from scratch “We were true partners across each and every part of the business build, working as one team,” says Tomas Laboutka, a McKinsey expert associate partner. “This kind of collaboration made it easy to share ideas, test and iterate quickly, and ultimately create a trust-based relationship that was critical as we worked remotely most of the time.” The impact Unlocking opportunities for employees, small farmers, and businesses alike Over the last two years, CP AXTRA has reskilled more than 200 employees to support its omni-channel business and Makro PRO platform, which now processes thousands of orders daily with tens of thousands of products available on the platform. Elsewhere, CP AXTRA expands the opportunity for sellers like small farmers to reach customers. “This impact is a result of a shared vision and excitement that we have with CP AXTRA for building a new business that can benefit many local businesses–the heartbeat of the Thai economy,” Tomas says. As Noppamas Sivakriskul, a McKinsey senior partner and the managing partner of our Thailand office, says: “This is a brand I’ve grown up with and loved. I’ve had the chance to partner with its leadership team for nearly a decade. This is an idea that we’ve been exploring for a few years.

While 40 to 45 percent of those chats usually get resolved by the current classic chatbot, that still leaves another 16,500 customers a week needing to speak with a live agent for help. This can leave customers with potentially longer waiting times as they’re only able to get live help for non-urgent requests during working hours. Generative AI’s ability to interact with human language in ways simply not possible before created an opportunity for teams from QuantumBlack, McKinsey's AI arm, and ING to explore how advanced chatbot technology could be used to improve the customer experience, giving customers the assistance they need immediately. This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry. From idea to impact The Solution Developing advanced chatbot capabilities A joint ING and McKinsey team worked closely together for seven weeks to build a generative AI chatbot that offered customers immediate tailored help while maintaining clear guardrails to mitigate risk. The team started with an in-depth analysis of the existing chatbot to identify specific challenges. The final solution consisted of a multi-step pipeline to generate the best answer for the customer including knowledge retrieval from available data stores and a ranking of potential answers by helpfulness. In the case when several helpful answers arose, the system would offer multiple options to the customer – a process called disambiguation. Lastly, before any answer was sent to the customer, a series of guardrails was applied. In order to do this, ING risk stakeholders were brought into this process from the very start and ING-specific guardrails (to avoid giving advice on mortgages and investment products, for example) were built using out-of-the-box tools from QuantumBlack Labs , our AI and machine learning innovation hub. The gen AI chatbot was released on testing days to 10 percent of real customers in the Netherlands who were using the support chat function on the mobile app. It offered a customer experience that was demonstrably superior to the classic chatbot, providing customers with much more detailed and tailored responses, and helping them resolve their queries faster. Since launching in September 2023, thousands of customers have interacted with the new gen AI chatbot, making it the first-of-its-kind real-life customer-facing pilot conducted in Europe. “By prioritizing real customer needs, security, and ease of use, ING was able to develop a bespoke customer support tool that gives users the best possible experience,” says ING chief operating officer Marnix van Stiphout. The Impact At the forefront of gen AI applications in banking When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers. “When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers,” says McKinsey senior partner and co-leader of the Global Banking and Securities Practice Stephanie Hauser . As part of a broader effort, ING focused on capability building across more than 50 support functions – in the Risk department, Contact Center department, and Analytics Office and Technology – giving ING a lighthouse case to more broadly scale their gen AI efforts. Working together, the ING and McKinsey team created a path to double performance of the chatbot in the next six months, build a scalable model that can be extended to all other ING countries, and setup a technical foundation for ING to address a wide set of gen AI use-cases across the Group. The efforts helped define a blueprint to scale across ten markets with the potential to impact more than 37 million customers across 40 countries. “This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry,” says Bahadir Yilmaz, ING Chief Analytics Officer. “Gen AI technology will further evolve and we feel well-positioned to leverage those developments in order to offer the customer the best experience and remain a technology leader in our industry.” Lessons Learned Let’s connect Andrea Del Miglio Senior PartnerMilan Carlo Giovine PartnerLondon Stephanie Hauser Senior PartnerLondon Mohcine Ouass PartnerAmsterdam Niels Van der Wildt PartnerLondon Related Generative AI QuantumBlack Labs", "summary": "ING has implemented a generative AI chatbot to enhance customer support, resolving issues more efficiently compared to traditional chatbots.

It oversees a vast network of passenger airlines and aviation service companies. 2023 ESG Report: Accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth for all Up until 2022, Lufthansa housed its data across 14 separate ERP applications. This meant that their spend management solution was able to provide an overview at a high level. The company recognized that if they could gain more transparency across these data sources, they would be able to identify actionable spend insights at more granular levels across the organization. Lufthansa wanted to track more accurately what they were sourcing and paying for; this would open a channel to strengthen their procurement strategies, help identify more savings, and better understand their carbon footprint. “Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems,” says Holger Koenig, enterprise architect for Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “We wanted to break down data silos, simplify the delivery of trusted data faster across all our systems, and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources.” In 2022, leaders began working with McKinsey on a SaaS solution. It would need to play well with their own implementation of SAP’s Business Technology Platform (BTP) and translate siloed data streams into a consolidated, global view of procurement spend. It was called Spendscape. The Solution A fully integrated SaaS software Spendscape provides a comprehensive understanding of procurement spending. McKinsey adapted it to integrate with SAP’s BTP to enable data and analytics-driven management and create holistic visibility across the supply chain. Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems. We wanted to break down data silos... and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources. “Sophisticated organizations require superior data and insights for decision making. Procurement has gotten significantly more complex with carbon emission targets, managing supply risk, and inflation and deflation factors coming into play,” says McKinsey partner Björn-Uwe Mercker . “We now have a lot of volatility in the market, which drives the need for a super-fast reaction time. To do this, you need a data model and analytics that can keep up.” Fully integrating the Spendscape SaaS software onto SAP’s platform would create a 360-degree view of Lufthansa’s procurement performance. First implemented at Lufthansa Technik, a business focused on maintenance and repair of aircraft, and now being rolled out across the group, the tool is creating greater spend transparency across sourcing systems, simplifying data integration processes, and informing supplier negotiations to help reduce costs. For example, future purchasing decisions could be made using not just a full picture of external costs and spending across the value chain but also with the added layers of near-real-time data on price volatility and carbon emissions -- leading to smarter decision making and procurement across the board. Once fully realized across the group, the successful implementation of this tool could have far-reaching implications. It will provide better metrics across operations, including risk analytics, supplier negotiation, working capital, monitoring of material cost and procurement performance, among other areas. “With Spendscape, we aspire to build one comprehensive spend analytics platform for Lufthansa, fully embedding it into our IT architecture strategy,” says Lennart May, senior director procurement, Lufthansa Group. “This will deliver actionable insights and be integrated with future systems.” This reduces the number of tech components they need to use on the backend and allows for a solution that’s fast and scalable for future systems. The Impact Optimizing cost and carbon reduction decisions Spendscape has already uncovered actionable spend insights for Lufthansa Technik, where it was first deployed. It has also made it easier to collaborate across business units and provided a tool for data model changes and near-real time cash position management. The impact goes beyond financial and operational improvements. With the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive taking effect at the start of 2024, Lufthansa also needs to strengthen and prioritize capabilities and transparency around upstream Scope 3 emissions reporting. Spendscape unites procurement data from more than ten ERP systems into a single taxonomy. The result is a searchable source of truth combining information on carbon footprint across categories, down to the consumption and invoice level. This made it possible for Lufthansa to create comprehensive Scope 3 emissions transparency and collaborate more effectively with suppliers to improve reporting accuracy and optimize decisions for both carbon reduction and cost savings. “This is one of the more sophisticated use cases that goes well beyond classic spend reporting ,” says Björn. “Spendscape’s ability to create more transparency around Scope 3 emissions shows just how powerful a sophisticated data landscape can be in transforming the way businesses are run.” Related case studies McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation Building a next-generation carbon platform to accelerate the path to net zero Let’s connect Björn-Uwe Mercker PartnerMunich", "summary": "Lufthansa is using the Spendscape SaaS solution to consolidate spend data from multiple ERP systems, enhancing procurement visibility and decision-making.

And yet, the process for identifying, vetting, buying, and managing carbon credits around the world has proven labor-intensive and hard to scale for many companies. It often requires them to conduct their own due diligence for each project they consider funding. This nascent market includes an evolving and often subjective definition of quality, varying degrees of carbon removal permanence, lack of price transparency, and uncalculated risk. Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants. In the face of such growing demand and complexity, the private equity firm and global alternative asset manager TPG saw the need for a more sophisticated approach to accessing carbon markets. Leadership at TPG Rise Climate, TPG’s dedicated climate-focused private equity fund, saw an opportunity to leverage the tools of more mature markets—diversification, active management, and risk management—to address barriers to scaling efficient voluntary carbon markets. They partnered with McKinsey to build a new platform that would fill critical gaps in the market. What’s behind a Rubicon Carbon Tonne? Rubicon Carbon creates diversified portfolios of high-quality carbon credits called Rubicon Carbon Tonnes or RCTs. These portfolios are offered as curated baskets of credits or can be customized to fit a company's net-zero plan. The RCT is designed to reduce risks and increase options for climate-ambitious corporate buyers. Rubicon Carbon offers three curated RCT portfolios: nature-based emissions avoidance and reductions, industrial emissions reductions, and carbon removal. The RCT uses the tools, logic, and lessons of finance to enable companies to invest safely in carbon credits. “Rubicon Carbon constructs and oversees collections of high-quality carbon credits that have gone through a professional vetting process and are monitored on an ongoing basis,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane. “Their model essentially provides carbon credits as a service, allowing their customers to seamlessly access market-leading capabilities and tools.” “Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane . “TPG and McKinsey asked: How can we partner to build the next generation carbon platform and do it fast enough to create a market leader in a rapidly evolving space?” McKinsey worked with TPG to create Rubicon Carbon , an easy-to-use, transparent, enterprise-grade digital platform that offers innovative, high-quality corporate carbon products at scale in order to accelerate global sustainability and carbon removal. From idea to impact The Solution An innovative risk-adjusted carbon credit portfolio Over the course of less than 12 months, we worked alongside TPG to build and launch the Rubicon Carbon platform, applying a real capital markets approach to innovation in carbon markets. This included market research and segmentation, developing the business and product concept, using Leap business building strategies , business planning and execution, and helping secure sponsor launch funding. The work centered on establishing Rubicon Carbon as an enterprise-grade partner that brings sophisticated capabilities to corporate customers so that they don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every carbon credit transaction. Priorities to get there included coming up with a science-based approach to identifying high-quality credits, vetting the numerous attributes that drive quality and value to customers, and navigating the shifting landscape of risks in the market by actively managing baskets of credits over their life cycle. “Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time,” says Rubicon Carbon chief science officer Dr. Jennifer Jenkins. “By including a diversified portfolio of carbon projects, applying rigorous quality guardrails, and conducting ongoing monitoring and risk adjustments, we’re able to lower the risk assumed by buyers.” Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here. Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors. Over the course of six months, our team helped co-create a tech infrastructure and platform that integrated transaction management, carbon credit custody, customer portfolio management, and full enterprise technology architecture. The work included corporate onboarding and accounted for the necessary compliance features along with bespoke carbon credit purchasing and inventory management. “Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here,” says McKinsey associate partner Charles Riesenberg. “Previously, buyers in the market had to find and diligence individual carbon credit projects in different parts of the world, which creates an incredibly complex market.  Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors.” The Impact Connecting companies to meaningful climate projects TPG and Rubicon Carbon accelerated the platform’s time to market and customer acquisition over the course of six months. In addition to overseeing the asset management platform build, McKinsey helped refine the product and offering strategy, designed initial product portfolios, and helped design the new company’s org structure. What began as 25 full-time employees, two MVP products, and a coalition of 15 corporate launch partners (including McKinsey), has now grown to become a market leader in next-generation carbon solutions including four distinct product offerings and a $1 billion capital mobilization goal. Rubicon Carbon has created a reliable way for companies with long-term carbon reduction goals to make a more immediate impact in offsetting their emissions. Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time. It's already making a difference around the world. For example, through one project alone, 150,000 hectares have been preserved in Borneo. Elsewhere, methane emissions are being cut in Bangladesh, and 5,000 acres in Africa are being reforested to expand the habitat for endangered gorillas. \"It’s clear that companies must reduce emissions within their value chain, but to balance remaining emissions that can't be eliminated right now, we also need to scale high-quality carbon credits,” says Rubicon Carbon CEO Thomas Montag. \"Rubicon Carbon helps direct corporate funds toward meaningful climate projects in need of capital and moves us closer to reaching the ambitious net zero goals our planet needs.\" Let’s Connect Sean Kane Charles Riesenberg Related case studies From farm to tablet: Building a new business to solve an old challenge Made in Africa: Catalyzing stronger, sustainable, and inclusive economies How a global components manufacturer built an ambitious carbon reduction roadmap", "summary": "Rubicon Carbon, developed by TPG and McKinsey, creates diversified portfolios of high-quality carbon credits to facilitate corporate climate action.

While retail spaces must comply with ADA codes, once elements like moveable furniture and merchandise are added, accessibility can become limited. Starbucks is hoping to set an elevated standard of accessibility by going beyond ADA requirements to create spaces that make everyone feel welcome. With 16,000 stores in the U.S., the coffee giant knew it had a big opportunity to catalyze change for this large and diverse population. Starbucks wanted to make accessible design the rule rather than the exception for its customers and employees. “Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody,” says Katie Young, Starbucks SVP of Store Operations. “We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores.” Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores. In 2021, Starbucks began working with McKinsey to develop elements of inclusive store design to reduce friction for those with disabilities and support independence for all in any built retail environment. The work included understanding potential points of exclusion and creating guidelines – what Starbucks now calls the Inclusive Spaces Framework – to make spaces more accessible for persons with disabilities. “The entirety of this work was not just about building something that’s just specific to Starbucks,” says McKinsey partner Anne Kronschnabl. “They wanted to develop guidelines to help change the retail industry at large. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it.” The Solution Minimizing points of exclusion McKinsey worked with Starbucks to identify barriers that may exist for people with disabilities throughout the customer journey. Heatmaps showed pain points around entering the store, ordering, and navigating spaces like the drive-thru and restrooms. Then the team worked on ideating potential solutions to eliminate or minimize points of exclusion throughout those spaces. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it. One critical element of the approach was that persons with lived experiences were an integral part of the team, participating in every step of the work. “We were very intentional about who we had on our working team and made sure we had people representing different disability types involved in ideation and prioritization,” says Anne. “We made sure to have lots of involvement from individuals with lived experiences.” This led to a set of proposed changes such as wider spaces to allow easier access for wheelchair users, better signage in critical locations and at varying heights, and a variety of sound and lighting zones to accommodate varying sensory needs. Starbucks also wanted to focus on the employee experience. We looked at the employee journey and redesigned employee spaces with accessibility as a priority. More inclusive equipment was introduced, including a new drip brewer designed with a larger dial and visual and haptic feedback. The Impact A new set of accessibility guidelines In February of 2024, Starbucks opened its first retail space designed using this inclusive spaces framework in Washington, DC. It now plans to scale the design efforts across more stores. It’s a significant commitment. This year Starbucks plans to grow its U.S. footprint by around 4 percent, with plans to open around 600 new stores in addition to the existing 16,000 stores across the U.S. Growth plans will include the use of these new accessibility guidelines so that all newly built and renovated Starbucks company-operated stores in the U.S. will incorporate these more inclusive design elements. The retailer is also thinking beyond its own walls. Starbucks plans to share this inclusive design framework with other retailers and is standing up an Inclusive Spaces Coalition. The hope is that more retailers across the U.S. and beyond will use these learnings to make their built environments as inclusive as possible for customers and employees. “This framework defines how Starbucks will help expand independence, choice, and ease for all people across physical and digital spaces,\" says Starbucks CEO, and McKinsey alum, Laxman Narasimhan in a LinkedIn post . \"Developed alongside a diverse community of customers, partners, and accessibility experts, the framework will be open-source to help expand accessibility across the entire retail industry.\" Our People Anne Kronschnabl Becca Coggins Related case studies 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Protecting workers through award-winning design", "summary": "Starbucks aims to enhance accessibility in its stores by exceeding ADA requirements, collaborating with McKinsey to create an Inclusive Spaces Framework.

This week, nonprofit Opportunity@Work and the Ad Council have launched a nationwide campaign to ‘ Tear the Paper Ceiling ’ and encourage employers to change hiring practices. McKinsey is providing pro bono support to the effort through data and analytics tools that enable recruiters to recognize STARs and their skills. “While companies scramble to find talent amid a perceived skills gap, many of their job postings have needlessly excluded half of the workers in the country who have the skills for higher-wage work,” says Byron Auguste , founder of Opportunity@Work and a former senior partner at McKinsey. “Companies like the ones we're proud to call partners in this effort—and those we hope will join—can lead the way by tapping into skilled talent from a far wider range of backgrounds.” McKinsey has driven extensive research on skills-based hiring and human capital , and built data-driven solutions that help employers implement new ways of screening for knowledge, skills, and capacity to learn. “A few years ago, we looked at many talent solutions in the market. There was a real risk of hard-wiring outdated notions of being a skilled worker,” says McKinsey partner Carolyn Pierce , who leads the technology team in the People and Organizational Performance practice . “Those systems gave little credit even to our own team members for skills learned on the job.” People & Organizational Performance: Equipping people and organizations to unleash sustained performance Carolyn and her team began collaborating with Opportunity@Work to prove the value and transferability of skills developed through work experience. “The Opportunity@Work team has done some incredible research that makes the business case for hiring STARs into today’s most in-demand jobs” says Carolyn. Our pro bono support will help make those insights more widely available to employers. “We increasingly hear from employers that they want to recruit from the STARs talent pool,” says Shad Ahmed, COO of Opportunity@Work. “But they need practical, data-driven tools to replace degree screens and hire STARs. The portal we are building with support from McKinsey will help employers identify which jobs should be open to STARs and help them source from this valuable talent pool. It’s a key part of our mission to create vital technology infrastructure wired for inclusion.” McKinsey is committed to tearing the ‘paper ceiling’ in our own hiring practices. “We have made significant investments to ensure that our own talent culture is both distinctive and inclusive, attracting and developing talent from a wide range of backgrounds,” says Katy George , senior partner and CHRO of McKinsey. “We are investing in more ways to recruit, hire, and grow STARs through a holistic approach that recognizes candidates’ skills and experience, problem-solving ability and intrinsic capabilities.” McKinsey’s technology organization is at the forefront of this effort, with many entry-level roles already open to STARs who have the necessary knowledge and skills. “We already have technologists at the firm—from entry-level through partner—who are STARs,” says Katy. “Our technology teams work on important and challenging problems, from helping organizations reduce their carbon footprint to improving worker safety. Our best path to solving these problems is to attract talented people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Our recruiting teams are actively working to make more STARs aware of these opportunities and encourage them to apply.” Creating more opportunities for STARs requires more than simply removing degree requirements from job descriptions. “We are scaling support for apprenticeships, bootcamps, and training programs to accelerate pathways for STARs into our firm” adds Katy. “The programs will help STAR talent build any additional skills needed for success at McKinsey and beyond.” There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential. We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up. Byron is hopeful that having McKinsey as a sponsor of this campaign will encourage more employers to change their talent practices. “A lot of organizations know that McKinsey is very data driven. It’s a strong signal that they are helping to build better ways to screen for talent and creating opportunities for STARs through their own hiring,” he says. Challenging the misconceptions associated with not having a college degree is key to helping more people tear through the paper ceiling. “Screening for a degree is one way to find people with skills and the capacity to learn—the problem is that you’re also screening for who had the right social and economic conditions in place to attend college,” says Carolyn. “There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential,” Carolyn adds. “We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up.” related No such thing as a dead-end job, new McKinsey research finds Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey supports the \"Tear the Paper Ceiling\" campaign, promoting upward mobility for over 70 million skilled workers in the US.

Scaling supply chains and infrastructure, developing analytics tools to assess climate risk, reskilling workers in highly carbon-dependent markets, and more will have a massive impact on our ability to stabilize global temperatures in line with the 1.5C-degree pathway. To help our clients reach their sustainability and broader ESG goals, we have launched Sustainability Academy , a capability-building program that helps organizations better equip their talent for the net zero transition. “Making our economic system more sustainable and more inclusive is an imperative that is felt by all types of stakeholders, from governments and regulators, to clients, suppliers, and end consumers,” says partner Pietro Sorrentino , who helps lead Sustainability Academy. “Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that: help companies accelerate change by supporting them in building new knowledge for their employees.” The program was designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy —our capability building center of excellence—and follows a simple approach: acquire, apply, and sustain. First, Sustainability Academy offers formal learning experiences to help talent acquire new knowledge and skills through practice and feedback. Second, teams apply these mindsets and capabilities in a real-world context, where impact materializes. Finally, we help organizations sustain new practices and habits to unlock lasting behavioral change. Sustainability Academy has launched with two foundational programs. Our Executive Masterclass kickstarts transformations by aligning senior executives with the mindsets and skills required to deliver their sustainability agendas. Sustainability Transformation Essentials, meanwhile, helps clients develop enterprise-wide awareness of core sustainability concepts, including the climate transition, solving the net-zero equation, and capturing new business opportunities. The program is already driving impact with clients. Recently, we partnered with a Fortune 500 company to accelerate their net-zero journey, helping them become an industry ESG leader. In this case, the client had articulated clear sustainability targets—including reaching net zero for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. But leaders needed to equip their teams with the practical skill sets needed to engage both internally and externally with stakeholders and suppliers. This is a common challenge: industry benchmarks show that in some sectors, nearly 100 percent of companies have defined and communicated sustainability strategies, but only 40 percent believe they have sufficient internal knowledge and capabilities to achieve their targets. Given that about 90 percent of our client’s emissions fell into Scope 3 (within the supply chain and not directly owned by the organization), equipping their talent with capabilities to engage their suppliers was particularly important. Sustainability Academy The company asked McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy to help their talent build the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they needed to engage with their suppliers to reduce emissions across the value chain. Together, we co-developed a multimodal journey—integrating fieldwork, digital learning, and live workshops—to help the client’s category managers prepare for conversations with suppliers. This journey looked at key emissions categories, such as distribution and logistics, identifying the sustainability opportunities to discuss with suppliers and internal stakeholders. It also provided modules on how to best lead the supplier discussions and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The same client also sought to increase spend with diverse companies by more than $1 billion across their tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We partnered with the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion team to create robust diversity programs and track against diversity targets. These efforts culminated in a virtual supplier summit with more than 200 suppliers and more than 1,000 internal and external attendees. Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that... These efforts delivered significant impact on both the sustainability and inclusion fronts. Supplier commitments to science-based targets increased by more than 50 percent from the baseline, and gains were made on supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion, with additional commitments on tier 2 reporting and identification of new business opportunities with tier 1 diverse suppliers. “Completing the online training modules, supported by the virtual forum sessions and open office hours, helped our client’s people build a fact-base for working with their suppliers, which enabled them to have productive conversations at the supplier summit,” says partner Maria Fernandez . “Today, this work is the foundation upon which their multi-year ESG transformation resides.” If your organization is interested in working with Sustainability Academy, please email us . related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy aims to upskill workers for the net-zero transition, focusing on capability-building to meet sustainability goals.

With the evisceration of manufacturing jobs, it needed a major transformation. In 2011, the state had a novel idea. Using profits from the beverage industry, Ohio formed a new entity—a first-of-its-kind, state-authorized non-profit—to stimulate economic growth through new industries: JobsOhio . Over the next decade, the state saw nearly one million jobs created or protected. McKinsey was a key early partner, helping develop JobsOhio’s growth plan that identified ten sectors with opportunities for employment, such as aerospace and aviation, healthcare, logistics and distribution, technology, and financial services. In 2010, Ohio ranked 49th for job growth rate in these ten sectors. By 2022, they ranked 20th in job growth rate and had added $13 billion in payroll. The state’s job creation was its best ever, but JobsOhio wanted to ensure its strategy would be effective going forward. In 2018, the initiative asked McKinsey to issue a report evaluating its performance. “JobsOhio was in a class by itself in terms of economic development organizations as far as dollars per job, attracting companies, capital investments, and more,” says Ben Safran , a partner at McKinsey who worked on the report. “But we also found it needed to address approaching headwinds in the broader macro economy.” Brendan Buescher , a McKinsey senior partner based in Cleveland, says the findings encouraged JobsOhio to think locally. “They were certainly performing well against comparable organizations,” says Brendan, “but we urged them to measure success against the needs of Ohioans.” The case for inclusive growth The report helped shape JobsOhio’s 2.0 strategy, which expanded its industry-focus to include a new emphasis on workforce, innovation, infrastructure and investment throughout the state. From this, JobsOhio developed Innovation Districts in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—, multi-organization partnerships plan to create 60,000 jobs and establishing Ohio as a global leader in healthcare, life sciences, and technology in these three regions. As the new strategy was getting off the ground, COVID-19 rocked the state’s economy. Partnering with McKinsey again, JobsOhio quickly created a strategy for the pandemic economy, leading to the launch of Ohio to Work . Designed for displaced workers, Ohio to Work offered skills assessments, career coaching, virtual career fairs, and connection with employers who had signed on to interview or hire workers from the program. Specifically, McKinsey helped JobsOhio develop a unique program for reskilling and upskilling for higher-tech jobs: JobsOhio paid for tuition costs for technical degrees, and enrollees gradually repaid JobsOhio through a marginal percentage of their income—if they got a job that paid a good wage. Those repaid funds are not kept by JobsOhio; instead, the organization invests them in the next cohort. The program has been a success. Its funds have continued to replenish because of the high employment rate of participants. “With this strategy, not only is Ohio coming back strong from COVID-19, but Ohioans have the opportunity to pursue new careers they might have never thought possible,” says Ben. “A woman who had been a back-office worker and lost her job is now a nurse assistant—a whole new, stable career that feels like a calling. There are many powerful stories like this.” As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years. Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Most recently, the decade of growth and economic investment in Ohio helped attract a new investment from Intel, which announced earlier this year that it would be opening a new chip manufacturing plant in Central Ohio . This huge project is the largest single private-sector company investment in the state. It will create 3,000 new jobs at the plant with an average salary of $135,000. “As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years,” says JP Nauseef , president & CEO of JobsOhio. “Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The turnaround of the state’s jobs growth, Ben adds, suggests a potential way forward for other challenging situations. “Their success has been a paradigm shift,” says Ben Safran. “They are a model for growth in a changing economy.” related Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story", "summary": "JobsOhio, formed in 2011 to revitalize Ohio's economy post-recession, has created nearly one million jobs through strategic partnerships and innovative programs like Ohio to Work.

They had come to learn what would happen when they cranked the big mill up to a work rate that had never been tried. The possibility of causing problems at the mill weighed on everyone’s mind. The team members had initially resisted the idea of running the mill faster. They wanted to keep the stockpile of ore that feeds the mill from dropping below the minimum size they had long maintained. Their concern was that a too-small stockpile would hamper the mill’s performance. Whether the minimum stockpile size actually helped the mill run better was another matter. No one really knew for sure. Nor could the mill’s managers and staff say what would happen if the stockpile shrank to less than the traditional minimum. As the weeks went by, the copper-ore concentrating mill sustained a faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. What they did know is that a custom-built artificial-intelligence (AI) model, loaded with three years’ worth of operating data from the mill and programmed to look for operational tweaks that would boost output, kept saying copper production would rise if the mill were fed with more ore per minute. To the mill operators, that notion sounded logical enough—except that it didn’t account for the minimum stockpile size they had in mind. But the model didn’t know, or care, about minimum stockpile size or any of the mill operators’ other ideas about how the mill ought to be run. With permission from company executives, the crew members at the Bagdad site decided to turn up the pace of the mill as the model had suggested. They also prepared to ramp up mining and crushing activities so the stockpile of ore wouldn’t run out. At ten o’clock in the morning, a technician clicked a control on his computer screen to speed up the system of conveyor belts carrying chunks of ore from the crusher to the stockpile and from the stockpile to the mill. Everyone in the room kept watch on the 13 oversize monitors in the control room, which were lit up with readings from hundreds of performance sensors placed around the mill. The quantity of ore grinding through the mill rose. No warnings went up. Twelve hours passed. The mill held steady. Even when its stockpile of ore dipped below the usual minimum, the accelerated delivery of ore from the crusher and the mine allowed the mill to keep going. As the weeks went by, the mill sustained the faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. “That was the breakthrough we’d been looking for,” Justin Cross, the Bagdad site’s general manager, told us. “Once we started to run the mill at full speed, we knew we could get results from more of the recommendations that the model was making.” The ‘age of the operator’ The story of how Freeport-McMoRan learned to rely on an AI model as much as the intuition of veteran mining engineers and metallurgists might not raise eyebrows outside the tech industry. For mining companies, though, it illustrates a quiet but profound shift into an era we think of as the “age of the operator,” when the best-run businesses wring profits out of low-grade ore that miners would have waved off as waste just ten years ago. One mine where Freeport-McMoRan had been processing declining ore grades is Bagdad, a sprawling Arizona complex where prospectors staked their first claims in 1882. Bagdad’s reserves of higher-grade ore have been depleted for some time, but Freeport-McMoRan has sustained the mine’s production of copper by making various process improvements. By the end of 2017, executives believed that Bagdad had gotten as efficient as it could get with its existing equipment, so they reasoned that adding capacity would be the surest way to get even more copper out of the site. Early in 2018, they started planning a $200 million capital expansion of Bagdad’s ore-concentrating mill that would lift production by 20 percent. Copper prices were high at the time. The investment looked certain to pay off. Then copper prices dropped from a five-year peak of around $3.30 per pound in early June to $2.75 or so a month later. All of a sudden, investing $200 million to expand Bagdad no longer seemed practical. Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase the site’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Instead, Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase Bagdad’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Discovering improvements at an efficient mine wouldn’t be easy. But Freeport-McMoRan had plenty of high-quality information to study. Around ten years before, Bert Odinet, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief information officer, coordinated an effort to standardize the way that each site measures and reports its performance and to build a central data warehouse for storing those measurements. Several years later, maintenance teams lobbied for the installation of additional network equipment and performance sensors on the company’s trucks, power shovels, and stationary machines. The teams would manually download data from those sensors to the data warehouse so they could further sharpen their maintenance practices and improve the functioning of equipment. When wireless mesh networks became cost effective and reliable, Freeport-McMoRan installed them at all its sites. Now the company could capture and correlate second-by-second performance readings in the data warehouse, all in real time. “We learned things we’d have never predicted,” Odinet said. “That project taught us to be more receptive to what the data was telling us. And it gave us the confidence to try more complicated analyses.” With advanced analytics and AI techniques , Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of data it collected, identify even more operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in the field. Bagdad looked like a good proving ground for this method. The site is staffed with creative, open-minded engineers, metallurgists, and equipment operators who stood out at Freeport-McMoRan for their willingness to try new things. Their earlier efforts to enhance Bagdad’s metallurgical processes, for example, had resulted in higher copper recovery. And Cross, Bagdad’s general manager, was a natural tinkerer who liked to spend his free time outfitting his pickup truck for off-road use and milling mesquite logs into lumber for a house he planned to build himself. Since joining Freeport-McMoRan in 2006, Cross had led a series of projects to streamline operations at the company’s mines. Would you like to learn more about McKinsey Analytics ? It also helped that Bagdad’s operations were stable. With few equipment problems or process hiccups to straighten out, workers would have time to help increase copper production. Executives felt that promising opportunities to boost Bagdad’s production could be found in one part of the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, a noisy facility where huge milling machines and flotation cells bubbling with chemical solutions turn grapefruit-size rocks containing around 0.4 percent copper into a fine-ground mix of 25 percent copper and 75 percent rock. The mill’s technicians ran the facility strictly by the book, a set of operating instructions that Freeport-McMoRan engineers in Phoenix had developed. There had to be ways of building on those instructions that would better the mill’s performance. After talking things over with engineers and operations specialists from Bagdad and from headquarters, Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson and CFO Kathleen Quirk decided to let the crew at Bagdad work with McKinsey on a new kind of mining project: data mining in an agile way. Learning agile The project called for more than sophisticated data science. It also called for a new approach to solving tricky operational problems. “Usually when we run operational projects, we overengineer them. We test every conceivable scenario, build in safeguards, and do everything we can to ensure that a process change will result in an improvement before we make it,” Cross observed. “It’s a dependable way to get good results. But it takes a huge amount of time, effort, and capital investment.” McKinsey’s consultants reckoned that the crew at Bagdad might get better results, more quickly, by carrying out the analytics project differently. They introduced the idea of working under agile principles , which emphasize quick development of functional solutions that teams then improve, little by little, according to feedback from users. The general manager assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. Another essential feature of agile methods is face-to-face collaboration within well-rounded teams . Cross assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. The composition of the team allowed it to tap the expertise and account for the interests of each division of Bagdad that its work might affect. It also enabled the team to contend better with challenges that involved different divisions and couldn’t be solved by one division alone. The team’s agile approach was to work in “sprints”—two-week bouts of activity in which the team conceived a data-modeling function or operational change, tested it, and learned what would make it better. As improvements came to light, the team would add them to a backlog. Then it would plow through the items on the backlog in subsequent sprints, starting with the easiest, most beneficial tasks. For Bagdad’s crew members, this agile style of working wasn’t just different from business as usual. It represented a radical departure from the way they’d been doing things. “It took us a while to get comfortable with agile,” Cross said. “We had to let go of a lot of old habits.” McKinsey brought in agile coaches to help. The coaches explained the rudiments of agile —building a backlog, deciding what to accomplish in each sprint, holding morning meetings to agree on the work the crew would perform each day and to note any difficulties that might slow it down—but were mainly there\nto join the team’s activities and teach its members to work together in agile ways. Shannon Lijek, a McKinsey partner who specializes in helping organizations apply agile methods, was one of the coaches who came to help the Bagdad team get the hang of agile. “We’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” said McKinsey partner Shannon Lijek. “Agile can be tricky to adopt at first because it isn’t a process you can memorize. It’s a set of principles for minimizing wasted effort and getting more work done. And we’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” Lijek said. One way that Bagdad’s agile team cut out needless effort was by introducing solutions as soon as it had built “minimum viable products,” or MVPs, that were good enough to use, rather than laboring to perfect those products first. “If we’d built the model ourselves, we’d have tried to get it 100 percent right before doing anything with it,” Cross told us. “Shannon and the McKinsey coaches encouraged us to work with solutions that weren’t finished. They’d say, ‘You can get 60 percent of the improvement with an MVP, and that’s a lot. So just start using it. Then you can worry about making it better.’” Introducing AI and agile to mining operations: Lessons from Bagdad By Red Conger Freeport-McMoRan’s effort to increase copper production at Bagdad taught us a good deal about how to use agile methods and AI tools at our sites, where it can be difficult to alter accepted routines. Here are a few things we’re keeping in mind as we expand the use of agile and AI to more of Freeport-McMoRan’s operations: Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan. From predicting to optimizing Once the team Cross formed came together, it began investigating the possibility of improving the mill’s performance. The idea was to spend a month examining data from the mill for patterns that revealed potential improvements. If those improvements looked promising enough, the team would pursue them. Beginning in late June, the Bagdad team and data scientists from McKinsey built a machine-learning model to check whether the mill truly ran as efficiently as people believed. The model, a type of extreme gradient-boosting model, consisted of an ensemble of thousands of decision trees that had been engineered to include a great deal of metallurgical knowledge. The staff at Bagdad and Freeport-McMoRan’s central operations group believed all the ore entering the mill was of the same type. Consequently, they had defined a single “recipe” of lower and upper parameters for the mill’s 42 control settings: the mix of differently sized ore chunks being fed into the mill, the pH level in the flotation cells, and so on. But when the agile team at Bagdad ran the data from the mill’s performance sensors through its model, the members of the team learned something new. From the mill’s perspective, the mine was actually producing seven distinct types of ore. What’s more, the mill’s standard recipe for control settings didn’t match the properties of all those ore types. Ore containing more iron pyrite, for example, would yield more copper if the pH level in the flotation cells were set higher than the recipe prescribed. “Thinking about ore clusters in terms of data from the mill’s instruments, rather than classifications from traditional geology, was a major mind-set shift—and it opened up many new possibilities for improving performance,” said Sean Buckley, a McKinsey partner who led the analytics work. All told, the team’s analysis suggested that adjusting the mill’s controls to suit each of the seven ore types could increase copper production by 10 percent or more. That prospect convinced Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders to let the agile team at Bagdad build an AI model that would look at the ore coming into the mill and suggest control settings to heighten production of copper from that ore. Change that Matters Team members wrote algorithms to discern the connections among the ore type, the operational readings from the plant’s sensors, the amount of ore running through the mill, and the amount of copper recovered. Next, they developed more algorithms to predict the plant’s performance based on measurements from the sensors. After several weeks of development sprints, the team members had raised the accuracy of the model’s performance predictions to 96 percent—high enough to know that the model was properly interpreting the data streaming in from the mill’s sensors and relating it to the mill’s control settings. To determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, staff decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. The team then turned its attention from predicting performance to improving it. Staff began by asking a simple question that no one had asked in some time: What measure of performance do we want to optimize? For years, the team at Bagdad had oriented its decisions and activities toward particular targets for copper production and operating cost. That approach made a certain kind of sense. It meant that Bagdad consistently generated profits. Now, to determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, the team decided to establish a new mandate— maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. Cross and Cory Stevens, Freeport-McMoRan’s vice president of operational improvement, knew that maximizing production could lessen Bagdad’s performance in other areas. The mill’s recovery rate—the percentage of copper extracted from the ore—might drop. Or the whole operation could come to a halt for hours. Stevens went to other executives to explain that Bagdad’s experiment could be costly. The performance numbers they’d see for the next few months might be dismal, he warned. Nonetheless, the executives agreed with Stevens that if Bagdad could achieve the 10 percent increase in production that the model predicted, the short-term cost would be worth it. They gave him the go-ahead to try maximizing production. With that approval, Cross granted Bagdad’s staff the latitude to make operational changes that deviated from standard procedures and could cause the mill to miss its performance targets. Worker safety and equipment integrity were the only areas where no compromises or experiments would be allowed. Any other changes were fair game. A big breakthrough Over a series of iterations during the next month or so, the team conceived, tested, and refined algorithms that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend control settings to maximize copper output. The new algorithms, known as genetic algorithms, used the principles of natural selection to “evolve” settings that would produce the most copper, given a particular type of ore. By early September, the team had expanded the prediction model into an MVP of an optimization model, dubbed TROI, that was capable of issuing recommendations every 12 hours, once for each of the mill’s two daily shifts. When each new set of recommendations came out, the engineers, equipment operators, and metallurgists on the team would huddle and decide what do to with them. TROI was a work in progress, so its earliest recommendations weren’t entirely reliable. At every shift, metallurgists from Freeport-McMoRan and from McKinsey would study the model’s recommendations and question whether they were credible. Then the metallurgists would take note of the problem recommendations so the agile team could look into them. Some recommendations led the team members to discover flaws in TROI’s logic, which they added to their backlog and corrected in subsequent development sprints. Others indicated that the underlying performance data were faulty and prompted the team to look for fixes. “TROI helps us to improve the quality of our instrumentation and highlights sensors that need attention,” said Frank Ochoa, one of Bagdad’s process-control and instrumentation engineers. Most challenging were the model’s recommendations to depart from the operational recipe that the staff at Bagdad had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Most challenging were the recommendations to depart from the operational recipe the staff had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Gradually, as the team fine-tuned TROI, its recommendations became more plausible, and the staff at Bagdad began following them. Yet many of those recommendations resulted in slim performance gains,\nif any. Mid-October arrived. The team was nowhere close to the 10 percent production boost it thought possible. Cross and Stevens decided it was time to act on a weighty recommendation that no one was especially eager to try: speeding the flow of ore from the mine and the crusher to the mill. Cross asked the mine operators to redline their activities—and reassured them that they wouldn’t be blamed for spending more money or triggering operational breakdowns. The mine operators ramped up blasting, even though they had to use more explosives. They queued up trucks to carry rocks to the crushing plant, in violation of a long-standing directive to keep trucks from standing idle. They choke-fed the giant crusher with run-of-mine, or unprocessed, ore to find out how much it could handle. Finally, on October 19, the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate. Right away, copper production jumped 5 percent. TROI had helped the team unlock a record level of performance. Small gains add up Having achieved a major performance gain, Bagdad’s agile team turned to enhancing the model’s ability to recommend mill-control settings that would increase copper production. The agile team reviewed the data model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day and kept working through a backlog of upgrades. Within several weeks, the team had refined the model to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. TROI could already identify which type of ore was running through the mill at any moment. In the next round of sprints, the team added functions to account for other incoming operational data. Each time TROI recommended a set of control settings, the metallurgists at the plant would consider the recommendations, choose which ones to accept, and pass them to shift supervisors and operators, who would adjust the mill’s controls accordingly. Letting the metallurgists decide which recommendations to follow helped the agile team learn more quickly. Occasionally, the metallurgists applied settings that looked questionable just to find out whether they would work. And when the metallurgists rejected the recommended settings, they typed notes into the model to explain their decisions. “TROI doesn’t always give fully accurate recommendations, but it provides a new perspective on how to manage the plant and challenges our assumptions,” said Lulu Raymond, a senior metallurgist at Bagdad. All the while, sensors gauged the mill’s performance. The model’s machine-learning algorithms recorded which settings improved performance and which ones didn’t, and whether the recommendations were helping. The agile team reviewed the model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day, added items to the backlog of upgrades it planned to make, and kept working on those upgrades. By early December, the team had refined TROI to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. It wasn’t long before the metallurgists and mill operators began trying to outsmart TROI. They would monitor the type of ore passing into the mill, anticipate the control settings that the model might suggest, and apply those settings before the model made its twice-daily recommendations (later increased to every three hours). This became a kind of competition: Who can run the mill better than TROI would? Most important, the mill’s production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bagdad’s throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day—10 percent more than the previous quarter—while its copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point and its operations became more stable (exhibit). The following quarter, copper production at Bagdad went up yet again. Those gains should lift Bagdad’s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200 million capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex. We think this is just the beginning for Freeport-McMoRan. Having learned to maintain TROI during the project, the company’s metallurgists and data scientists now run the model themselves, without ongoing support from McKinsey. They study daily and weekly reports that compare the mill’s performance with TROI’s predictions, and they continue enhancing the model’s ability to make recommendations. Freeport-McMoRan executives have also sponsored the creation of a second agile team at Bagdad to test and make process improvements at the mine. This team, too, is working without help from McKinsey, using the agile methods that it learned on the mill project. At another one of Freeport-McMoRan’s Arizona copper mines, Morenci, managers have kicked off an agile and analytics effort like Bagdad’s. And the company will soon launch its most ambitious program of this kind at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in Peru with five times the capacity of Bagdad. The age of the operator is here, and Freeport-McMoRan is adapting to it with agile methods and AI tools. Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan.

Practically overnight, for example, physical distancing and the need for contactless interaction have magnified the importance of digital within real estate. Pioneers in the industry have been exploring ways to diversify sources of revenue, pursuing new digitally-enabled business models and focusing on tenant experience. The pandemic has made clear that those that haven’t yet made such investments in underlying capabilities and infrastructure will need to catch up quickly. Leap by McKinsey “The future of real estate is no longer about delivering four walls to tenants,” says RXR CEO Scott Rechler . “Instead, it’s about creating a unique, personalized customer experience that fosters meaningful interactions, collaboration, productivity. Delivering this will require a unique combination of capabilities that seamlessly integrate across the physical and digital realms.” The joint Leap-RXR team has built products and services for residents that enhance their living experiences. One innovation is a new RXR app that is anchored around a resident experience officer. Designed, created, and launched by the team, the app allows residents to manage elements of their personal lives, like moving into an apartment, and use digitally-enabled concierge services for services like housekeeping and grocery delivery.

Superheating can be tricky to get right. Steel reaches more than 1600 degrees Celsius during superheating, and the ideal temperature range spans only 15 degrees. If the steel comes out too hot, the equipment operators must slow the casting step. If the steel isn’t hot enough, it can “freeze” before it has been cast, which compromises its quality. The frontline operators at the secondary-metallurgy station were used to running the superheating process based on past experiences. They would consider prompts from control systems, which were loaded with standard formulas, and then decide what set points to apply so the steel temperature would end up in the target range. Most of the time, they heated two of every three batches of steel into the optimal range. That “strike rate” allowed them to complete 25 “heats” per day, but it also left room for improvement. Bringing the strike rate up to 85 percent or so would result in 28 to 30 heats per day, enough to boost throughput by roughly 8 to 12 percent, or 600 to 900 daily tons. The opportunity stood out to the plant managers, who had been given a mandate to improve the plant’s performance with advanced analytics. In early 2017, they devised a plan for building analytics models that would help frontline operators get better results from the superheating process and several other activities. Data scientists from Tata Steel and McKinsey used historical information from the plant to build and “train” a superheating-optimization model, which would examine real-time operational data and recommend process set points conducive to a higher strike rate. In addition, managers arranged for some employees to receive classroom training in data science, data engineering, and other advanced-analytics disciplines. At first, the superheating model proposed settings that consistently improved the strike rate. But as the mix of steel orders from customers began to differ from the mix of orders recorded in the model’s training data, the model started to generate faulty recommendations—which frontline operators ceased to follow. Employees who had gone through the classroom training tried to fix the model but found the problems too complex to correct using the basic skills they’d learned. Similar difficulties arose with the models being used elsewhere in the plant. Despite the setback, managers had seen how the advanced-analytics models reduced costs and raised output. Managers also realized that classroom training alone would not prepare employees to sustain those performance improvements. They concluded that the company would need to further cultivate employees’ analytics skills and transform their way of working. Their insight paid off. By building these capabilities, the plant would raise its performance to world-class levels and earn acclaim from the World Economic Forum in July 2019 as one of 44 Lighthouse sites that are leading in the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. What worked and what didn’t: Lessons from Kalinganagar’s analytics program Focus on business improvements, not technology improvements. Kalinganagar expanded its use of analytics quickly by targeting performance gains and building tech solutions to achieve them, rather than looking at available technologies and thinking of how to apply them. Develop analytics talent, instead of outsourcing it. When Kalinganagar’s first-wave analytics models needed updating, the plant didn’t have in-house specialists to fix them. Hands-on training enabled the plant to cultivate the analytics talent that it needed to scale up. Scale analytics to make it a part of everyone’s way of working. Moving beyond pilot projects produced enough value to convince holdouts to embrace working with analytics. Adoption also increased as frontline employees worked with specialists to create the tools and as managers recognized employees’ success using them. Preparing for analytics, well ahead of its time Tata Steel’s multiyear effort to develop analytics capabilities at the Kalinganagar plant can be traced to a decision that executives made in 2005, when the plant was first being designed and built. Analytics technologies were then years away from becoming readily applicable to businesses. Nevertheless, Tata Steel’s executives considered whether they should outfit the plant with instruments and sensors to monitor equipment and processes. Their decision was less clear-cut than it would have been today—remote-sensing equipment is now affordable and advanced analytics has been broadly adopted . But some executives and managers foresaw that spending money on data-collection gear would prove worthwhile, even though it wasn’t yet clear how the data would be used. Amit Kumar Chatterjee, the plant’s then-head of electrical maintenance, was among those pushing to make the early investment—and even he acknowledged that at the time, the potential applications for advanced analytics were undefined. “We didn’t have in mind how we’d use the data, except maybe for autonomous process controls. We were living in the world of physical science, where experience and equations matter most. Data science was not even on the horizon,” said Chatterjee. Even the makers of the plant’s machinery resisted adding instrumentation. “Still, we believed we should put on the sensors at that stage because we felt it would be a lot harder later on, when the uses for the data were known.” By the mid-2010s, the leaders of the Kalinganagar plant began looking closely at what they could do with the data the plant’s sensors were collecting. In 2015, T. V. Narendran, the managing director of Tata Steel, set out a $1 billion cost-optimization goal and called on the heads of the company’s plants to map a path toward that goal. One way of boosting performance, he suggested, was to do more with digital technology. Advances in hardware and data science had made it easier for companies to take big data sets, uncover patterns, and make predictions that could help them attain performance improvements. Leaders at Kalinganagar launched their own investigation into how the plant might apply data science. In 2016, they traveled to Germany and visited technology start-ups and large established companies to get a close look at what data science could do. Early the following year, the plant’s leaders resolved to start an advanced-analytics program at Kalinganagar. Beginning the analytics transformation Senior managers at Kalinganagar decided to try advanced analytics on several pilot projects. During a two-day workshop, managers and operations specialists worked with McKinsey experts to identify ten possible uses for analytics and selected three to focus on—one of which involved the superheating process in the plant’s secondary-metallurgy station. Managers wanted to create an advanced-analytics model that could assess conditions in the plant and calculate how much heat to apply during superheating so that the steel would emerge in the target temperature range. The team working on the superheating model sought to discern which variables were the most important determinants of the steel’s final temperature, and thereby learn how operators could improve the strike rate. They pulled together two years’ worth of operational data that had been generated by sensors or recorded manually in logbooks. Data scientists wrote algorithms to make connections among key factors: measures of the condition of the steel as it reached the secondary-metallurgy station, equipment settings that operators would adjust during the superheating cycle, and other settings that couldn’t be adjusted during a cycle but could be altered over time (such as the maximum rate of oxygen flow, capped by the equipment already in place). Preliminary results from several pilot projects convinced leaders at Tata Steel Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort. They laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve critical performance indicators and believed that analytics could help. After two weeks, the team had built a model capable of predicting, with 75 percent accuracy, whether a group of set-point recommendations would cause the molten steel to reach the casting station in the desired temperature range. The other two pilot-project teams built models of similar reliability. Although none of the models had yet been put to the test on the plant floor, the preliminary results convinced leaders at Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort and create models that employees would actually use. In September 2017, leaders laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve the plant’s critical performance indicators—energy consumption, throughput, quality, and yield—and believed that analytics could help . They chose to carry over the work on the superheating model to the first full phase of the project. Together, the five areas had the potential to enhance margins by $10 million annually. Ramping up As operations teams and analytics specialists built the phase-one models, leaders at Kalinganagar sponsored an effort to begin training some 130 employees—which comprised one-quarter of the managerial staff—in analytics. With McKinsey, the plant set up an introductory analytics academy , installed a 15-member faculty, and created 50-hour curricula for five roles: digital champion, project owner, business translator, data scientist, and data engineer. Students performed simple practice exercises in line with the duties dictated by their roles. Although the models from the first phase worked well for a time, they started to falter as conditions in the plant deviated from the conditions that the models had been optimized for. The employees who had been through the academy tried to fix the models but could not do so using the basic techniques they’d learned by that point. And they had yet to work as apprentices on analytics projects, which would have given them hands-on experience retraining models. They simply needed more real-world exposure to analytics. Challenges also arose as frontline operators tried to start working with the models. Shailendra Rai, the chief of blast-furnace operations at Kalinganagar, recalled that operators never became comfortable with a model that had been created to help improve the stability of the blast furnace: “Most people spend 20 or 30 years learning how to operate a blast furnace. They thought that the model would be this magical solution. When the initial output from the model didn’t match their beliefs, they couldn’t understand why. They weren’t convinced it would work. The buy-in wasn’t there.” Supporting an analytics transformation: A leader’s view by Rajiv Kumar After the first phase of the analytics transformation at Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, I saw that managers needed to put more emphasis on developing the capabilities of the plant’s workforce. I also recognized that I should make the transformation a top priority. This kind of transformation succeeds when everyone buys in—and for buy-in to develop, leaders must show they’ve bought in, too. To signal the transformation’s importance, I announced that Kalinganagar wouldn’t undertake any other big initiatives until the plant had developed the capabilities to build and deploy analytics solutions on its own. Consistency and stability are important in steelmaking, so changing the way we do things can be hard. I knew that if everyone’s attention was divided between multiple change initiatives, the analytics transformation would be more likely to slow down or stall out. I also began holding “skip-level meetings” with junior members of our workforce who were being trained as analytics specialists or learning to use analytics in frontline jobs. The analytics work wasn’t easy, so I wanted to hear firsthand about it, just as I do when I walk around the plant and talk to equipment operators and technicians. Having a feel for how things are going on the plant floor is important. Then, in the second phase of the transformation, I required managers from the plant to give updates on the analytics projects they were working on. All my questions went to Tata Steel employees as well. It was another way to reinforce the idea that analytics is part of how our plant now operates. Rajiv Kumar is vice president of operations for Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Doubling down on capabilities The model-building exercise confirmed what leaders at Kalinganagar had expected: that analytics could deliver significant and valuable performance improvements. It also convinced leaders to make further investments in employees’ capabilities so they could sustain the performance improvements and take analytics into other areas . In mid-2018, leaders chose to initiate a second phase of the program in which analytics specialists and frontline operators would develop and implement models to aid their decisions and receive hands-on training in analytics, with McKinsey’s help. For the team building the superheating model, analytics specialists from Tata Steel took a refresher course in the skills they’d studied at the academy. Then they were assigned to perform certain development tasks—augmenting the user interface, simplifying the database, retraining the model, deploying new modeling techniques and approaches—in collaboration with experienced practitioners from McKinsey. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists were assigned to perform development tasks in collaboration with experienced practitioners. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists also spent extra time working with the employees who controlled the superheating process at the secondary-metallurgy station. They asked more questions about the process to fine-tune the model. Specialists watched the operators at work and talked with them about ways of making the model easier to use. Operators cited numerous difficulties, from faulty computer hardware to clunky user interfaces, that the analytics team helped resolve. The analytics team explained how they had developed the model and how it worked, because they wanted operators to trust its recommendations. “All the employees at Kalinganagar had been trained to make decisions based on their experience. When problems happened, they would try to solve them with physical equations—put in raw materials and heat, get a certain output. They do look at data. But with data science, they can connect many more data points than we can with physical science. Even if they don’t have a physical equation to explain why something is happening, they can still figure it out with data. That was a new belief system that had to be built up,” said Chatterjee. After around six months, the superheating squad had built a model capable of recommending process set points that would raise the superheating strike rate to 90 percent. Now it was time for frontline operators to begin using the model on a regular basis. Managers kept track of who used the model and who didn’t and celebrated the accomplishments of the most devoted users. Employees went from following 60 percent of the model’s recommendations to following 85 percent in a couple of months. Taking analytics to scale When the second phase concluded, the plant’s leadership raised the bar once more. They called for a third phase, in which Tata Steel employees would select, lead, and deliver analytics projects related to each of the plant’s main areas: core processes, power, and utilities. McKinsey consultants would move into coaching roles on the employee-led project teams. To focus their efforts, these teams set improvement goals for more than 25 performance indicators, such as the daily tonnage of pig iron produced by the plant’s blast furnace. Because several of those indicators pertained to the superheating process, it again emerged as a priority for analytics work. The plant’s analytics specialists had learned enough about data science by then to take charge of the superheating model. They narrowed its target temperature range. They also added the ability to predict how much cooling would take place between the secondary-metallurgy station and the casting station. This helped operators manage the transfer better and increase throughput. Frontline operators followed the model’s recommendations even more closely. As a result, the superheating model produced the annual cost savings of $4 million that had been estimated at the outset of the analytics program. Comparable gains accrued elsewhere in the plant. For each of the 25-plus performance indicators, teams realized at least 80 percent of the targeted improvements. Their efforts yielded $70 million to $80 million of value and two to three percentage points of EBITDA 1 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. uplift. And in July 2019, the World Economic Forum announced that an independent panel of experts in the Fourth Industrial Revolution had recognized the Kalinganagar plant’s digital achievements as leading edge and named it a Lighthouse facility —making it the first such plant in India. Looking ahead The Kalinganagar plant now has a cohort of more than 30 analytics specialists, including data scientists and translators. The most experienced have become in-house instructors and coaches and are responsible for helping other colleagues learn new skills in data science, business-case development, and other key domains. With analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support. Analytics knowledge has also suffused the plant’s day-to-day work, changing the way that many employees solve problems. As Shailendra Rai, the head of blast-furnace operations, said, “If you talk to five blast furnace operators, they will have five different opinions about how to solve a problem. In a way, all five are correct—everyone’s speaking based on their own experience. But with analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support.” With these capabilities, managers have drawn up a slate of more than 20 additional use cases, and they are reinforcing the use of analytics where it’s already in place. For Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, analytics has become more than a tool for answering questions—it’s an integral part of the plant’s operations and culture.

When the 36th edition began in early March, the race’s defending champion, Emirates Team New Zealand, hit the water having utilized a new crewmember: an AI bot created by McKinsey. It turned out to be a winning combination. On March 17, the Kiwis successfully defended their title against the Italian challengers, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, winning their fourth America’s Cup. The America’s Cup has always been as much about technology and innovation as it is about sailing. Boat designs are governed by the competition’s “ Class Rule , ” which leaves small opportunities for design tweaks that might give one team an advantage over another. If brilliantly seized, those opportunities can translate into a shining race-day performance. Our goal was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. The Class Rule for this year’s race, published in March 2018, required the two competing teams to sail a 75-foot vessel. It’s not your typical sailboat. Hydrofoils fixed to the hull lift the entire craft out of the water, enabling it to reach speeds exceeding 60 mph, or 100 kph. Most importantly, the hydrofoils are one part of the boat where the Class Rule allowed for design modifications, which offered huge competitive advantages for the teams that got those modifications right. Doing so, according to McKinsey senior partner Brian Fox, required intensive testing—and lots of it. “Every boat in the America’s Cup is designed with a computer simulator,” says Brian, who sails competitively. “Whichever team has the best simulator, and uses it most effectively, gains the advantage.” In 2019, Emirates Team New Zealand partnered with McKinsey to begin an innovative project seeking that advantage. What they needed, they soon realized, was a new kind of crew member that could sail thousands of boats at a time. The answer to that call was an AI bot, or software robot, that could test new hydrofoil designs by sailing them on Emirates Team New Zealand’s simulator. Creating value beyond the hype The simulator had been key to the team’s victory in 2017; the sailors had used it to test new boat designs without having to actually build them. But that simulator required multiple team members using it simultaneously for it to work properly. This was a logistical challenge, given the sailors’ scheduled practices, travel, and competitions. “Our goal,” Brian explains, “was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. By developing an AI bot that could run the simulator by itself, we no longer had to manage around the sailors’ limited availability.” As a first step, the McKinsey team, which included colleagues from our analytics firm QuantumBlack , turned to the cloud. Over six-weeks, data, analytics, and machine-learning experts from Sydney, Melbourne, and London migrated New Zealand’s simulator and developed an infrastructure to run it in the cloud. Then our team used a new and innovative approach called deep reinforcement learning to essentially teach the AI bot how to become a professional sailor. The technique allowed the bot to learn dynamically and gain greater accuracy through continuous feedback. Nic Hohn , one of the key project leaders, explains. “When you start, the AI agent knows nothing and learns by trial and error using countless variables—wind speed, direction, adjustments to the 14 different sail and boat controls—and is refined again and again,” Nic says. “Since the bot keeps experimenting, if you coach it to learn in the right way, it compresses into hours what would take a human years to understand.” This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat. The work was highly technical, according to QuantumBlack’s chief scientist Jacomo Corbo, and it required  extensive innovation around the bot’s learning program. “At this point in the project, a lot of creative thinking had to be done to figure out the right learning models, how best to coach the bot, and the right guard rails and rewards to put into place.” The team also created a network that allowed multiple bots to share information as they each learned to sail. This was a critical breakthrough, as it allowed the individual bots to gain knowledge from their collective experience. Ultimately, there were a thousand bots running in parallel, learning from each other. “It's learning at a huge scale and it dramatically reduces the time and cost of the project,” says Nic. “That's the power of the cloud.” Within two weeks, the bot was sailing in a straight line, upwind and downwind. After mastering the basics, it graduated to more complex sailing maneuvers. The turning point came about eight weeks later, when the AI bot started beating the sailors in the simulator. At this point, the bot became the ideal way to test variations of the hydrofoils; it was more consistent and more scalable than the sailors, speeding the cycles of design iterations dramatically. “This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat,” observes Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and member of the QuantumBlack leadership team in Europe, who is also a world champion sailor. Soon, the sailors were learning maneuvers from the bot. “With such a steep development curve, accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable,” explains Oliver Fleming , an expert associate partner, “both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, the bot sped New Zealand’s design process by a factor of ten. The race’s outcome proves that reinforcement learning can be a transformational tool for process design, with potential applications across industries. “This has been one of the most complex deployments of deep reinforcement learning in the public cloud,” says Jacomo. “One way to think about the difficulty of the problem: game-tree complexity roughly tallies the size of the space one has to navigate while accounting for the set of possible game paths, or the sequence of decisions, that need to be taken. Go , which is an extremely complex board game, has a game-tree complexity of 170—our sailing problem has a game-tree complexity of nearly 2900.” Mastering such technical complexity, particularly in this application, has heightened this project’s excitement for everyone involved. “It is thrilling to be using technology and AI to master the wind and water and go as fast as you possibly can,” says Nic. “This is not sailing as we know it—it's much closer to flying a low-altitude aircraft.” To learn more about our work in AI, visit QuantumBlack .

Built by Facebook with help from Google, the cables could boost data capacity to southeast Asia’s largest economy by 70 percent. The project, which is still subject to government approval, would be a boon to Indonesia’s connected users, who are among the savviest in the region and beyond. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Today, the nation comprises the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in the world. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Telkomsel has been an engine of that growth. The world’s seventh-largest mobile operator and the largest in Southeast Asia, the mobile-communications provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable, inclusive digital economy for Indonesia’s nearly 200 million internet users. It has dramatically increased Indonesia’s broadband access, helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) digitize, and led the nation’s transition from 3G to 4G before becoming the first operator to launch 5G there in May 2021. Telkomsel has long recognized the value of continuous innovation. When it looked to ensure its platform would remain the primary way its customers engage with the world—and win a new generation of customers—the 26-year-old incumbent decided to embark on a big, bold transformation. A plan to transform The move wouldn’t be easy, but Telkomsel felt it had an obligation to its customers, who had come to rely on the provider’s ability to meet their digital demands. So the organization called on a cross-functional team of data-domain experts from QuantumBlack and venture builders, designers, and strategy consultants from Leap by McKinsey to initiate a large-scale digital program aimed at reinventing the way customers experience Telkomsel in daily life. As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel knew it had to engage and strengthen its relevance with Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer segment. The average data-hungry Gen Z consumer in Indonesia spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone, using it to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. The program was built on three core pillars. Telkomsel wanted to build a new data analytics platform to better understand its customers and drive personalization; create and launch new businesses to reach underserved consumers; and launch a new digital channel that would streamline and simplify the way customers engage with Telkomsel’s services. Understanding customers Telkomsel’s leaders knew that providing customers with the best products and services would require putting data to smart use. The company developed new analytics capabilities that allowed it to enhance customers’ experiences and start the journey toward hyper-personalizing its services. Telkomsel began by building a new platform that contains more than 9,000 data points for each consumer, which was fully modular and reusable across business units. This gave the company a single, near-real-time view of customer behavior that could be used to improve experience across the entire consumer journey, from marketing and customer service to network operations, back-office support, and more. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. They also moved from manual data uploads to automated data pipelines and quality checks, which improved data quality and speed, and enabled more accurate and faster decision-making. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. Every month, Telkomsel runs more than 50 analytical models, based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, to identify the right way to interact with their customers and offer them propositions that are most relevant to them. The move toward hyper-personalization has allowed Telkomsel to better tailor their offers for customers. Today, these services and offerings already account for 50 percent of the telco’s overall revenues. Creating value beyond the hype Launching new businesses As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel moved to engage and strengthen its relevance with new consumer segments. For instance, the company needed to enhance its relevance to those underserved by traditional home broadband infrastructure. They also wanted to reach Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer audience, which spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. In order to move at their desired speed, Telkomsel would need to launch new brands and value propositions, which would require them to embrace a different culture, agile ways of working, and a fit-for-purpose technological stack through new business-building. In the end, they launched two new brands. Orbit: Expanding connectivity for underserved segments Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. Even as Indonesia rapidly digitized, fixed broadband access was not uniform, with just 15 percent of households using it to get online. To provide wireless connectivity to those who lacked fixed broadband, Telkomsel built and launched a new business called Orbit, which provides customers with a home router that uses 4G mobile cellular services instead of fiber optics. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. It includes a mobile app to check usage, top up on data, and manage router settings, such as parental controls. Orbit has doubled its one-year customer acquisition goal, with more than 35 percent of customers joining from its referral program, a testament to its popularity and market demand. Today, Orbit is seeing 20 percent month-over-month growth. By.U: Reaching Generation Z Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. Telkomsel didn’t have the kind of brand association among the digital natives it wanted to serve and delight. A cross-functional team of product managers, customer design experts and venture builders developed, built, and launched by.U, an all-digital telco experience. The platform allows users to select a pre-paid SIM card that arrives at their doorstep, activate their number remotely, manage top-ups and quotas, make payments, and more. By.U was built at pace. The team created a series of social-media tests to observe click-through rates on certain features, which allowed the team to develop and tune the minimum-viable product quickly. When Telkomsel beta-launched the brand, they quickly had 30,000 customers join the waitlist. The brand reached its one-year customer acquisition goal in half that time. Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. And to help ensure innovation continued post-launch, the by.U team established an agile-organization structure. Simplifying and enhancing engagement The app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. The goal of Telkomsel’s third pillar could be simply stated: to make customers’ interactions with the company as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible. But it was complicated to achieve. Telkomsel already had a self-serve mobile app, and the team initially set out to make changes there to improve the customer journey. However, as customer expectations for what an app could do rose—digital payments and loyalty programs, for example—so did pressure on the app’s infrastructure. It soon became clear that there was more value to be had in starting fresh. Delivering a new app is always complex. In this case, a core technology transition to a micro-services-based architecture proved to be the unlock. It also meant shaping a rigorous product-development strategy and creating a new commercial strategy to encourage uptake. But it was all worth it. With the launch of the award-winning MyTelkomsel, the company was able to offer customers more transparency around their usage, going from SMS-triggered alerts to an immediate, real-time view, as well as provide personalized packages tailored to their needs. Customer experience around digital payments became seamless, while an ecosystem with digital-retail partners let Telkomsel customers redeem loyalty points for products. Elsewhere, gamification mechanics allowed customers to earn badges that qualified them for free data allowances. The app also enabled access to new digital services, including video and gaming, and easier access to e-payment options through services like LinkAja, GoPay, OVO, Dana, and ShopeePay. All of this meant serving customers in more dynamic, exciting, and tailored ways. Today the app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. All aboard: Recruiting digital talent to sustain innovation Telkomsel knew that technology was only one part of the transformation equation. Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform—no matter how powerful—would perform to potential or withstand technological evolution. They also saw the potential in this partnership to help cultivate digital skills in Indonesia’s workforce, strengthening a commitment to building a center of excellence for Indonesian digital talent. They launched a new, agile recruitment process to attract, onboard, and train 40+ of Indonesia’s strong digital talent across data science, software engineering, product ownership and UX design. This entailed a whole new talent management approach – reinventing employer branding, carving out career paths for new profiles like data engineers and translators, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling existing analytics professionals. Over the course of several months, Telkomsel hired candidates across 12 newly created digital and data analytics roles, and set up seven cross-functional agile squads to catalyze the adoption of new ways of working. The end-product was a data management platform and new businesses - made in Indonesia, for Indonesians, by Indonesians. Culture, capabilities, and resilience Inside the company, its most enduring returns may also be among its least tangible: An emerging culture of innovation and agility; new capabilities and competencies; a new confidence in taking bold leaps through new ventures; and a commitment to long-term, sustainable transformation. Such traits, for example, enabled Telkomsel to help its customers through COVID-19. They quickly ensured their customers had fully-remote, digital services at their fingertips, and they were able to offer new packages that were tailored to what their customers needed and could afford at any given time. The telco industry is essential to our modern economies, enabling nearly every facet of remote connectivity, from online meetings to e-commerce to telehealth. It’s a sector in which it can feel like there’s little room for failure—and perhaps not always enough room for innovation. Telkomsel’s story is proof that innovation is not just valuable but critical; and that it can pay off when an organization commits to transformation at every level. Its digital journey has touched the lives of hundreds of millions of Indonesians, through personalization at-scale to enhance the experience of all its customers, new brands tailored to its digital-first users, and a new app that adds convenience to customers’ daily lives.

Welders spend long hours on their feet and often work outside: on bridges, at race tracks, in oil fields, and other sites. Welding strains eyesight, the neck, and shoulders. Fumes are toxic and burns common. For 40 years, our Sweden-based design team has collaborated first with Speedglas and then with 3M to design, and continually improve, welding helmets. With every product cycle, the joint team started from scratch, reimagining and redesigning the helmets, with innovations that sometimes shifted the entire industry. Our partnership has helped to improve welders’ safety and comfort under dangerous and strenuous working conditions. It started in 1983 when a tiny company called Speedglas invented a new type of welding glass. It darkened automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc, freeing welders from having to constantly “nod” the shield up and down as they worked. Other innovations over the years included a device that pivots the shield up and back over the crown of the head, rather than resting at the forehead, easing neck pain. Internal padding that skirted pressure points, reducing headaches. A two-way fan system that improved breathability. A textile covering that captured stray glass crystals. A curved design for glass that extended peripheral vision. Our partnership has produced seven signature helmet designs, with accessories, which have won 11 international awards, including a 2021 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award , and are now sold in 60+ countries. But most importantly, our work together has helped to protect welders around the world . Our North Star How do you sustain a 40-year partnership and reinvent the same product in fresh, new ways, again and again? “From our first contact in the mid-80s, we realized that if we worked together we could do something exceptional for our end users: the welders,” reflects Anders Grönberg , the global portfolio leader of welding at 3M. An engineer and market economist by training, Anders has led the development of the helmets for 25+ years, since joining Speedglas in 1990, and then moving on to 3M when it bought the company in 2004. “This has been our common interest during all these years: That we fulfill their needs today and in the future. The fact that we have been successful has, of course, also strengthened the relationship.” When Speedglas was first invented, industries in Sweden were advanced when it came to personal protective equipment. “Organizations were very keen to take care of their users,” recalls Anders. “We got a lot of suggestions and improvements from welders. We took notes with paper and pen and would go back to the office, share the information, and it would grow from there.” “Our North Star has always been to do the research where the welders are most comfortable: at his or her welding bench,” explains Oskar Juhlin , a McKinsey Design alumnus who led the helmet design work from 1983 to 2019. “If you bring someone into a design workshop, office, or other synthetic area, they won’t be as straightforward as they would be in their own environment. We also welded in our own studios, so we could test out the designs ourselves .” Design matters We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design. Early on, it was a challenge to talk to welders about design; at the time it was typically understood to be a field concerned with aesthetics alone. “One guy told me ‘I don’t care about how it looks, as long as I like it,’” he remembers. “Many welders work on race cars. Well it was a different story when I said, ‘So it doesn’t matter what wheels you put on your car?’ Yes, it does! So, then design is important? We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design.” Over time, the customer base grew to include countries in Asia and the US, where customers were very interested in the helmet technologies and had ideas for improvements. “There were more regulatory requirements to fulfil, so user research expanded into a more formal system,” recalls Anders. “We also realized we had to look beyond the current moment and anticipate the welders’ future needs.” Today, a product road map guides the design planning from three to five years out, with the goal of introducing a new helmet model every two years. “The cycles are getting shorter as the technology is changing more quickly,” says Anders. How we work The typical product cycle begins with the R&D team at 3M presenting the newest technical capabilities to three our four McKinsey industrial designers.  Many have worked together for years. The designers will have a wish list of what they’d like it to look like, as well as new materials, textiles, and fabrics to consider. “You design the helmet with several design concepts, on paper, in computer, foam and clay models, exploring different shapes and trying out materials,” explains Emelie Hedén Edlund , a design director who specializes in color, materials, and finish —or CMF, as it’s known— and worked on the later models. “You touch it, feel it, and then you go back to the computer again. There is a lot of back-and-forth between digital and physical hands-on testing.” The design studio is located in a large converted missionary church in Stockholm, with workshops for sewing, foam and wood working, metal working, and welding. As the design phase unfolds, the joint teams meet in a series of workshops, sitting together for one or two days testing out new prototypes, splitting up to work separately and do homework, and then coming back together to validate new iterations. Then they go to the welders to try out the prototypes and confirm they are moving in the right direction. If so, they go on to the next stage: the critical step of ensuring that the helmet model can be manufactured in high volumes . Hans Nyström , associate design director at McKinsey, recalls one inspiring meeting. “The extended 3M team and our designers were at the table, discussing a very complicated prototype. And it was clear that it weighed too much. No one wanted to raise their hand and say ‘it’s my work that’s causing this.’”  On the spur of the moment, the McKinsey team proposed a workshop: to get tools and drills out, then and there, and find ways to cut the weight. Together the entire team looked at every component—drill a hole here, nip away material there. They lost ounces. “From that experience, we all saw a better way of working. By sharing the common goal, it changed the whole mindset of the team,” Emelie said. “It doesn’t feel like a client relationship, but like a partnership.” “It feels good to work with a partner who has so much trust,” says Hans. “3M has an appreciation of good design—we share that as a starting point. We complement each other skill-wise. They have the deep technical and mechanical expertise while we focus on the design and exterior surfaces. We are on the same software systems, so it’s a seamless integrated workflow. Together we share a wealth of knowledge.” Giving emotional resonance to a functional object Over the years, our designers have drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources including medieval knights, superheroes, ergonomics, and Chinese acupressure. But for many, the helmet model closest to their hearts is the 9000 launched in 1996. It was the first time user research had been incorporated into every step, and it was a major departure in design. The shape of the helmet morphed from a square mailbox into a mask that felt more like a natural extension of the wearer’s face. “The design team had a lot of discussions with the welders about the emotional aspects or character we wanted to express,” explains Hans. “It had to be very professional, powerful. Welders are very proud of their work–just think of the image of Rosie the Riveter, who was a welder. This was the heritage of the profession. If it were in a movie, the helmet would have to be fit for a hero knight on a black dragon.” Designers introduced a ridge down the middle of the helmet face to suggest the look of armor and expressed trust through open forehead lines and other facial nuances. The ‘line of sight’ is angled downward, focused on the hands—the work. This model also incorporated the ability to exhale through side vents. “At the time, they were actually put on mannequins in the windows of one of Stockholm’s finest department stores as a fashion item because they looked so cool,” recalls Emelie. “They went from being a very functional object to having an emotional element.” The helmet would be cited as an example of ‘futuristic’ design for the next ten years. After it was launched in 1996, the strikingly futuristic 3M Speedglas 9000 helmet was displayed on mannequins in the department store Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm. Breathing easier Three years later, the team introduced the Speedglas Adflo, an air-purifying respirator that circulated air to reduce heat and improve breathability. It was a fan attachment that fit snugly down the welder’s body, fastened with a belt at the waist. This tight profile reduced the risk of the welder getting snagged on the equipment. “It was a revolutionary change,” said Oskar. “All of the other fans on the market had a round filter attached to the back which looked like a mushroom. By 2014, we went to a trade show, and every fan on market had this tight, streamlined look—our design had moved the market.” Last year, 3M launched the G5-02 for highly precise TIG welding. The helmet holds the world’s first curved glass shield, a design that follows the shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This year, it won the Red Dot award with a Best of the Best distinction. Looking ahead, Oskar predicts: “The helmets will become almost like a second skin, with softer, high-tech materials rather than hard plastic which is bulky, uncomfortable, noisy. Shields are already connected to blue tooth so you can maneuver equipment with a phone; there will be developments with cameras and video, and radar may be used for detecting the target, rather than light.” The evening news While the awards and external praise are gratifying, some of the most satisfying recognition has come from welders themselves. “We have had many, many stories, but there are a couple that are more famous within 3M,” Anders says. “We had a welder here in Sweden who we were visiting at his work site. We had just introduced the respiratory protection together with the helmet. After a moment’s thought, he said that he liked the helmet now because he could actually watch the late news on television. Before he began using the respirator, he was so tired that he would fall asleep before the news had started. That was an indication to us that the product that we had supplied to the market was actually helping to improve our users’ quality of life. It is a huge motivation for all of the people in our company to continue working with this kind of product.” For Oskar, the ultimate recognition came with the futuristic 9100 series. “Some welders tattooed themselves with images of that shield,” says Oskar. “That says something about our design.” Related Practices Design | Operations | Technology Related Articles How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger How award-winning design is helping older adults live safely and with dignity at home", "summary": "For 40 years, 3M and Speedglas have collaborated to innovate welding helmets, enhancing safety and comfort for welders.

There appeared to be no solution. The complexity of the devices, whose supply chains comprise hundreds of specialized manufacturers scattered across the globe, made production surges seemingly impossible. “Italy wanted to order 4,000,” a European manufacturer told the paper, “but there’s not a chance.” Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, an effort was underway that would unite a group of optimists and problem solvers from Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, McKinsey, and an array of Vyaire’s suppliers. Together, they embarked on an ambitious quest to dramatically increase ventilator production, thereby giving medical professionals a chance to better care for critically ill patients. Before it was all said and done, the venture would put thousands of furloughed people back to work, stand up a new ventilator-manufacturing facility, and bolster links in far-flung supply chains on the way to hitting a production rate that would deliver nearly a years’ worth of ventilators every three days . “At Vyaire, we take pride in accepting and facing challenges that others might shy away from,” says Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal. “In this case, we achieved something others might not dare to imagine.” Beyond business as usual The history of mechanical ventilation goes back hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until the polio epidemics of the early 20th century that the devices were widely used. Among the most well-known was the Drinker respirator, or “iron lung,” which looked like a mini submarine and was powered by vacuum-cleaner motors. They’ve come a long way since then. Today, these devices are the size of a large briefcase and utilize multiple circuit boards, complex software, and hundreds of components to control things like air pressure, flow rate, oxygen level, humidity, and temperature. Their engineering has more in common with aerospace systems than with household appliances. Ventilators are much scarcer than either of those things, however, and the outbreak of COVID-19 introduced a vast and widening gulf between supply and demand. In April of 2020, for instance, a McKinsey team looking at global medical supplies estimated that there were about 23 ventilators per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the most plentiful supply. “In Africa,” says Miyu Toyoshima Galliart, a McKinsey associate partner, “the region with the lowest supply according to the analysis, the estimate was fewer than one [ventilator] per 100,000 people.” Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth “To call this extraordinary-demand scenario ‘unprecedented’ would be a gross understatement,” says McKinsey partner Ron Ritter, who helped lead the effort. “Nothing about ventilators—their supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, service, or support—was ever designed for anything like what happened with COVID-19.” Typical ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day. Vyaire’s production team suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Of course, Vyaire’s operations were built for typical demand—not the increased needs of a pandemic. Its usual ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day, which is a lot considering the complexity, quality-control requirements, and capital-asset value. (By comparison, the highest-demand commercial aircraft in modern history never once exceeded a production rate of 60 per month. While different in many ways, both are highly engineered capital assets.) In April of 2020, Vyaire’s main ventilator product line suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Making that number would require a ramp in production toward 700 units a day in a matter of weeks. “Our executive team heard the concern in the voices of colleagues in the field, who were speaking with clinicians and providers across the world,” says Tammy Noll, senior vice president and general manager of Vyaire’s ventilation franchise. “We knew immediately no amount of business-as-usual was going to work.” So, the company got to work on business-as- unusual . The first step was to maximize output at Vyaire’s Palm Springs, California plant. Joined by industrial engineers from a major auto manufacturer in North America, Vyaire and McKinsey teams worked to revalidate basic manufacturing numbers, dial-in labor, and machinery capacity. Stopwatches and toolboxes in hand, these experts did everything they could—timed process cycles, analyzed bottlenecks, reviewed floor layouts, tweaked machines, and more—to get the most out of the capacity they had at hand. “We started with a spreadsheet,” says Bhavuk Tandon, a McKinsey associate and member of the team walking the factory floor, “and we were conducting time studies on the floor, going through every cell, understanding all the lines and how they worked. We needed that information to help us understand what we had to do to build a facility that [would] give 30 times and more—fast.” Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations. The practice, Ron says, can be an effective first step during critical shortages. “Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations,” he explains. “Finding it normally produces a 20 to 30 percent boost in output right away.” Once the analysis was complete, Vyaire added shifts to the reoptimized line. The moves helped increase production by about threefold. It was a huge leap by industry standards, but well short of what it would take to begin meeting demand. To get there, the company would need to make an even bigger move—to the American heartland. An interview with Vyaire Medical CEO Gaurav Agarwal A new workforce, a new building With its Palm Springs plant running as hard as it could—yet still falling behind demand—Vyaire leaders began working hard to find more workers. “This was about finding an entire second workforce,” says David Marchand, now a McKinsey alum, who helped lead the project. “In a single product line, we needed an estimated 800 people: front-line operators, supervisors, process engineers, maintenance techs, security guards, department leads, site executives, warehouse staff, shipping departments, buyers—and they needed to know how to perform extremely well together, right away.” When needed immediately, a workforce like that can’t be hired incrementally. The only way to acquire one was to locate an intact team—which came from Spirit AeroSystems. The aerospace and medical-device industries may seem like strange bedfellows, but Spirit was the right partner for several reasons. Operationally, their people know industrialization, have high production standards, and operate complex supply chains. And in this case, given COVID-19’s impact on air travel, the company had people who were furloughed and more than ready to get back to work. We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world. This was clearly an international-security-level situation. But beyond that, it was Spirit’s culture that made them the perfect fit. According to Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile, “Spirit cultivates a ‘can be done,’ mission-oriented culture that has been built on accepting challenges.” This challenge tapped the company’s core values of transparency, collaboration, and inspiration, and it inspired the combined workforce of over 1000 employees. “We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world,” says Tom. “This was clearly an international-security-level situation.” To get the most out of this workforce, Vyaire looked beyond California in search of more production capacity. They found it 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, where Vyaire decided to open an additional ventilator plant. That may be easy to imagine, but it was hard to execute. Beyond a suitable 55,000 square-foot building, it took machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, quality control, assembly, testing facilities, and much more. Capacities for each manufacturing-process step had to be calculated. Several miles of copper, medical-grade oxygen gas-flow lines, electrical drops, and industrial-grade air compressors had to be installed. Data connectivity to handle huge test-protocol transactions with cloud-based legacy software needed to be set. Workstations, production tooling, and a range of fixtures had to be built or sourced and calibrated. Even basics like car parking for 200-person shifts, break rooms, badging, security, and fire-control had to be installed. Most critically, Vyaire and Spirit had to design and build workforce COVID-19 safety, including social-distancing fixtures, temperature screening, reporting, and testing protocols. “We were hyper focused on providing a safe environment for every single person who was about to work in that building,” says Noll. “We also knew the risk of outbreak in this facility carried added weight. Not only were we concerned about their health and that of their families, but we were also cognizant that the consequences of illness there would be felt by patients in need of these devices across the globe.” Vyaire and Spirit were now ready to chase a benchmark that, months prior, would’ve only existed in a company’s wildest dreams. All they needed now were enough parts to make it a reality. Supply-chain reaction Supply-chain operations make and deliver tangible aspects of our lives and create the fundamental material pathways in a functioning society. Unappreciated in normal times, they rush to the forefront in times of crisis, such as the great wars and most recently, COVID-19. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. During COVID-19, these suppliers were just as pressed as Vyaire. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. Much of their supply-chain expense sits among fasteners, precision-machined valves, resin-molded components, electronic circuits, batteries, and more. During COVID-19, the plants that manufacture these components were just as pressed as Vyaire. Versions of the same efficiency processes happening in Palm Springs and Wichita unfolded in hundreds of operations across the ventilator supply chain. The effectiveness of these moves was critical to boosting output, but they were harder for Vyaire to control. The suppliers medical-device manufacturers use were scattered globally. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they were often hit by competing demands. For example, an electronics manufacturer that makes medical-device circuit boards could see a wave of demand for virtual-work devices. Suppliers did their best to respond. Many found ways to ramp-up quickly and help get Vyaire and Spirit what they needed. Others lost adjacent demand and had capacity to spare. But in some cases, suppliers lost capacity or had exceedingly long lead times. The most critical of these situations—the ones whose projected output would limit the team’s target rate—were placed on a “red list.” Early on, the red list was long. “It was apparent that dozens of material sources might hold us back,” says Jenna Stauffer, a McKinsey engagement manager who worked on supply chains in the effort. Clearing the red list would require advanced intervention. A group comprising Vyaire’s most experienced buyers and manufacturing experts worked directly with suppliers to get specific information on process flows, bottleneck constraints, shipping delays, and the company’s own component constraints. In most cases, these interventions worked. But in extreme cases, teams cleared to travel during COVID-19 lockdown conditions worked directly with vendors on site. In one example, a European producer of pressure transducers emerged as a key constraint. Teams traveled to the plant, mapped the entire process flow, and installed IoT sensors on a key rate-determining step in a single day. The work provided live, digital tracking of actual production against the max potential rate, and it helped the site raise its output within 48 hours. The red list work was among the most relentless of the entire effort. It went on around the clock daily, as time zones rolled through the global night, demanding nonstop problem solving for months. The impossible made possible—by people If machines and technology were this effort’s arms and legs, people—many of whom have never met in person to this day—were its head and heart. They were united through a relentless drive to help, a product of the cultures at both Vyaire and Spirit, and they had the skills necessary to do so. “Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring,” says Catherine-Sophie Haigh, a McKinsey operations specialist who worked on the project. “Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity, and they trusted the teammate by their side—in many cases by their ‘virtual’ side.” Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring. Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity. This was especially evident around one of the initiative’s most critical moments. When it became clear that the Palm Springs plant would never have the capacity to hit rising target rates, and splitting focus between it and the Wichita plant was sapping energy, leaders decided to execute what became known as “lift and shift” to consolidate the entire operation under a single roof. This meant shutting down the key ventilator production lines in the California plant over a weekend, crating all production equipment, and moving it as quickly and safely as possible to Kansas. Given the stakes, the risk of losing equipment in transit, having it not restart, or suffering irreparable damage was frightening. “I’d done something like this on a smaller scale before,” says McKinsey partner Jonathan Tilley, who helped lead the effort. “It’s not plug and play. I was nervous, and we all knew what a loss in output meant for people who needed ventilators.” During removal, teams would video-record and catalogue every screw, bolt, and connector to help the receiving teams put it all back together. The transit process was scrutinized for weather conditions and other variables. The team even consulted a satellite manufacturer to learn about preventing vibration damage en route to the new facility. “This entire move was conceived, decided, and completed in less than ten days,” Jonathan adds. “By working together, we all pulled it off.” The “lift and shift” success turned out to be one proof point in a massive success story. As the project progressed into the fall of 2020, Vyaire’s global delivery of ventilators crossed 35,000, with peak rates of more than 600 per day sustained on one product line, with more than 1,000 across all. “I still remember when the call came across to join this effort,” says McKinsey senior expert and associate partner Phil Duncan, who helped lead the work. “It was one of those moments in your career when you know you’ve just got to do it. It was a little nerve-wracking at points. It was emotional and meaningful. We all have a ton of pride in this because we did the work together.” Ten lessons on supply-chain readiness. By Ron Ritter Vyaire and Spirit got so much right in this unprecedented effort. Here’s what we learned from them. There is tremendous gain in getting this ever more right, as Vyaire and Spirit have shown us. Routine cost and delivery performance can improve through everyday enhancements across the organization. Stronger, more confident, and better-prepared organizational talent will build lasting culture around a sense of purpose. More rigorous design standards and better supplier networks are better able to respond with resiliency, and the brand will be stronger and more credible in projecting to the market. In normal days, operations will deliver better, faster, cheaper, safer. In a crisis, it may make all the difference in a decisive response. At peak, Vyaire was producing more ventilators in three days than their entire 2019 output. Over 19,000 units were built in the Kansas factory in just over 12 weeks by Spirit’s workforce. Similar feats were accomplished at other plants around the world, including among thousands of component suppliers. “We all worked together to create a state-of-the-art ventilator-production operation, supply chain, logistics, and workforce in less than six weeks that sent critical devices to patients in need around the world,” says Spirit’s CEO Tom Gentile. “I could not be prouder of what we all have done.” Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal agrees. “Yes, it was bold, and daunting at times, but there was never a chance we weren’t going to stand up to this moment,” he says. “Patients and customers were counting on us and our collective teams to meet the challenge.” This particular moment may have passed, and critical-care ventilator demand has since eased, but according to McKinsey’s Ron Ritter, the campaign nevertheless stands as an epic industrial success: “It also says a lot about what organizations can do when they have the courage to face what feels like an impossible objective, and inspire their people to do the same.” Related Practice To learn more about how McKinsey helps organizations improve manufacturing, please visit our Operations website , where you can also gain insight into CEO leadership of operations, supply-chain resilience , and much more.", "summary": "In response to COVID-19, Vyaire Medical partnered with Spirit AeroSystems and McKinsey to dramatically increase ventilator production.

That was when Wayne Brown, the operations manager at the Vistra-owned Martin Lake Power Plant, built and deployed a heat rate optimizer (HRO). About Vistra and its emissions-reduction goals Vistra Corp. is the largest competitive power producer in the United States and operates power plants in 12 states with a capacity of more than 39,000 megawatts of electricity—enough to power nearly 20 million homes. Vistra has committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent by 2030 (against a 2010 baseline) and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve its goals, the business is increasing efficiency in all its power plants and transforming its generation fleet by retiring coal plants and investing in solar- and battery-energy storage, which includes the world’s largest grid-scale battery energy-storage facility. Vistra’s to path to net zero will also require it to grow its zero-carbon portfolio to more than 7000 megawatts by 2026. The “heat rate” is a measure of the thermal efficiency of the plant—the amount of fuel required for each unit of electricity produced. To reach the optimal heat rate, plant operators continuously monitor and tune hundreds of variables, or “set points” on things like steam temperatures, pressures, oxygen levels, and fan speeds. It’s a lot for any operator to get right 100 percent of the time—so Vistra thought AI could help. Partnering for innovation With this goal in mind, Wayne and his group worked together with a McKinsey team that included data scientists and machine learning engineers from QuantumBlack AI by McKinsey , to build a multilayered neural-network model—essentially an algorithm powered by AI that learns about the effects of complex nonlinear relationships. This model went through two years’ worth of data at the plant and learned which combination of external factors—such as temperature and humidity—and internal decisions, like set points that operators control, would optimize the algorithm and attain the best heat-rate efficiency at any point in time. Vistra team members provided continuous guidance about the intricacies of how the plant worked, and identified critical data sources from sensors, which helped McKinsey engineers refine the model, adding and removing variables to see how those changes affected the heat rate. Through this training process, and by introducing better data, the models “learned” to make ever more accurate predictions. When the models were accurate to 99 percent or higher and run through a rigorous set of real-world tests, a McKinsey team of machine learning engineers converted them into an AI-powered engine. This generated recommendations every 30 minutes for operators to improve the plant’s heat-rate efficiency. At a meeting with all of Vistra’s leaders to review the HRO, Lloyd Hughes, a seasoned operations manager at the company’s Odessa plant, said, “There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon.” There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon. With this kind of power at their fingertips, Wayne and his team could make better, more informed decisions. Acting on the HRO recommendations helped Martin Lake run more than two percent more efficiently after just three months in operation, resulting in $4.5 million per year in savings and 340,000 tons of carbon abated. This carbon reduction was the equivalent of taking 66,000 cars off the road. 1 Calculations based on “ Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References “, United States Environmental Protection Agency If that doesn’t sound like a lot, consider this: companies that build gas-fueled power plants invest millions of dollars in research and development over four to five years to achieve a one-percent improvement in power-generation efficiency. Vistra hit that improvement level in only one-twentieth the amount of time using the data and equipment it already had. 2 Calculations based on source material from “A Brief History of GE Gas Turbines”, Power , July 8, 2019, and Frequently asked questions, US Energy Information Administration, last reviewed September 20, 2021 Creating value beyond the hype Vistra has since rolled the HRO out to another 67 power-generation units across 26 plants, for an average one-percent improvement in efficiency, and more than $23 million in savings. Along with the other AI initiatives, these efforts have helped Vistra abate about 1.6 million tons of carbon per year, which is ten percent of its remaining 2030 carbon-reduction commitment. That’s equivalent to offsetting about 50 percent of what a 500-megawatt coal plant emits. What happened at Martin Lake has happened at dozens of Vistra’s other power plants, with more than 400 AI models (and counting) deployed across the company’s fleet to help operators make even better decisions. It also reflects a core trait of Vistra’s AI transformation, which is that it isn’t a story of one massive hit, but rather the story of dozens of meaningful improvements snowballing to deliver significant value in terms of accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth. It’s also the story of how an organization architected an approach to rapidly scale every successful AI solution across the entire business. And it’s a story of how a continuous improvement culture, combined with a powerful AI modeling capability, helped leaders and plant operators do their jobs better than ever before. With more than $60 million captured in about one year of work and another $40 million in progress, Vistra is well on its way to delivering against a roadmap of $250-$300 million in identified EBITDA and more than two million tons of carbon abatement per year. The AI-driven advances at Vistra have heralded a generational shift in the power sector in terms of improvements in efficiency, reliability, safety, and sustainability.\nIf the one-percent improvement in efficiency the HRO delivered across the fleet was carried across all coal- and gas-fired plants in the US electric-power generation industry, 15 million tons of carbon would be abated annually—the equivalent of decommissioning more than two large coal plants or planting about 37 million trees. 3 The tree equivalency is based on calculations derived from the “The global tree restoration potential” study, published in the journal Science, July 5, 2019. That means less fuel needed to deliver power to the hospitals, schools, and businesses that rely on it. AI has the potential to bring similar levels of improvement to renewables as well, making them a more cost-effective and attractive energy option. Turning points on the AI journey Healthy skepticism and a culture of favoring action over words at Vistra meant that the biggest hurdle in the AI journey wasn’t the technology: it was the people. Vistra leadership and operations managers needed to know what AI could do and be convinced it could really work. It was this ingrained culture of continuous improvement—alongside a highly competitive market and a commitment to sustainability—that convinced Vistra’s leadership they needed to give AI a chance. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Seeing real possibilities The first question was a relatively simple one: “How can AI help improve the way Vistra generates power?” Answers to that question bubbled over when 50 of Vistra’s top leaders came to a McKinsey-hosted workshop. In multiple sessions, experts explained how AI worked, walked through detailed case studies showing how other companies used analytics and AI to generate value and gave live demonstrations of technologies, including digitized workflows and machine learning. Leaders in analytics from various sectors—including Amazon, Falkonry, Element Analytics, and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, as well as G2VP from the venture-capital world—provided insights and examples of how AI works. “I saw an example of how a metallurgical plant was using AI to help its operators optimize set points and it clicked for me,” remembers Patrick “Cade” Hay, the plant manager for Vistra’s Lamar power plant. “I saw how I could translate that into helping me run my own plants more efficiently. This was my lightbulb moment.” Company leaders and plant managers poured over process flow sheets and engineering diagrams to determine pain points as well as opportunities. This exercise allowed them to focus first on finding where the value was, then secondly on what technologies were needed to deliver it. Many of the operations opportunities were around yield and energy optimization and predictive maintenance, which according to our research, were the top AI use cases for manufacturing industries . By the end of the session, Vistra had developed a strategy to develop a series of AI solutions that could capture $250-$300 million in potential EBITDA while helping the company achieve its 2030 emissions-reductions goals. Codeveloping the AI While the analysis looked promising, proving it in the field was what mattered. “If our plant managers aren’t bought in, then things don’t happen,” explained Barry Boswell, Vistra’s executive vice president of power-generation operations. “So, we said, ‘Let’s pick a leader who is knowledgeable and skeptical, because if we can win them over, we can get everyone.’” They picked Cade. Not only did he run a top-performing plant in terms of profitability, reliability, and heat rate, he had a reputation for telling it like it is—Barry trusted Cade to tell him whether or not the value potential in AI was real. When he approached Cade about testing out a proof of concept to optimize duct burners, he was intrigued but predictably skeptical. Cade saw the potential in AI but was interested in finding out if it could actually help in the field. Duct burners essentially work like afterburners in jet planes; they provide a surge of energy when needed. Operators use them as supplements to hit energy targets, which are known as their “dispatch point.” The issue is that powering duct burners uses more fuel than regular methods, so it’s more expensive, generates more carbon emissions, and increases the wear and tear on equipment. McKinsey subject matter experts, data scientists, and analytics translators from QuantumBlack worked closely with a team from Vistra comprised of power generation and process experts as well as front-line operators to understand how the plant works, what data was available from the sensors already in place, and what variables could be directed—like the fact that the number of cooling fans running could be controlled, while the ambient temperature couldn’t. Working together Denese Ray, operations shift supervisor for Vistra’s Coleto Creek power plant; Doug Richter, the shift supervisor at the same plant; and Muro Kaku, McKinsey analyst and data scientist, discuss how they worked together. Denese: “Every week, I’d bring in a different supervisor to join us for our check-in calls with McKinsey. In this way, Muro and the McKinsey team saw what we were dealing with. We really needed all our supervisors and their feedback to build the model so we could get the most from it.” Muro: “That really mattered. For example, when we first trialed the HRO at the Coleto Creek plant, the recommendations were frequently rejected by the operators. We didn’t know why. When we spoke with the operators, they told us about specific rejection reasons, such as the tool recommended increasing superheat temperature by 30 degrees in a 15-minute interval to maximize the heat rate, but it takes the plant longer to heat up, so they rejected the recommendation. We then added a constraint to the tool to keep the increase and decrease to five degrees in a 15-minute interval, which operators could achieve.” Doug: “During load changes [increase or decrease in power output], the parameters are changing constantly, so recommendations to increase air flow at that time were counterproductive. We worked with McKinsey to have the recommendations stop for 30 minutes while we were changing load until the plant was stable again.” Denese: “We were all pretty skeptical of the tool at first, but when we got to play with the heat rate optimizer and see how it worked, and how well McKinsey worked with us in the plant, we understood how it could help.” As the teams developed the models, plant operators reviewed recommendations to see what made sense, what other variables needed to be tested, and what kinds of recommendations the operators would find most helpful. By analyzing the effect of various inputs and set points on the plant—such as pressure and humidity, the angle of blades in the gas turbine, usage of inlet cooling technologies, and the age and performance of various components like filters and condensers—and running it through the model, the analysis was clear: overall duct-burner usage could be reduced by approximately 30 percent, which would result in the equivalent of $175,000 of yearly savings on fuel costs and wear and tear on the system, in addition to an abatement of about 4,700 tons of carbon per year. “We worked closely with the team from McKinsey to develop AI models that reflected the realities of how power plants operate,” said Cade, “and then when we saw the recommendations coming out of the AI tool, I saw how much real value there was.” Going for scale and adoption from the beginning Vistra’s leadership realized from the beginning that the only way to achieve their efficiency and carbon-abatement aspirations was to scale every solution. “We manage the Vistra fleet as one. If a plant is doing something that works, we want every plant to do it,” says Barry. “That’s what we’re built to do.” That realization led Vistra to invest in a five-part system to scale and sustain AI solutions. *** AI solution deep dive QuantumBlack’s Ayush Talwar, an expert associate partner, provides more details on the AI model development: What kind of models did you use? We used a range of models to fit the specific needs of the plant and the solution. These ranged from Bayesian regression models to deep-learning models. How did you choose which model to use? We wanted to find the right balance between model performance, meaning its accuracy; explainability, which describes relationships to the operators; the source richness, which refers to the amount of data available; potential actionability, or how many of the most important features in the model people can actually control; and maintainability, which will reduce need for more technical skills to maintain them. How would you compare the models you used to older ones? Our models were more accurate than previous models, and importantly, more actionable. We used a variety of metrics to measure model performance such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Our models typically achieved MAPEs of less than 1.5 percent. How did you build up your models? Each neural network model was made up of several layers with each layer containing batch normalization, dropout, and activation. We created cross validation and out-of-sample testing sets using time-based splits to prevent overfitting models. We added features based primarily on domain expertise. How did you turn models into tools operators could use? We used machine learning models to make accurate predictions of outcomes. We then wrapped meta-heuristic optimization algorithms around those models to generate recommendations that helped operators make decisions about how to run the plant better. The models were then embedded within the existing production workflows and deployed live in the operator room. Vistra’s story is far from finished. As Cade put it, “We’re just looking at the tip of the iceberg.” Vistra’s roadmap for 2022 and 2023 includes bringing AI to its rapidly growing renewables fleet of solar and batteries to optimize yield and reliability, among other initiatives. To help sustain this ambition, Vistra is building up its talent bench. In addition to hiring a small team of data scientists and engineers, Rachit has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas to offer basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in AI and analytics for Vistra employees. Some 70 people have already completed courses, including those reskilling from statistics to machine learning. Vistra has also built relationships with local colleges and universities to develop internship programs and work with students in capstone projects to identify top technical talent. “We can’t sit around and just do what we did yesterday to be ready for tomorrow,” Barry says. “We’ve seen enough to know what’s possible.” The authors would like to thank Wayne Brown, Rachit Gupta, Patrick “Cade” Hay, Lloyd Hughes, Denese Ray, and Doug Richter from Vistra Corp., and Richard Bates, Dan Hurley, Pablo Illuzzi, Nephi Johnson, Muro Kaku, Jay Kim, George Lederman, Abhay Prasanna, Noel Ramirez, and Ayush Talwar from McKinsey.

Three days earlier, Reina, 15 at the time, had acted on suicidal thoughts, and Kana spent nearly every hour since searching for mental health crisis resources for adolescents. Everyone told her the same thing: take her to the ER. Kana, who is now the director of brain health at the McKinsey Health Institute, is also a 25-year veteran in the behavioral health arena and knew the ER wouldn’t help her daughter—but there was no other option. The doctor recommended inpatient care, but no beds were available, so for three and a half days, Reina was confined to a glass-walled room under bright lights and constant surveillance, isolated from everyone except her mom, who slept in the hospital chair next to her as they waited for a bed to open up in the adolescent psych unit. “Sitting in an emergency room for days at a time, not being able to get the help your kid needs is devastating,” Kana says. “I had advocated for evidence-based mental health services throughout my career, yet couldn’t find them for my own child.” A growing behavioral health crisis Kana and Reina’s experience isn’t uncommon. In the United States, crises related to behavioral health, a term that refers to both mental and substance use disorders, have been on the rise for more than two decades—particularly among youth. Between 2009 and 2020, the United States saw a 30 percent increase in the national age-adjusted suicide rate. By winter of 2021 , the weekly rate of ER visits by adolescents who attempted suicide was 39 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the average rate for adolescent girls had increased 50 percent over the previous year. Despite these alarming numbers, community crisis-care resources remain limited. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline center, roughly 39 million Americans aged 12 and older could benefit from having access to a service for vulnerable people dealing with suicide, mental health, or substance use issues. Limited crisis services mean law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and ERs end up responding to most behavioral health crises, regardless of whether the individual is a threat to public safety or in need of emergency care. “What we're doing now is services that are high cost and low efficacy,” says Kana. “It’s the wrong recipe.” Dr. John Palmieri is a senior medical advisor and the acting director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Behavioral Health Crisis Team , which includes the 988 Lifeline. He spent the early part of his clinical career working in emergency psychiatric departments and witnessed firsthand the misdirection of care and resources for those in behavioral health crisis. “You see the downstream effects of where the system fails in so many ways when you’re in those settings day after day,” he says. “How are we looking upstream to prevent these crisis situations from happening in the first place or recurring?” A hotline to help those in need The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, passed in 2020, made “988” the official nationwide three-digit behavioral health crisis number as of July 2022. This meant that, for the first time, those experiencing a behavioral health crisis anywhere in the country would only have to remember three digits to find the appropriate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline first launched in 2005 as a ten-digit number. At the time, Kana was working for the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA, which oversaw the number’s rollout. Over the years, she watched the Lifeline evolve, expanding to include options for Spanish language, veterans’ crises, and disaster distress help lines. “I've been along for the journey of the growth of the Lifeline and saw advocacy from the field trying to advance a three-digit calling number,” she says. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. The new easy-to-remember number, while hugely promising, raises at least one potential challenge. Call volume—rising over the years—has already begun skyrocketing since the new number launched. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. To help localities and stakeholders across the country prepare for this surge, the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), the firm's non-profit-generating entity that focuses on addressing public health challenges, has been involved in a range of nationwide efforts. This includes helping ensure states, contact centers, first responders, and community behavioral health providers know exactly what they need to meet demand—be it new strategies, workforce training, data infrastructure upgrades, or other support. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Defining effective crisis care In December 2020, MHI came together with a group of national behavioral health and crisis-care stakeholders for a series of working sessions organized by Vibrant Emotional Health , the not-for-profit administrator of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; RI International , a global organization focused on the design and delivery of behavioral health crisis services; and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) . The goal was to help prepare for the launch of 988. MHI began by listening to 911 managers, mental health and substance-use treatment providers, contact center operators, and first responders to develop a consensus around the critical dimensions of crisis care. MHI gathered input from participating partners on what critical elements of community-based crisis care were necessary for the delivery of the 988 Lifeline. These conversations helped establish a shared understanding among stakeholders around the priorities of community-based crisis care: ensuring that anyone in crisis has someone to call, someone to help, and a safe place to go, as envisioned in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care . Simple as it sounds, this involves developing a continuum of care that includes the 988 crisis line staffed by local workers who can provide information, deescalate crises, and—when in-person support is needed—connect people with nearby services and relevant resources. Had this kind of response existed in 2019, Kana and her daughter would have had a place to go besides the ER; one that might have provided appropriate care and helped ease already constrained hospital capacity. About the McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating global entity within McKinsey. MHI strives to catalyze actions across continents, sectors, and communities to achieve material improvements in health, adding years to life and life to years. Core to this aspiration is improving brain health. Brain disorders take a significant toll on both life expectancy and quality of life. In particular, the urgent and rising rate of mental health, substance use, and suicidal crises globally calls for a transformation of access to mobile crisis response and community-based crisis services. Through its foundational collaboration-based approach, MHI brings together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health. The result is meaningful impact on initiatives like the rollout of 988 in the United States and similar multistakeholder partnerships on crisis care around the world. Measuring costs and savings involved What would it take to ensure such crises are handled by trained professionals—including clinicians, peers, and other provider types—across a coordinated continuum of care in every community? To help answer this question, MHI began working with RI International in 2021 to build the Crisis Resource Need Calculator , a web-based cost calculator that allows local leaders to see a projection of annual behavioral health crisis care costs by county or state. The calculator enables them to understand the cost of providing for every individual in need of local, in-person crisis care based on SAMHSA’s national guidelines. It also considers how many mobile crisis teams states and counties would need, and what resources that would involve to build out to scale. The Crisis Resource Need Calculator also highlights potential healthcare savings available by making this shift in resources. Overall, the calculator estimates that with fully resourced community-based crisis systems in place, the United States could save a total of $34 billion in annual behavioral health costs otherwise spent on ER visits and inpatient beds. Helping build an action plan In addition to care costs, MHI also attempted to better assess responder readiness for the transition to 988. To do this, from November 2021 to March 2022, MHI partnered with state, federal, and local entities to develop detailed operational assessment playbooks to help key audiences, including states, tribes and territories, crisis contact operators, 911 centers, and behavioral health providers with understanding how they can prepare for the change. “The McKinsey team has been the glue that helped put this all together,” says Brian Hepburn, executive director of NASMHPD, which partnered with SAMHSA to prepare for 988’s 2022 rollout. “The effectiveness of the work is dependent on what happens between meetings, and McKinsey filled those gaps with needed data.” In March 2022, the 988 playbooks were released at a gathering of federal, state, and local stakeholders from across the field. They have since been shared with organizations like the National Council of State Legislators and the National Governors Association to help inform the efforts to scale 988. They’ve also been distributed by partners including the National Emergency Number Association , the National Association for State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors , and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing . Each playbook is geared toward a specific crisis-response group, including 911 professionals, Lifeline network contact centers, mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers, states, territories, and tribes. The playbooks were designed to help state and local leaders understand whether they’re properly staffed, funded, and prepared for 988 response and how to get there. “These playbooks offer stakeholders a self-assessment of their own readiness and links to specific recommendations and tools,” says Brian. Ensuring equitable care One of the ongoing challenges these playbooks attempt to tackle is creating equitable crisis care across communities. Ensuring underserved communities have their unique needs taken into consideration is one of the biggest challenges facing the current system, says Shelby Rowe, director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center . Shelby, a citizen of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma who has personally experienced suicidal episodes, sits on the board of RI International and advocates for marginalized groups and tribal communities to get access to the full spectrum of crisis care.\n“If you’re a 15-year-old black trans girl, your experience asking for help in Brooklyn, New York is going to be very different from your experience asking for help in rural Oklahoma,” she says. Creating a more equitable system requires including diverse voices of those with lived experiences and addressing the underlying challenges and limitations facing specific communities. For example, tribal boundaries don’t always align to state lines, which keeps tribal communities from accessing crisis resource funding; the needs of vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ youth; the lack of access to crisis response in remote rural communities; the struggles people of color face when attempting to find medical or crisis help, and the list goes on. “We have an opportunity and an obligation to build a truly equitable crisis response system,” says Shelby. Creating a sustainable model Today, crisis response and stabilization services are primarily funded by federal, state, and local governments. Many crisis contact centers are transitioning from trained volunteer workforces to paid specialized staff. Yet an equitable, fully resourced continuum requires sustainable funding and commitment to meet diverse needs across communities. To support this, MHI and its collaborators, NASMHPD and SAMHSA, are working on several ongoing efforts. This includes examining healthcare claims to better understand how crisis services are paid for, developing a tool to forecast the number of healthcare workers a state or community needs for crisis care, and developing models and strategies to lessen the burden on the crisis workforce. The idea is that state and local governments, payers, and providers can use these resources to better support the current workforce, focus workforce development efforts, and plan for long-term financial sustainability. “The McKinsey team’s expertise in analytics helped identify some of the root-cause factors driving workforce shortages and what financing models can impact this journey along the crisis treatment system,” says SAMHSA’s John Palmieri. Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives. It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. All of these moving parts come together to steer a broader plan of action for crisis care in the United States. The five-year vision put forth by SAMHSA includes the goal of having 90 percent or more of all 988 calls answered in-state by the end of 2023, up from 71 percent in 2020 , and providing 80 percent or more of individuals in the United States with access to mobile crisis response and local services in the next two to five years. “What’s missing today is widespread, community-based approaches to managing suicidality, mental health crises, and substance use crises both for adults and kids,” says Kana. “Those are the services communities need and getting them actually costs much less and produces better outcomes.” Including for people like Reina. Since the initial frightening 2019 episode, Kana and her daughter had several others before the family found support through a local county-run organization offering in-home counseling and support to kids and families in need. Reina has since become an advocate for crisis support for teenagers and started a not for profit in her community to raise awareness for suicide prevention and youth mental health. “Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives,” says Kana. “It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. It’s going take a lot of cross-sector collaboration to transform our nation’s response to behavioral health crises, and MHI is a committed partner along the way.” Related Articles Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z Addressing employee burnout: Are you solving the right problem?

ECU Worldwide is one of the largest less-than-container-load shippers in the world, with 30 years of experience, servicing close to 2,400 trade routes across 180 countries and 40,000 port pairs across the globe. In December 2019, just before the start of the global pandemic, leadership from ECU Worldwide began working with McKinsey to chart a plan for an ambitious transformation – an 18-month program called “Voyager.” The program would lead ECU Worldwide to a complete organizational overhaul that put in place leadership co-ordination and new technology that offered a better experience for their global workforce and customers. As a result, ECU Worldwide saw sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries and an overall doubling of earnings from 2018 to 2021. And they achieved all of this during a period of unprecedented disruption in their industry. The challenge ECU Worldwide operates a 4,500-person team out of more than 300 offices across the world, including offices in India, the United States, and Europe. These locations have accelerated growth into new markets. But they have also brought new challenges to operational cohesion. Locations were run as independent units rather than as parts of an interconnected global business. Sales teams traditionally focused on order fulfillment and issue resolution, rather than customer pipeline building; and in more mature markets, like Europe and the United States, resource utilization wasn’t optimized. Some locations were operating beyond capacity while others were being underutilized. Founder and chairman Shashi Kiran Shetty knew ECU Worldwide needed a new growth strategy. “We believed the company could do far more in terms of market share,” says Shashi. “We needed a digital strategy that would make us future-ready and help build the company into a global leader in the logistics industry.” The solution As the pandemic began upending the global logistics industry, ECU Worldwide worked with McKinsey to focus their goals into a resilient, long-term growth strategy that built operational cohesion and created digital solutions to give them a competitive advantage. “ECU Worldwide wanted a strategy that would make them future-ready and better integrate their people and operations around the world,” says McKinsey associate partner Chandan Kansal . “We helped them think through what organizational changes and digital solutions could make this happen.” Partner Neelesh Mundra leads McKinsey’s logistics work in India and co-leads our manufacturing and supply-chain work in Asia. “More than 50 colleagues from our offices across the world, and experts from our capabilities like McKinsey Digital , Implementation , and People & Organizational Performance , helped bring the best of our firm to this transformation,” he says. After an intensive diagnostic sprint, McKinsey and ECU Worldwide developed Voyager, a transformation plan that featured four central pillars: improving sales efficiency, transforming operations using analytics, optimizing the customer journey, and creating a future-ready organization. How it was done McKinsey helped the company identify more than 15 geographies across three major markets – Europe, Asia, and North America – that comprised the majority of ECU Worldwide’s overall business. The company looked closely at how sales teams in these regions worked with their customers, defined growth milestones, and conducted customer analyses to pinpoint specific country challenges and potential. ECU Worldwide then began working to strengthen connectivity among their sales teams. McKinsey helped build a coordination center that tracks KPIs, shipment movements, and sales and pricing across geographies. Decisions in different parts of the world could now be made and communicated across the organization in real-time, rather than taking several days or weeks to coordinate as they traditionally had. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth After the first 18 months, the growth strategy had been systematically put in place. It featured two major components. Technology transformation How tech enablement sets ECU Worldwide apart A big enabler of ECU Worldwide’s transformation was creating and streamlining centralized technologies that helped track what was happening across priority markets. Prior to this streamlining, data was often reported in different formats across different offices and might take several months to aggregate and review. The company worked with McKinsey to build automated management dashboards that gathered data from each market into a centralized center. A newly revamped customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360 , used data science to create a customer-centric experience. By onboarding new products and vendors onto the platform, ECU360 created a digital ecosystem spanning users across more than 80 countries, the largest of its kind. A complete organizational redesign ECU Worldwide’s focus then shifted to performance management, which the company led out of a new dedicated transformation office. “The important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization and institutionalization of best practices,” says Sanchita Mohanty, vice president of transformation for ECU Worldwide. “We had a detailed talent-value assessment identifying the key recruits we wanted for the organization to achieve the aspiration that we had set for ourselves.” The very important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization. The automated dashboards gave ECU Worldwide a framework for company-wide performance reviews. The company could now institute KPIs that were common across geographies and tied to the organization’s overall goals. With everyone looking at the same data, workers could see how they were a part of one global organization, working toward common objectives, rather than operating in silos. This impact was then sustained through a newly set up Data Science and Analytics Centre of Excellence. The impact The technology transformation created efficiencies across various areas of the business, improving ECU Worldwide’s resilience along with their visibility and control over cargo movements in the supply chain. The customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360, brought more customer insights to ECU Worldwide, resulting in a 25 percent increase in adoption and 90 percent customer retention rate. A new sales app helped increase productivity for the client workforce with more than 60 percent of bookings now done on ECU360. A yield management tool tracked value leakages and demand spikes, enabling teams to revamp sales strategies. And a redesigned sales accelerator app helped increase productivity by 150 percent. Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership. They implemented the rigor needed to move the organization in the way it needed to move. “This transformation program, Voyager, institutionalized a new way of working within the organization,” says Adarsh Hegde, joint managing director for ECU Worldwide. “Today if you talk to anybody in our offices in China, Germany, or India, you will find the same language being spoken by them.” While forwarders globally saw earnings growth during the pandemic due to demand bottlenecks, ECU Worldwide’s sales program was distinct in that it focused on volume growth specifically, which had been stagnant for several years. By focusing on key markets, ECU Worldwide’s transformation covered 80 percent of overall sales, resulting in sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries as well as sales growth from newly integrated less-than-container-load and trucking services in the past two years. Operations processing time was also reduced by 30 percent thanks to a model office playbook developed and deployed across more than ten countries to streamline operations and set up an ECU Worldwide way of working. Getting this strategy right has enabled the company to start exploring its next bold moves in air freight and cross-border ecommerce. “Bringing focus and drive was a common goal we all aspired for. We’d grown through many acquisitions and needed a common ECU way of doing business,” says Tim Tudor, CEO of ECU Worldwide. “Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership.

In fact, given Scope 3 emissions in their supply chains, manufacturing, transport, and construction are the most emission-heavy sectors in the world. Danfoss is one organization working to change that. One of the largest producers of component parts for heating and cooling, drives, and power solutions, the Nordic company’s net-zero transformation is helping manufacturers around the world green their supply chains. Would you like to learn more about our Sustainability Practice ? The opportunity With more than 42,000 employees across the world, Danfoss produces thousands of components each year. Used across manufacturing industries, these components find their way into countless technologies essential to keeping everyday life moving for people the world over. The company, says CEO Kim Fausing, has an opportunity to make a powerful environmental impact. “We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification,” says Kim. “We want to be the best-in-class preferred partner for customers looking to decarbonize and are taking our own medicine—continuously making the way we run our business more energy efficient.” We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification. Kim and Jürgen Fischer, president of Danfoss Climate Solutions began having high-level discussions with McKinsey in the summer of 2021 about how best to engage customers -- makers of equipment across these emission-heavy sectors who use Danfoss’s component parts – to become their preferred partner in decarbonization. The question at the center of those conversations: What should Danfoss’s decarbonization target be and how could the company make a realistic plan to meet it? Setting a course for net zero Danfoss’s Climate Solutions business is responsible for producing heating and cooling machinery components. Teaming up with McKinsey sustainability experts, Danfoss looked for ways to decarbonize various aspects of it. They learned that while the highest carbon emissions come from the use of products across their entire lifecycle, the second largest source of emissions lies in the materials and construction processes. Product redesign and an alternative supply chain offered two possible ways forward. “Material decarbonization is the next frontier for advanced industries,” says McKinsey partner Jacob Staun. “We helped Danfoss map out the complexity of their supply chains to identify sources of emission and design solutions with a positive impact on cost and carbon.” Innovating with technology To facilitate and accelerate the process, Danfoss, with the help of McKinsey, developed a digital platform that assesses carbon emissions along the entire supply chain of each product. This tool, called Zero Carbon Product, from McKinsey’s Catalyst Zero solution, mapped the company’s bill of materials for each product against a library of around 600 decarbonization levers spanning 100 material categories. The result was a cost-optimized decarbonization roadmap showing, for example, alternative suppliers for certain materials like iron, steel, and aluminum, that could help Danfoss create low-carbon versions of existing products still at low cost. Partnering for success The next step in the process was to test the roadmap’s likelihood of success. Pilot journeys were created for five products from Danfoss’s Climate Solutions portfolio. An assessment of these initial five products found that for a minimal increase in costs, emissions from materials purchased to make each product could be reduced by as much as 95 percent. Here was a clear path to eliminating most emissions at low cost. The program pinpointed exactly where reductions could be made and how – an assessment that took hours rather than days with traditional methods – thereby creating an opportunity to scale the solution across Danfoss’s large product line. At the same time, McKinsey conducted customer interviews to better understand the price elasticity of low-carbon products. This would help Danfoss determine which suppliers to team up with to pilot some of these new sustainable product line solutions. Building capabilities The next question was one of scale. Danfoss’s entire portfolio comprises hundreds of product lines, each with anywhere from tens to hundreds of product variances. While Danfoss has around 5,000 suppliers, McKinsey’s analysis found that around half of total embodied emissions came from just 50 of those suppliers. This created a shortlist to focus on to have the greatest impact. Danfoss worked with McKinsey to build new capabilities, including embedding carbon assessments into product engineering and retraining employees to add decarbonization to their procurement strategy. “Building lower carbon products requires an entirely new way of working, one that requires new skill sets and embedding carbon reduction into every business process including procurement, product design, and go-to-market,” says McKinsey associate partner Jessica Fan. Decarbonizing at scale This has helped Danfoss achieve the goal of assessing its entire Climate Solutions product portfolio by the end of 2022 to create a clear product engineering roadmap moving forward. And it’s become part of a broader set of Science Based Targets : by 2030, Danfoss aims to reduce all direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy by 46.2 percent; reduce emissions across the value chain by 15 percent; and become carbon neutral across its operations. By the end of 2021 into early 2022, training personnel at Danfoss in how to move this decarbonization process forward became a priority. McKinsey deployed a train-the-trainer model, arming around 20 key Danfoss employees with the skills and tools needed to train employees across the organization to carry out this decarbonization mission. Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance. This train-the-trainer process involved identifying key people, making sure they were included in the initial five pilots, then conducting trainings and workshops so they could own the rollout of this new tool. The next step involved taking a closer look at the overall product launch strategy. While the company started with the Climate Solutions segment of its business, the goal is to complete this same process across its other two business units: Power Solutions, which makes up half of the overall business and Power Electronics and Drives, which accounts for another 30 percent. Danfoss is currently working with McKinsey in the proof-of-concept stage for its Power Electronics and Drives business as part of a two-and-a-half-year plan to roll out low carbon products across the entirety of the business. “Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance,” says Kim. “Danfoss is fully committed to both having a positive climate impact and also helping our customers become more climate-friendly through their use of our products and solutions.” Related Articles Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation An AI power play: Fueling the next wave of innovation in the energy sector How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "Danfoss, a global components manufacturer, is implementing a carbon reduction roadmap in partnership with McKinsey.

But there is opportunity here. Building new workforce capabilities can accelerate inclusive growth for national economies, increase socio-economic mobility among workers, and help organizations improve their financial and operational performance. Investing in upskilling and reskilling workers is urgent, yet the playbook for doing so is outdated and won’t meet the multiplying need. McKinsey’s recent reskilling capability-building work with a regional government department in Australia shows what’s possible—and what scale could look like. A global skills crisis A McKinsey Global Institute survey found that 87 percent of companies worldwide reported experiencing skill gaps now or are expecting to within the next five years, impacting productivity and competitiveness at corporate and national levels. Our analysis shows that Japan will need a 2.5 fold increase in productivity growth over the next decade to maintain its recent GDP-growth rate. And the Tech Council of Australia forecasts that its nation will fall 200,000 tech workers short of its 1.2 million target by 2030, with only 7 percent of the non-tech workforce having a strong skills match with tech occupations. Nearly all respondents to the McKinsey Global Institute survey identified closing skill gaps as a main concern, yet only one-third of respondents say their organizations are prepared to address potential role disruptions. Only 28 percent say their organizations make effective decisions on how to close skill gaps. Upskilling and reskilling today’s workforce—in non-degree, skill-building programs—is critical to attracting and retaining talent while driving market competitiveness. “Hiring alone will not meet future workforce demands,” says Rod Farmer, a McKinsey associate partner in Sydney and leader of customer experience and design work in Asia-Pacific for McKinsey Digital. “We’re rapidly moving from a job-based to a skills-based economy requiring more nimble, tech-savvy, and multi-disciplinary teams. We’re seeing significant skills gaps emerging across all sectors of the Australian labor market and broadly across Asia.” One organization that understands this is Australia’s Department of Regional New South Wales (DRNSW), a government department supporting regional communities through agriculture, local infrastructure projects, soil conservation, environmental stewardship, economic development, and more. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated DRNSW’s need for a future-ready workforce. With most employees based in remote areas, many observed an increased need for digital skills but had not received the necessary technological training prior to the pandemic. Increased reliance on digital and data skills became both a strain on the agency’s productivity and accelerated digital inclusivity challenges. Identifying needs, seeing new potential At the onset of the pandemic, DRNSW took stock of its employees’ digital capabilities. The department uncovered a range of digital literacy challenges, ranging from frontline workers relying on friends and colleagues for help with basic digital tasks, such as emails and timesheets, to more complex tasks involving spreadsheets, where increased skills mastery was now essential. We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting. “We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting,” says Donna Mcleod, acting chief people officer of DRNSW. “It was a shock. We had to figure out how to make a fundamental, baseline shift.” DRNSW had tried traditional learning approaches in the past, which fell short of shifting needs and operating models. It needed to move beyond employees learning on their own, separately from their work, which often leads to surface knowledge acquisition only. “We saw there was a major need here—an opportunity for innovation and new capability building models within DRNSW where we could support the people of New South Wales, while also tackling a larger national skills-gap challenge,” says Rod. Over the next 12 months, DRNSW and McKinsey built an enterprise Digital Skills Program, creating an entirely different reskilling engine at the heart of DRNSW. Reinventing skill building McKinsey and DRNSW began their journey by reframing the challenge. DRNSW took an applied skills development approach, focusing on the jobs-to-be-done. This shift meant an increased focus on employee-backed, context-dependent, and on-the-job skills development—solving real day-to-day people development and productivity needs. Core to the DRNSW approach was contextualized learning: the notion that skill development does not happen in a classroom but while employees are on the job, with direct apprenticeship where they are able to immediately operationalize it. Human-centered design resulted in a program informed by a deep study of the individual’s and organization’s needs and pain points, brought to life through ethnographic research across regional and rural New South Wales, addressed in small peer-based groups with individual coaching, and supported by short feedback cycles. “One of the universal pain points we observed was that it’s very difficult for people to make time for upskilling and reskilling beyond their day-to-day responsibilities,” says Donna. “It was important for us to develop a program that placed skill building at the core of their workday, supported by peers and mentors.” The new DRNSW Skills Program helps to identify the specific skills, competencies and proficiency levels required at an organizational level within DRNSW roles. The program then helps assess employee skills, develop tailored programs to close the gaps, and support individuals in their role through direct peer-led coaching. Furthermore, the program scales from shorter upskilling modules to larger reskilling programs to support lateral internal hiring. “We now measure skills readiness in months, not years,” says Rod, who led the DRNSW’s skills transformation. “This isn’t a yearly one-and-done type of problem. Organizations need to institute continuous reskilling and upskilling if they are to maintain future-ready workforces.” To achieve this skills transformation, McKinsey and DRNSW worked with Mentem by UNSW. A new, independent business launched and backed by the University of New South Wales, Mentem helps corporate businesses upskill and reskill their employees at scale through tailored on-the-job training. This collaboration also provided employees the potential to receive micro-credentialling through time spent learning on the job—enabling access to credentialled learning at a global top 50 higher-education institution. Building Mentem by UNSW, a reskilling business UNSW—like many top universities—recognized the opportunity to further extend its post-graduate services beyond its more traditional offerings. Importantly, it also recognized that this challenge required the university to develop new operating and service models that leveraged its unique assets and heritage in adult learning, whilst accelerating product innovation and industry collaboration. To help realise its ambitions, UNSW partnered with Leap by McKinsey (McKinsey’s venture building capability) who helped design, build and launch the new venture at pace. “We’d never have been able to independently build a blueprint for a business this fast—we did it in 12 weeks, which is unheard of at a university for something of this magnitude,” says Arvind. “Mentem exists to provide new educational models for employer and workforce needs in Australia and globally,” says Arvind Sampath, founding chief executive officer of Mentem. “Working with DRNSW was an exciting opportunity to leverage our knowledge and revitalize a government agency we all rely on.” Another core element of the DRNSW Digital Skills Program is the ‘skills hub,’ critical for engaging the broader DRNSW organization and ensuring sustained impact as the program scaled. This new operational unit consists of a DRNSW squad with capability building specialists, human-centered designers, instructional designers, and program delivery experts. To evaluate impact and prove the viability of scaling up the new program, Mentem developed a unique learning analytics platform that measured individual and cohort performance over time, leveraging learner management system analytics, project results, and coach feedback. The platform also provides automated interventions, or nudges, to individuals and coaches to drive program engagement and behavior change. Transformative results For DRNSW, the results exceeded expectations—and in record time—with over 90 percent employee satisfaction and 85 percent of participants reporting improved applied skills. The 8-week courses are now scaling across DRNSW. “Other agencies couldn’t believe we built, piloted and started scaling this entire new approach to capability building in six months when this can typically take two or three years in government,” Donna says. “It was a phenomenal delivery.” Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. These types of changes, scaled throughout the agency, increased productivity and delivered improved services for constituents. Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. The program has already been recognized for its impact and employee-centric approach, winning the Best in Class award in the public-sector category from Good Design Australia, one of the most prestigious design awards in the world. But the biggest testament to its success is the difference it made in the careers of the employees. “You have to realize, this has absolutely changed people’s lives,“ says Donna. Participants reported very high levels of increased confidence in performing their work, value from their coaches and overall satisfaction with the program. “The program was very different from anything I’ve done before,” says Charlene, who completed the program. “The coaching was my highlight of the week.” “To do these jobs, the way everything’s going digital, you need to upskill to get there,” says Glenn, another participant. “I thought, ‘wow, this program is for me.’” The stakes for DRNSW were high—delivering government services that drive value for citizens is essential. But for corporate institutions, it could very much be a question of survival. “If a government agency like DRNSW can make such a major shift with a traditionally non-digital workforce, then enterprises can meet the moment too.” says Roland Dillon, a partner with McKinsey’s Public & Social Sector practice based in Melbourne. “Not doing so could lead to an existential crisis as competitors not only leapfrog the market, but do so while taking talent that is hungry to learn and develop in an increasingly digital world.” Related Articles Future of  Work Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "A government agency in Australia, DRNSW, partnered with McKinsey to address the skills crisis exacerbated by the pandemic.

Many of them shop at Makro, a well-known Thai wholesaler, to meet that demand. The global pandemic has highlighted the essential role these wholesale suppliers play in society—and the opportunity they have, to accelerate their own digital transformations, build new e-commerce capabilities, and better serve customers. When leaders at CP AXTRA Public Company Limited decided to make a digital transformation, they partnered with McKinsey to identify the right strategy, lead with technology, and ensure their transformation would endure. The opportunity The first B2B online platform of its kind Makro was only capturing 10 percent of buyers’ share of wallet. Their customers typically went to other suppliers, from smaller vegetable producers to wet markets, to fulfill their commercial needs. “That adds a lot of operational overhead for them, causing a lack of efficiency in running their businesses,” says Tirayu Songvetkasem, chief digital officer of CP AXTRA. The advent of the pandemic accelerated these challenges and helped create momentum to solve for this customer need. We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working. “Makro comes from a very classic business background,” says Paul Howe, group chief information officer of CP AXTRA . “We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working.” How it was done Building products, teams, and a trust-based relationship Leap by McKinsey experts partnered with CP AXTRA to build a new digital platform where business owners could access a real-time view of wholesale inventory from hundreds of suppliers in a single app. Known as Makro PRO, the platform offers streamlined goods-purchasing for hotels, restaurants, and cafes. “Building Makro PRO from scratch was a new experience for us. For the platform to be successful, we needed a very solid and future-ready technology stack and architecture,” says Yanawee Sarotnunjeen, a product owner at Makro PRO. “We worked with McKinsey to help us accelerate the technology build and make it secure and highly scalable. McKinsey brought in expert digital talent, including product builders and strategists, software engineers, data scientists and designers—and embedded them within our team. Today the technology that supports Makro PRO has been embedded into other parts of our organization.” As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth. After the initial build, CP AXTRA knew it had to build its own tech talent bench to sustain and scale the platform. “We worked with McKinsey to hire and build tech capabilities systematically across different roles and seniority levels,” says Yanawee. “In six months, we grew the Makro PRO team from 0 to 60 people.” Over the project, McKinsey helped CP AXTRA to embed upskilling and professional development into the fabric of the organization’s culture, building capabilities of more than 200 colleagues who are dedicated to Makro PRO, and updating compensation and benefits for the company. As Dymfke Kuijpers, a McKinsey senior partner who leads our retail work globally and our consumer work in Asia explains: “As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth themselves. In the end, tech is never the bottleneck—a lack of people and capabilities are.” Uncovering pain points Building a minimum viable product from scratch “We were true partners across each and every part of the business build, working as one team,” says Tomas Laboutka, a McKinsey expert associate partner. “This kind of collaboration made it easy to share ideas, test and iterate quickly, and ultimately create a trust-based relationship that was critical as we worked remotely most of the time.” The impact Unlocking opportunities for employees, small farmers, and businesses alike Over the last two years, CP AXTRA has reskilled more than 200 employees to support its omni-channel business and Makro PRO platform, which now processes thousands of orders daily with tens of thousands of products available on the platform. Elsewhere, CP AXTRA expands the opportunity for sellers like small farmers to reach customers. “This impact is a result of a shared vision and excitement that we have with CP AXTRA for building a new business that can benefit many local businesses–the heartbeat of the Thai economy,” Tomas says. As Noppamas Sivakriskul, a McKinsey senior partner and the managing partner of our Thailand office, says: “This is a brand I’ve grown up with and loved.

While 40 to 45 percent of those chats usually get resolved by the current classic chatbot, that still leaves another 16,500 customers a week needing to speak with a live agent for help. This can leave customers with potentially longer waiting times as they’re only able to get live help for non-urgent requests during working hours. Generative AI’s ability to interact with human language in ways simply not possible before created an opportunity for teams from QuantumBlack, McKinsey's AI arm, and ING to explore how advanced chatbot technology could be used to improve the customer experience, giving customers the assistance they need immediately. This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry. From idea to impact The Solution Developing advanced chatbot capabilities A joint ING and McKinsey team worked closely together for seven weeks to build a generative AI chatbot that offered customers immediate tailored help while maintaining clear guardrails to mitigate risk. The team started with an in-depth analysis of the existing chatbot to identify specific challenges. The final solution consisted of a multi-step pipeline to generate the best answer for the customer including knowledge retrieval from available data stores and a ranking of potential answers by helpfulness. In the case when several helpful answers arose, the system would offer multiple options to the customer – a process called disambiguation. Lastly, before any answer was sent to the customer, a series of guardrails was applied. In order to do this, ING risk stakeholders were brought into this process from the very start and ING-specific guardrails (to avoid giving advice on mortgages and investment products, for example) were built using out-of-the-box tools from QuantumBlack Labs , our AI and machine learning innovation hub. The gen AI chatbot was released on testing days to 10 percent of real customers in the Netherlands who were using the support chat function on the mobile app. It offered a customer experience that was demonstrably superior to the classic chatbot, providing customers with much more detailed and tailored responses, and helping them resolve their queries faster. Since launching in September 2023, thousands of customers have interacted with the new gen AI chatbot, making it the first-of-its-kind real-life customer-facing pilot conducted in Europe. “By prioritizing real customer needs, security, and ease of use, ING was able to develop a bespoke customer support tool that gives users the best possible experience,” says ING chief operating officer Marnix van Stiphout. The Impact At the forefront of gen AI applications in banking When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers. “When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers,” says McKinsey senior partner and co-leader of the Global Banking and Securities Practice Stephanie Hauser . As part of a broader effort, ING focused on capability building across more than 50 support functions – in the Risk department, Contact Center department, and Analytics Office and Technology – giving ING a lighthouse case to more broadly scale their gen AI efforts. Working together, the ING and McKinsey team created a path to double performance of the chatbot in the next six months, build a scalable model that can be extended to all other ING countries, and setup a technical foundation for ING to address a wide set of gen AI use-cases across the Group. The efforts helped define a blueprint to scale across ten markets with the potential to impact more than 37 million customers across 40 countries. “This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry,” says Bahadir Yilmaz, ING Chief Analytics Officer. “Gen AI technology will further evolve and we feel well-positioned to leverage those developments in order to offer the customer the best experience and remain a technology leader in our industry.” Lessons Learned Let’s connect Andrea Del Miglio Senior PartnerMilan Carlo Giovine PartnerLondon Stephanie Hauser Senior PartnerLondon Mohcine Ouass PartnerAmsterdam Niels Van der Wildt PartnerLondon Related Generative AI QuantumBlack Labs", "summary": "ING, in collaboration with McKinsey, has developed a generative AI chatbot to enhance customer support, addressing the limitations of traditional chatbots.

It oversees a vast network of passenger airlines and aviation service companies. 2023 ESG Report: Accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth for all Up until 2022, Lufthansa housed its data across 14 separate ERP applications. This meant that their spend management solution was able to provide an overview at a high level. The company recognized that if they could gain more transparency across these data sources, they would be able to identify actionable spend insights at more granular levels across the organization. Lufthansa wanted to track more accurately what they were sourcing and paying for; this would open a channel to strengthen their procurement strategies, help identify more savings, and better understand their carbon footprint. “Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems,” says Holger Koenig, enterprise architect for Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “We wanted to break down data silos, simplify the delivery of trusted data faster across all our systems, and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources.” In 2022, leaders began working with McKinsey on a SaaS solution. It would need to play well with their own implementation of SAP’s Business Technology Platform (BTP) and translate siloed data streams into a consolidated, global view of procurement spend. It was called Spendscape. The Solution A fully integrated SaaS software Spendscape provides a comprehensive understanding of procurement spending. McKinsey adapted it to integrate with SAP’s BTP to enable data and analytics-driven management and create holistic visibility across the supply chain. Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems. We wanted to break down data silos... and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources. “Sophisticated organizations require superior data and insights for decision making. Procurement has gotten significantly more complex with carbon emission targets, managing supply risk, and inflation and deflation factors coming into play,” says McKinsey partner Björn-Uwe Mercker . “We now have a lot of volatility in the market, which drives the need for a super-fast reaction time. To do this, you need a data model and analytics that can keep up.” Fully integrating the Spendscape SaaS software onto SAP’s platform would create a 360-degree view of Lufthansa’s procurement performance. First implemented at Lufthansa Technik, a business focused on maintenance and repair of aircraft, and now being rolled out across the group, the tool is creating greater spend transparency across sourcing systems, simplifying data integration processes, and informing supplier negotiations to help reduce costs. For example, future purchasing decisions could be made using not just a full picture of external costs and spending across the value chain but also with the added layers of near-real-time data on price volatility and carbon emissions -- leading to smarter decision making and procurement across the board. Once fully realized across the group, the successful implementation of this tool could have far-reaching implications. It will provide better metrics across operations, including risk analytics, supplier negotiation, working capital, monitoring of material cost and procurement performance, among other areas. “With Spendscape, we aspire to build one comprehensive spend analytics platform for Lufthansa, fully embedding it into our IT architecture strategy,” says Lennart May, senior director procurement, Lufthansa Group. “This will deliver actionable insights and be integrated with future systems.” This reduces the number of tech components they need to use on the backend and allows for a solution that’s fast and scalable for future systems. The Impact Optimizing cost and carbon reduction decisions Spendscape has already uncovered actionable spend insights for Lufthansa Technik, where it was first deployed. It has also made it easier to collaborate across business units and provided a tool for data model changes and near-real time cash position management. The impact goes beyond financial and operational improvements. With the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive taking effect at the start of 2024, Lufthansa also needs to strengthen and prioritize capabilities and transparency around upstream Scope 3 emissions reporting. Spendscape unites procurement data from more than ten ERP systems into a single taxonomy. The result is a searchable source of truth combining information on carbon footprint across categories, down to the consumption and invoice level. This made it possible for Lufthansa to create comprehensive Scope 3 emissions transparency and collaborate more effectively with suppliers to improve reporting accuracy and optimize decisions for both carbon reduction and cost savings. “This is one of the more sophisticated use cases that goes well beyond classic spend reporting ,” says Björn. “Spendscape’s ability to create more transparency around Scope 3 emissions shows just how powerful a sophisticated data landscape can be in transforming the way businesses are run.” Related case studies McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation Building a next-generation carbon platform to accelerate the path to net zero Let’s connect Björn-Uwe Mercker PartnerMunich", "summary": "Lufthansa is leveraging Spendscape, a SaaS solution integrated with SAP's BTP, to consolidate procurement data from multiple ERP systems.

A growing number of companies with long-term carbon reduction strategies are turning to carbon credits to hold themselves accountable for their more immediate carbon footprint. As a result, demand is expected to increase 15-fold by 2030 and 100-fold by 2050, according to the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets , a private-sector-led initiative informed by McKinsey knowledge and advisory support. Within the next decade, the overall market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth upwards of $50 billion. And yet, the process for identifying, vetting, buying, and managing carbon credits around the world has proven labor-intensive and hard to scale for many companies. It often requires them to conduct their own due diligence for each project they consider funding. This nascent market includes an evolving and often subjective definition of quality, varying degrees of carbon removal permanence, lack of price transparency, and uncalculated risk. Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants. In the face of such growing demand and complexity, the private equity firm and global alternative asset manager TPG saw the need for a more sophisticated approach to accessing carbon markets. Leadership at TPG Rise Climate, TPG’s dedicated climate-focused private equity fund, saw an opportunity to leverage the tools of more mature markets—diversification, active management, and risk management—to address barriers to scaling efficient voluntary carbon markets. They partnered with McKinsey to build a new platform that would fill critical gaps in the market. What’s behind a Rubicon Carbon Tonne? Rubicon Carbon creates diversified portfolios of high-quality carbon credits called Rubicon Carbon Tonnes or RCTs. These portfolios are offered as curated baskets of credits or can be customized to fit a company's net-zero plan. The RCT is designed to reduce risks and increase options for climate-ambitious corporate buyers. Rubicon Carbon offers three curated RCT portfolios: nature-based emissions avoidance and reductions, industrial emissions reductions, and carbon removal. The RCT uses the tools, logic, and lessons of finance to enable companies to invest safely in carbon credits. “Rubicon Carbon constructs and oversees collections of high-quality carbon credits that have gone through a professional vetting process and are monitored on an ongoing basis,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane. “Their model essentially provides carbon credits as a service, allowing their customers to seamlessly access market-leading capabilities and tools.” “Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane . “TPG and McKinsey asked: How can we partner to build the next generation carbon platform and do it fast enough to create a market leader in a rapidly evolving space?” McKinsey worked with TPG to create Rubicon Carbon , an easy-to-use, transparent, enterprise-grade digital platform that offers innovative, high-quality corporate carbon products at scale in order to accelerate global sustainability and carbon removal. From idea to impact The Solution An innovative risk-adjusted carbon credit portfolio Over the course of less than 12 months, we worked alongside TPG to build and launch the Rubicon Carbon platform, applying a real capital markets approach to innovation in carbon markets. This included market research and segmentation, developing the business and product concept, using Leap business building strategies , business planning and execution, and helping secure sponsor launch funding. The work centered on establishing Rubicon Carbon as an enterprise-grade partner that brings sophisticated capabilities to corporate customers so that they don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every carbon credit transaction. Priorities to get there included coming up with a science-based approach to identifying high-quality credits, vetting the numerous attributes that drive quality and value to customers, and navigating the shifting landscape of risks in the market by actively managing baskets of credits over their life cycle. “Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time,” says Rubicon Carbon chief science officer Dr. Jennifer Jenkins. “By including a diversified portfolio of carbon projects, applying rigorous quality guardrails, and conducting ongoing monitoring and risk adjustments, we’re able to lower the risk assumed by buyers.” Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here. Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors. Over the course of six months, our team helped co-create a tech infrastructure and platform that integrated transaction management, carbon credit custody, customer portfolio management, and full enterprise technology architecture. The work included corporate onboarding and accounted for the necessary compliance features along with bespoke carbon credit purchasing and inventory management. “Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here,” says McKinsey associate partner Charles Riesenberg. “Previously, buyers in the market had to find and diligence individual carbon credit projects in different parts of the world, which creates an incredibly complex market.  Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors.” The Impact Connecting companies to meaningful climate projects TPG and Rubicon Carbon accelerated the platform’s time to market and customer acquisition over the course of six months. In addition to overseeing the asset management platform build, McKinsey helped refine the product and offering strategy, designed initial product portfolios, and helped design the new company’s org structure. What began as 25 full-time employees, two MVP products, and a coalition of 15 corporate launch partners (including McKinsey), has now grown to become a market leader in next-generation carbon solutions including four distinct product offerings and a $1 billion capital mobilization goal. Rubicon Carbon has created a reliable way for companies with long-term carbon reduction goals to make a more immediate impact in offsetting their emissions. Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time. It's already making a difference around the world. For example, through one project alone, 150,000 hectares have been preserved in Borneo. Elsewhere, methane emissions are being cut in Bangladesh, and 5,000 acres in Africa are being reforested to expand the habitat for endangered gorillas. \"It’s clear that companies must reduce emissions within their value chain, but to balance remaining emissions that can't be eliminated right now, we also need to scale high-quality carbon credits,” says Rubicon Carbon CEO Thomas Montag. \"Rubicon Carbon helps direct corporate funds toward meaningful climate projects in need of capital and moves us closer to reaching the ambitious net zero goals our planet needs.\" Let’s Connect Sean Kane Charles Riesenberg Related case studies From farm to tablet: Building a new business to solve an old challenge Made in Africa: Catalyzing stronger, sustainable, and inclusive economies How a global components manufacturer built an ambitious carbon reduction roadmap", "summary": "TPG and McKinsey developed Rubicon Carbon, a platform providing diversified, high-quality carbon credit portfolios to help companies achieve net-zero goals.

While retail spaces must comply with ADA codes, once elements like moveable furniture and merchandise are added, accessibility can become limited. Starbucks is hoping to set an elevated standard of accessibility by going beyond ADA requirements to create spaces that make everyone feel welcome. With 16,000 stores in the U.S., the coffee giant knew it had a big opportunity to catalyze change for this large and diverse population. Starbucks wanted to make accessible design the rule rather than the exception for its customers and employees. “Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody,” says Katie Young, Starbucks SVP of Store Operations. “We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores.” Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores. In 2021, Starbucks began working with McKinsey to develop elements of inclusive store design to reduce friction for those with disabilities and support independence for all in any built retail environment. The work included understanding potential points of exclusion and creating guidelines – what Starbucks now calls the Inclusive Spaces Framework – to make spaces more accessible for persons with disabilities. “The entirety of this work was not just about building something that’s just specific to Starbucks,” says McKinsey partner Anne Kronschnabl. “They wanted to develop guidelines to help change the retail industry at large. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it.” The Solution Minimizing points of exclusion McKinsey worked with Starbucks to identify barriers that may exist for people with disabilities throughout the customer journey. Heatmaps showed pain points around entering the store, ordering, and navigating spaces like the drive-thru and restrooms. Then the team worked on ideating potential solutions to eliminate or minimize points of exclusion throughout those spaces. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it. One critical element of the approach was that persons with lived experiences were an integral part of the team, participating in every step of the work. “We were very intentional about who we had on our working team and made sure we had people representing different disability types involved in ideation and prioritization,” says Anne. “We made sure to have lots of involvement from individuals with lived experiences.” This led to a set of proposed changes such as wider spaces to allow easier access for wheelchair users, better signage in critical locations and at varying heights, and a variety of sound and lighting zones to accommodate varying sensory needs. Starbucks also wanted to focus on the employee experience. We looked at the employee journey and redesigned employee spaces with accessibility as a priority. More inclusive equipment was introduced, including a new drip brewer designed with a larger dial and visual and haptic feedback. The Impact A new set of accessibility guidelines In February of 2024, Starbucks opened its first retail space designed using this inclusive spaces framework in Washington, DC. It now plans to scale the design efforts across more stores. It’s a significant commitment. This year Starbucks plans to grow its U.S. footprint by around 4 percent, with plans to open around 600 new stores in addition to the existing 16,000 stores across the U.S. Growth plans will include the use of these new accessibility guidelines so that all newly built and renovated Starbucks company-operated stores in the U.S. will incorporate these more inclusive design elements. The retailer is also thinking beyond its own walls. Starbucks plans to share this inclusive design framework with other retailers and is standing up an Inclusive Spaces Coalition. The hope is that more retailers across the U.S. and beyond will use these learnings to make their built environments as inclusive as possible for customers and employees. “This framework defines how Starbucks will help expand independence, choice, and ease for all people across physical and digital spaces,\" says Starbucks CEO, and McKinsey alum, Laxman Narasimhan in a LinkedIn post . \"Developed alongside a diverse community of customers, partners, and accessibility experts, the framework will be open-source to help expand accessibility across the entire retail industry.\" Our People Anne Kronschnabl Becca Coggins Related case studies 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Protecting workers through award-winning design", "summary": "Starbucks is enhancing accessibility in its stores by developing an Inclusive Spaces Framework, aiming to set a new standard beyond ADA requirements.

This week, nonprofit Opportunity@Work and the Ad Council have launched a nationwide campaign to ‘ Tear the Paper Ceiling ’ and encourage employers to change hiring practices. McKinsey is providing pro bono support to the effort through data and analytics tools that enable recruiters to recognize STARs and their skills. “While companies scramble to find talent amid a perceived skills gap, many of their job postings have needlessly excluded half of the workers in the country who have the skills for higher-wage work,” says Byron Auguste , founder of Opportunity@Work and a former senior partner at McKinsey. “Companies like the ones we're proud to call partners in this effort—and those we hope will join—can lead the way by tapping into skilled talent from a far wider range of backgrounds.” McKinsey has driven extensive research on skills-based hiring and human capital , and built data-driven solutions that help employers implement new ways of screening for knowledge, skills, and capacity to learn. “A few years ago, we looked at many talent solutions in the market. There was a real risk of hard-wiring outdated notions of being a skilled worker,” says McKinsey partner Carolyn Pierce , who leads the technology team in the People and Organizational Performance practice . “Those systems gave little credit even to our own team members for skills learned on the job.” People & Organizational Performance: Equipping people and organizations to unleash sustained performance Carolyn and her team began collaborating with Opportunity@Work to prove the value and transferability of skills developed through work experience. “The Opportunity@Work team has done some incredible research that makes the business case for hiring STARs into today’s most in-demand jobs” says Carolyn. Our pro bono support will help make those insights more widely available to employers. “We increasingly hear from employers that they want to recruit from the STARs talent pool,” says Shad Ahmed, COO of Opportunity@Work. “But they need practical, data-driven tools to replace degree screens and hire STARs. The portal we are building with support from McKinsey will help employers identify which jobs should be open to STARs and help them source from this valuable talent pool. It’s a key part of our mission to create vital technology infrastructure wired for inclusion.” McKinsey is committed to tearing the ‘paper ceiling’ in our own hiring practices. “We have made significant investments to ensure that our own talent culture is both distinctive and inclusive, attracting and developing talent from a wide range of backgrounds,” says Katy George , senior partner and CHRO of McKinsey. “We are investing in more ways to recruit, hire, and grow STARs through a holistic approach that recognizes candidates’ skills and experience, problem-solving ability and intrinsic capabilities.” McKinsey’s technology organization is at the forefront of this effort, with many entry-level roles already open to STARs who have the necessary knowledge and skills. “We already have technologists at the firm—from entry-level through partner—who are STARs,” says Katy. “Our technology teams work on important and challenging problems, from helping organizations reduce their carbon footprint to improving worker safety. Our best path to solving these problems is to attract talented people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Our recruiting teams are actively working to make more STARs aware of these opportunities and encourage them to apply.” Creating more opportunities for STARs requires more than simply removing degree requirements from job descriptions. “We are scaling support for apprenticeships, bootcamps, and training programs to accelerate pathways for STARs into our firm” adds Katy. “The programs will help STAR talent build any additional skills needed for success at McKinsey and beyond.” There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential. We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up. Byron is hopeful that having McKinsey as a sponsor of this campaign will encourage more employers to change their talent practices. “A lot of organizations know that McKinsey is very data driven. It’s a strong signal that they are helping to build better ways to screen for talent and creating opportunities for STARs through their own hiring,” he says. Challenging the misconceptions associated with not having a college degree is key to helping more people tear through the paper ceiling. “Screening for a degree is one way to find people with skills and the capacity to learn—the problem is that you’re also screening for who had the right social and economic conditions in place to attend college,” says Carolyn. “There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential,” Carolyn adds. “We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up.” related No such thing as a dead-end job, new McKinsey research finds Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey is supporting the \"Tear the Paper Ceiling\" campaign to promote upward mobility for over 70 million skilled workers in the U.S. who lack degrees.

Scaling supply chains and infrastructure, developing analytics tools to assess climate risk, reskilling workers in highly carbon-dependent markets, and more will have a massive impact on our ability to stabilize global temperatures in line with the 1.5C-degree pathway. To help our clients reach their sustainability and broader ESG goals, we have launched Sustainability Academy , a capability-building program that helps organizations better equip their talent for the net zero transition. “Making our economic system more sustainable and more inclusive is an imperative that is felt by all types of stakeholders, from governments and regulators, to clients, suppliers, and end consumers,” says partner Pietro Sorrentino , who helps lead Sustainability Academy. “Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that: help companies accelerate change by supporting them in building new knowledge for their employees.” The program was designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy —our capability building center of excellence—and follows a simple approach: acquire, apply, and sustain. First, Sustainability Academy offers formal learning experiences to help talent acquire new knowledge and skills through practice and feedback. Second, teams apply these mindsets and capabilities in a real-world context, where impact materializes. Finally, we help organizations sustain new practices and habits to unlock lasting behavioral change. Sustainability Academy has launched with two foundational programs. Our Executive Masterclass kickstarts transformations by aligning senior executives with the mindsets and skills required to deliver their sustainability agendas. Sustainability Transformation Essentials, meanwhile, helps clients develop enterprise-wide awareness of core sustainability concepts, including the climate transition, solving the net-zero equation, and capturing new business opportunities. The program is already driving impact with clients. Recently, we partnered with a Fortune 500 company to accelerate their net-zero journey, helping them become an industry ESG leader. In this case, the client had articulated clear sustainability targets—including reaching net zero for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. But leaders needed to equip their teams with the practical skill sets needed to engage both internally and externally with stakeholders and suppliers. This is a common challenge: industry benchmarks show that in some sectors, nearly 100 percent of companies have defined and communicated sustainability strategies, but only 40 percent believe they have sufficient internal knowledge and capabilities to achieve their targets. Given that about 90 percent of our client’s emissions fell into Scope 3 (within the supply chain and not directly owned by the organization), equipping their talent with capabilities to engage their suppliers was particularly important. Sustainability Academy The company asked McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy to help their talent build the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they needed to engage with their suppliers to reduce emissions across the value chain. Together, we co-developed a multimodal journey—integrating fieldwork, digital learning, and live workshops—to help the client’s category managers prepare for conversations with suppliers. This journey looked at key emissions categories, such as distribution and logistics, identifying the sustainability opportunities to discuss with suppliers and internal stakeholders. It also provided modules on how to best lead the supplier discussions and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The same client also sought to increase spend with diverse companies by more than $1 billion across their tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We partnered with the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion team to create robust diversity programs and track against diversity targets. These efforts culminated in a virtual supplier summit with more than 200 suppliers and more than 1,000 internal and external attendees. Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that... These efforts delivered significant impact on both the sustainability and inclusion fronts. Supplier commitments to science-based targets increased by more than 50 percent from the baseline, and gains were made on supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion, with additional commitments on tier 2 reporting and identification of new business opportunities with tier 1 diverse suppliers. “Completing the online training modules, supported by the virtual forum sessions and open office hours, helped our client’s people build a fact-base for working with their suppliers, which enabled them to have productive conversations at the supplier summit,” says partner Maria Fernandez . “Today, this work is the foundation upon which their multi-year ESG transformation resides.” If your organization is interested in working with Sustainability Academy, please email us . related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey's Sustainability Academy aims to equip organizations with the skills needed for the net-zero transition.

Using profits from the beverage industry, Ohio formed a new entity—a first-of-its-kind, state-authorized non-profit—to stimulate economic growth through new industries: JobsOhio . Over the next decade, the state saw nearly one million jobs created or protected. McKinsey was a key early partner, helping develop JobsOhio’s growth plan that identified ten sectors with opportunities for employment, such as aerospace and aviation, healthcare, logistics and distribution, technology, and financial services. In 2010, Ohio ranked 49th for job growth rate in these ten sectors. By 2022, they ranked 20th in job growth rate and had added $13 billion in payroll. The state’s job creation was its best ever, but JobsOhio wanted to ensure its strategy would be effective going forward. In 2018, the initiative asked McKinsey to issue a report evaluating its performance. “JobsOhio was in a class by itself in terms of economic development organizations as far as dollars per job, attracting companies, capital investments, and more,” says Ben Safran , a partner at McKinsey who worked on the report. “But we also found it needed to address approaching headwinds in the broader macro economy.” Brendan Buescher , a McKinsey senior partner based in Cleveland, says the findings encouraged JobsOhio to think locally. “They were certainly performing well against comparable organizations,” says Brendan, “but we urged them to measure success against the needs of Ohioans.” The case for inclusive growth The report helped shape JobsOhio’s 2.0 strategy, which expanded its industry-focus to include a new emphasis on workforce, innovation, infrastructure and investment throughout the state. From this, JobsOhio developed Innovation Districts in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—, multi-organization partnerships plan to create 60,000 jobs and establishing Ohio as a global leader in healthcare, life sciences, and technology in these three regions. As the new strategy was getting off the ground, COVID-19 rocked the state’s economy. Partnering with McKinsey again, JobsOhio quickly created a strategy for the pandemic economy, leading to the launch of Ohio to Work . Designed for displaced workers, Ohio to Work offered skills assessments, career coaching, virtual career fairs, and connection with employers who had signed on to interview or hire workers from the program. Specifically, McKinsey helped JobsOhio develop a unique program for reskilling and upskilling for higher-tech jobs: JobsOhio paid for tuition costs for technical degrees, and enrollees gradually repaid JobsOhio through a marginal percentage of their income—if they got a job that paid a good wage. Those repaid funds are not kept by JobsOhio; instead, the organization invests them in the next cohort. The program has been a success. Its funds have continued to replenish because of the high employment rate of participants. “With this strategy, not only is Ohio coming back strong from COVID-19, but Ohioans have the opportunity to pursue new careers they might have never thought possible,” says Ben. “A woman who had been a back-office worker and lost her job is now a nurse assistant—a whole new, stable career that feels like a calling. There are many powerful stories like this.” As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years. Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Most recently, the decade of growth and economic investment in Ohio helped attract a new investment from Intel, which announced earlier this year that it would be opening a new chip manufacturing plant in Central Ohio . This huge project is the largest single private-sector company investment in the state. It will create 3,000 new jobs at the plant with an average salary of $135,000. “As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years,” says JP Nauseef , president & CEO of JobsOhio. “Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The turnaround of the state’s jobs growth, Ben adds, suggests a potential way forward for other challenging situations. “Their success has been a paradigm shift,” says Ben Safran. “They are a model for growth in a changing economy.” related Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story", "summary": "JobsOhio, established in 2011, has transformed Ohio's economy by creating nearly one million jobs through a focus on various sectors.

They had come to learn what would happen when they cranked the big mill up to a work rate that had never been tried. The possibility of causing problems at the mill weighed on everyone’s mind. The team members had initially resisted the idea of running the mill faster. They wanted to keep the stockpile of ore that feeds the mill from dropping below the minimum size they had long maintained. Their concern was that a too-small stockpile would hamper the mill’s performance. Whether the minimum stockpile size actually helped the mill run better was another matter. No one really knew for sure. Nor could the mill’s managers and staff say what would happen if the stockpile shrank to less than the traditional minimum. As the weeks went by, the copper-ore concentrating mill sustained a faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. What they did know is that a custom-built artificial-intelligence (AI) model, loaded with three years’ worth of operating data from the mill and programmed to look for operational tweaks that would boost output, kept saying copper production would rise if the mill were fed with more ore per minute. To the mill operators, that notion sounded logical enough—except that it didn’t account for the minimum stockpile size they had in mind. But the model didn’t know, or care, about minimum stockpile size or any of the mill operators’ other ideas about how the mill ought to be run. With permission from company executives, the crew members at the Bagdad site decided to turn up the pace of the mill as the model had suggested. They also prepared to ramp up mining and crushing activities so the stockpile of ore wouldn’t run out. At ten o’clock in the morning, a technician clicked a control on his computer screen to speed up the system of conveyor belts carrying chunks of ore from the crusher to the stockpile and from the stockpile to the mill. Everyone in the room kept watch on the 13 oversize monitors in the control room, which were lit up with readings from hundreds of performance sensors placed around the mill. The quantity of ore grinding through the mill rose. No warnings went up. Twelve hours passed. The mill held steady. Even when its stockpile of ore dipped below the usual minimum, the accelerated delivery of ore from the crusher and the mine allowed the mill to keep going. As the weeks went by, the mill sustained the faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. “That was the breakthrough we’d been looking for,” Justin Cross, the Bagdad site’s general manager, told us. “Once we started to run the mill at full speed, we knew we could get results from more of the recommendations that the model was making.” The ‘age of the operator’ The story of how Freeport-McMoRan learned to rely on an AI model as much as the intuition of veteran mining engineers and metallurgists might not raise eyebrows outside the tech industry. For mining companies, though, it illustrates a quiet but profound shift into an era we think of as the “age of the operator,” when the best-run businesses wring profits out of low-grade ore that miners would have waved off as waste just ten years ago. One mine where Freeport-McMoRan had been processing declining ore grades is Bagdad, a sprawling Arizona complex where prospectors staked their first claims in 1882. Bagdad’s reserves of higher-grade ore have been depleted for some time, but Freeport-McMoRan has sustained the mine’s production of copper by making various process improvements. By the end of 2017, executives believed that Bagdad had gotten as efficient as it could get with its existing equipment, so they reasoned that adding capacity would be the surest way to get even more copper out of the site. Early in 2018, they started planning a $200 million capital expansion of Bagdad’s ore-concentrating mill that would lift production by 20 percent. Copper prices were high at the time. The investment looked certain to pay off. Then copper prices dropped from a five-year peak of around $3.30 per pound in early June to $2.75 or so a month later. All of a sudden, investing $200 million to expand Bagdad no longer seemed practical. Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase the site’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Instead, Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase Bagdad’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Discovering improvements at an efficient mine wouldn’t be easy. But Freeport-McMoRan had plenty of high-quality information to study. Around ten years before, Bert Odinet, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief information officer, coordinated an effort to standardize the way that each site measures and reports its performance and to build a central data warehouse for storing those measurements. Several years later, maintenance teams lobbied for the installation of additional network equipment and performance sensors on the company’s trucks, power shovels, and stationary machines. The teams would manually download data from those sensors to the data warehouse so they could further sharpen their maintenance practices and improve the functioning of equipment. When wireless mesh networks became cost effective and reliable, Freeport-McMoRan installed them at all its sites. Now the company could capture and correlate second-by-second performance readings in the data warehouse, all in real time. “We learned things we’d have never predicted,” Odinet said. “That project taught us to be more receptive to what the data was telling us. And it gave us the confidence to try more complicated analyses.” With advanced analytics and AI techniques , Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of data it collected, identify even more operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in the field. Bagdad looked like a good proving ground for this method. The site is staffed with creative, open-minded engineers, metallurgists, and equipment operators who stood out at Freeport-McMoRan for their willingness to try new things. Their earlier efforts to enhance Bagdad’s metallurgical processes, for example, had resulted in higher copper recovery. And Cross, Bagdad’s general manager, was a natural tinkerer who liked to spend his free time outfitting his pickup truck for off-road use and milling mesquite logs into lumber for a house he planned to build himself. Since joining Freeport-McMoRan in 2006, Cross had led a series of projects to streamline operations at the company’s mines. Would you like to learn more about McKinsey Analytics ? It also helped that Bagdad’s operations were stable. With few equipment problems or process hiccups to straighten out, workers would have time to help increase copper production. Executives felt that promising opportunities to boost Bagdad’s production could be found in one part of the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, a noisy facility where huge milling machines and flotation cells bubbling with chemical solutions turn grapefruit-size rocks containing around 0.4 percent copper into a fine-ground mix of 25 percent copper and 75 percent rock. The mill’s technicians ran the facility strictly by the book, a set of operating instructions that Freeport-McMoRan engineers in Phoenix had developed. There had to be ways of building on those instructions that would better the mill’s performance. After talking things over with engineers and operations specialists from Bagdad and from headquarters, Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson and CFO Kathleen Quirk decided to let the crew at Bagdad work with McKinsey on a new kind of mining project: data mining in an agile way. Learning agile The project called for more than sophisticated data science. It also called for a new approach to solving tricky operational problems. “Usually when we run operational projects, we overengineer them. We test every conceivable scenario, build in safeguards, and do everything we can to ensure that a process change will result in an improvement before we make it,” Cross observed. “It’s a dependable way to get good results. But it takes a huge amount of time, effort, and capital investment.” McKinsey’s consultants reckoned that the crew at Bagdad might get better results, more quickly, by carrying out the analytics project differently. They introduced the idea of working under agile principles , which emphasize quick development of functional solutions that teams then improve, little by little, according to feedback from users. The general manager assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. Another essential feature of agile methods is face-to-face collaboration within well-rounded teams . Cross assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. The composition of the team allowed it to tap the expertise and account for the interests of each division of Bagdad that its work might affect. It also enabled the team to contend better with challenges that involved different divisions and couldn’t be solved by one division alone. The team’s agile approach was to work in “sprints”—two-week bouts of activity in which the team conceived a data-modeling function or operational change, tested it, and learned what would make it better. As improvements came to light, the team would add them to a backlog. Then it would plow through the items on the backlog in subsequent sprints, starting with the easiest, most beneficial tasks. For Bagdad’s crew members, this agile style of working wasn’t just different from business as usual. It represented a radical departure from the way they’d been doing things. “It took us a while to get comfortable with agile,” Cross said. “We had to let go of a lot of old habits.” McKinsey brought in agile coaches to help. The coaches explained the rudiments of agile —building a backlog, deciding what to accomplish in each sprint, holding morning meetings to agree on the work the crew would perform each day and to note any difficulties that might slow it down—but were mainly there\nto join the team’s activities and teach its members to work together in agile ways. Shannon Lijek, a McKinsey partner who specializes in helping organizations apply agile methods, was one of the coaches who came to help the Bagdad team get the hang of agile. “We’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” said McKinsey partner Shannon Lijek. “Agile can be tricky to adopt at first because it isn’t a process you can memorize. It’s a set of principles for minimizing wasted effort and getting more work done. And we’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” Lijek said. One way that Bagdad’s agile team cut out needless effort was by introducing solutions as soon as it had built “minimum viable products,” or MVPs, that were good enough to use, rather than laboring to perfect those products first. “If we’d built the model ourselves, we’d have tried to get it 100 percent right before doing anything with it,” Cross told us. “Shannon and the McKinsey coaches encouraged us to work with solutions that weren’t finished. They’d say, ‘You can get 60 percent of the improvement with an MVP, and that’s a lot. So just start using it. Then you can worry about making it better.’” Introducing AI and agile to mining operations: Lessons from Bagdad By Red Conger Freeport-McMoRan’s effort to increase copper production at Bagdad taught us a good deal about how to use agile methods and AI tools at our sites, where it can be difficult to alter accepted routines. Here are a few things we’re keeping in mind as we expand the use of agile and AI to more of Freeport-McMoRan’s operations: Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan. From predicting to optimizing Once the team Cross formed came together, it began investigating the possibility of improving the mill’s performance. The idea was to spend a month examining data from the mill for patterns that revealed potential improvements. If those improvements looked promising enough, the team would pursue them. Beginning in late June, the Bagdad team and data scientists from McKinsey built a machine-learning model to check whether the mill truly ran as efficiently as people believed. The model, a type of extreme gradient-boosting model, consisted of an ensemble of thousands of decision trees that had been engineered to include a great deal of metallurgical knowledge. The staff at Bagdad and Freeport-McMoRan’s central operations group believed all the ore entering the mill was of the same type. Consequently, they had defined a single “recipe” of lower and upper parameters for the mill’s 42 control settings: the mix of differently sized ore chunks being fed into the mill, the pH level in the flotation cells, and so on. But when the agile team at Bagdad ran the data from the mill’s performance sensors through its model, the members of the team learned something new. From the mill’s perspective, the mine was actually producing seven distinct types of ore. What’s more, the mill’s standard recipe for control settings didn’t match the properties of all those ore types. Ore containing more iron pyrite, for example, would yield more copper if the pH level in the flotation cells were set higher than the recipe prescribed. “Thinking about ore clusters in terms of data from the mill’s instruments, rather than classifications from traditional geology, was a major mind-set shift—and it opened up many new possibilities for improving performance,” said Sean Buckley, a McKinsey partner who led the analytics work. All told, the team’s analysis suggested that adjusting the mill’s controls to suit each of the seven ore types could increase copper production by 10 percent or more. That prospect convinced Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders to let the agile team at Bagdad build an AI model that would look at the ore coming into the mill and suggest control settings to heighten production of copper from that ore. Change that Matters Team members wrote algorithms to discern the connections among the ore type, the operational readings from the plant’s sensors, the amount of ore running through the mill, and the amount of copper recovered. Next, they developed more algorithms to predict the plant’s performance based on measurements from the sensors. After several weeks of development sprints, the team members had raised the accuracy of the model’s performance predictions to 96 percent—high enough to know that the model was properly interpreting the data streaming in from the mill’s sensors and relating it to the mill’s control settings. To determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, staff decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. The team then turned its attention from predicting performance to improving it. Staff began by asking a simple question that no one had asked in some time: What measure of performance do we want to optimize? For years, the team at Bagdad had oriented its decisions and activities toward particular targets for copper production and operating cost. That approach made a certain kind of sense. It meant that Bagdad consistently generated profits. Now, to determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, the team decided to establish a new mandate— maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. Cross and Cory Stevens, Freeport-McMoRan’s vice president of operational improvement, knew that maximizing production could lessen Bagdad’s performance in other areas. The mill’s recovery rate—the percentage of copper extracted from the ore—might drop. Or the whole operation could come to a halt for hours. Stevens went to other executives to explain that Bagdad’s experiment could be costly. The performance numbers they’d see for the next few months might be dismal, he warned. Nonetheless, the executives agreed with Stevens that if Bagdad could achieve the 10 percent increase in production that the model predicted, the short-term cost would be worth it. They gave him the go-ahead to try maximizing production. With that approval, Cross granted Bagdad’s staff the latitude to make operational changes that deviated from standard procedures and could cause the mill to miss its performance targets. Worker safety and equipment integrity were the only areas where no compromises or experiments would be allowed. Any other changes were fair game. A big breakthrough Over a series of iterations during the next month or so, the team conceived, tested, and refined algorithms that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend control settings to maximize copper output. The new algorithms, known as genetic algorithms, used the principles of natural selection to “evolve” settings that would produce the most copper, given a particular type of ore. By early September, the team had expanded the prediction model into an MVP of an optimization model, dubbed TROI, that was capable of issuing recommendations every 12 hours, once for each of the mill’s two daily shifts. When each new set of recommendations came out, the engineers, equipment operators, and metallurgists on the team would huddle and decide what do to with them. TROI was a work in progress, so its earliest recommendations weren’t entirely reliable. At every shift, metallurgists from Freeport-McMoRan and from McKinsey would study the model’s recommendations and question whether they were credible. Then the metallurgists would take note of the problem recommendations so the agile team could look into them. Some recommendations led the team members to discover flaws in TROI’s logic, which they added to their backlog and corrected in subsequent development sprints. Others indicated that the underlying performance data were faulty and prompted the team to look for fixes. “TROI helps us to improve the quality of our instrumentation and highlights sensors that need attention,” said Frank Ochoa, one of Bagdad’s process-control and instrumentation engineers. Most challenging were the model’s recommendations to depart from the operational recipe that the staff at Bagdad had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Most challenging were the recommendations to depart from the operational recipe the staff had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Gradually, as the team fine-tuned TROI, its recommendations became more plausible, and the staff at Bagdad began following them. Yet many of those recommendations resulted in slim performance gains,\nif any. Mid-October arrived. The team was nowhere close to the 10 percent production boost it thought possible. Cross and Stevens decided it was time to act on a weighty recommendation that no one was especially eager to try: speeding the flow of ore from the mine and the crusher to the mill. Cross asked the mine operators to redline their activities—and reassured them that they wouldn’t be blamed for spending more money or triggering operational breakdowns. The mine operators ramped up blasting, even though they had to use more explosives. They queued up trucks to carry rocks to the crushing plant, in violation of a long-standing directive to keep trucks from standing idle. They choke-fed the giant crusher with run-of-mine, or unprocessed, ore to find out how much it could handle. Finally, on October 19, the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate. Right away, copper production jumped 5 percent. TROI had helped the team unlock a record level of performance. Small gains add up Having achieved a major performance gain, Bagdad’s agile team turned to enhancing the model’s ability to recommend mill-control settings that would increase copper production. The agile team reviewed the data model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day and kept working through a backlog of upgrades. Within several weeks, the team had refined the model to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. TROI could already identify which type of ore was running through the mill at any moment. In the next round of sprints, the team added functions to account for other incoming operational data. Each time TROI recommended a set of control settings, the metallurgists at the plant would consider the recommendations, choose which ones to accept, and pass them to shift supervisors and operators, who would adjust the mill’s controls accordingly. Letting the metallurgists decide which recommendations to follow helped the agile team learn more quickly. Occasionally, the metallurgists applied settings that looked questionable just to find out whether they would work. And when the metallurgists rejected the recommended settings, they typed notes into the model to explain their decisions. “TROI doesn’t always give fully accurate recommendations, but it provides a new perspective on how to manage the plant and challenges our assumptions,” said Lulu Raymond, a senior metallurgist at Bagdad. All the while, sensors gauged the mill’s performance. The model’s machine-learning algorithms recorded which settings improved performance and which ones didn’t, and whether the recommendations were helping. The agile team reviewed the model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day, added items to the backlog of upgrades it planned to make, and kept working on those upgrades. By early December, the team had refined TROI to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. It wasn’t long before the metallurgists and mill operators began trying to outsmart TROI. They would monitor the type of ore passing into the mill, anticipate the control settings that the model might suggest, and apply those settings before the model made its twice-daily recommendations (later increased to every three hours). This became a kind of competition: Who can run the mill better than TROI would? Most important, the mill’s production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bagdad’s throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day—10 percent more than the previous quarter—while its copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point and its operations became more stable (exhibit). The following quarter, copper production at Bagdad went up yet again. Those gains should lift Bagdad’s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200 million capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex. We think this is just the beginning for Freeport-McMoRan. Having learned to maintain TROI during the project, the company’s metallurgists and data scientists now run the model themselves, without ongoing support from McKinsey. They study daily and weekly reports that compare the mill’s performance with TROI’s predictions, and they continue enhancing the model’s ability to make recommendations. Freeport-McMoRan executives have also sponsored the creation of a second agile team at Bagdad to test and make process improvements at the mine. This team, too, is working without help from McKinsey, using the agile methods that it learned on the mill project. At another one of Freeport-McMoRan’s Arizona copper mines, Morenci, managers have kicked off an agile and analytics effort like Bagdad’s. And the company will soon launch its most ambitious program of this kind at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in Peru with five times the capacity of Bagdad. The age of the operator is here, and Freeport-McMoRan is adapting to it with agile methods and AI tools. Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan.

But based on trends that have been reshaping other industries, competition in real estate has spread to another area: customer experience. How engaged, productive, comfortable, connected, and safe we feel in our physical environment matters, and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for significant changes in the real estate industry . Practically overnight, for example, physical distancing and the need for contactless interaction have magnified the importance of digital within real estate. Pioneers in the industry have been exploring ways to diversify sources of revenue, pursuing new digitally-enabled business models and focusing on tenant experience. The pandemic has made clear that those that haven’t yet made such investments in underlying capabilities and infrastructure will need to catch up quickly. Leap by McKinsey “The future of real estate is no longer about delivering four walls to tenants,” says RXR CEO Scott Rechler . “Instead, it’s about creating a unique, personalized customer experience that fosters meaningful interactions, collaboration, productivity. Delivering this will require a unique combination of capabilities that seamlessly integrate across the physical and digital realms.” The joint Leap-RXR team has built products and services for residents that enhance their living experiences. One innovation is a new RXR app that is anchored around a resident experience officer. Designed, created, and launched by the team, the app allows residents to manage elements of their personal lives, like moving into an apartment, and use digitally-enabled concierge services for services like housekeeping and grocery delivery. Tenants can also submit and manage maintenance requests through the platform and make rent payments seamlessly. The entire experience is powered by a robust data and analytics infrastructure that is uniquely tailored and personalized, and enables staff to manage buildings in a customer-centric way. “There’s a huge opportunity to get more use out of data that these digital products create,” says Vaibhav Gujral , a McKinsey partner. “We can uniquely personalize services and experiences to tenants based on information that is made available at the right place at the right time.” Real estate is no longer just about four walls and relying on location for value appreciation. On the commercial office side, RXR is implementing new technologies to help monitor energy efficiency and environmental conditions. As companies consider what office space will look like in the return to work after coronavirus, these capabilities have positioned RXR to move with agility. For instance, the infrastructure created by RXR with Leap’s support enabled the company to respond quickly to the coronavirus, including the launch of a new comprehensive, data-driven program initiative called RxWell. “Helping to ensure an environment that prioritizes safety and wellness is particularly important in light of the coronavirus,” Rechler adds. Leap, according to McKinsey partner Jennifer Kilian , is all about bringing start-up thinking to established organizations. “In this case, that meant working with RXR to build its digital muscle,” she says. Jennifer explains that for any business to change how it creates value for customers, a diverse set of skills is needed across design, data science, advanced analytics, and business. The Leap team helped RXR determine which new roles to create and hire for. After outlining the criteria, they sourced and filled positions like software developers, data scientists, and agile coaches to ensure that the capabilities would live on beyond the initial phases of the project. Through our partnership, the company has built proprietary digital capabilities which are especially unique in the real estate industry, which will enable the organization to move with speed and agility. Building new businesses: How incumbents use their advantages to accelerate growth “Digital solutions have democratized access to experiences and conveniences for individuals and companies,” says Clay Cowan , a McKinsey partner. As people have grown accustomed to digital experiences  like online banking, tele-health, or eCommerce for example, “they expect similar from the spaces in which they live, work, play, and shop.” “We see this work as a catalyst for the rest of the industry across geographies,” says Aditya Sanghvi , a McKinsey senior partner. “Our aspiration is for this to set a new standard and benchmark for how real estate developers, owners, and operators start to think creatively about how they can create better experiences for their customers.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Superheating can be tricky to get right. Steel reaches more than 1600 degrees Celsius during superheating, and the ideal temperature range spans only 15 degrees. If the steel comes out too hot, the equipment operators must slow the casting step. If the steel isn’t hot enough, it can “freeze” before it has been cast, which compromises its quality. The frontline operators at the secondary-metallurgy station were used to running the superheating process based on past experiences. They would consider prompts from control systems, which were loaded with standard formulas, and then decide what set points to apply so the steel temperature would end up in the target range. Most of the time, they heated two of every three batches of steel into the optimal range. That “strike rate” allowed them to complete 25 “heats” per day, but it also left room for improvement. Bringing the strike rate up to 85 percent or so would result in 28 to 30 heats per day, enough to boost throughput by roughly 8 to 12 percent, or 600 to 900 daily tons. The opportunity stood out to the plant managers, who had been given a mandate to improve the plant’s performance with advanced analytics. In early 2017, they devised a plan for building analytics models that would help frontline operators get better results from the superheating process and several other activities. Data scientists from Tata Steel and McKinsey used historical information from the plant to build and “train” a superheating-optimization model, which would examine real-time operational data and recommend process set points conducive to a higher strike rate. In addition, managers arranged for some employees to receive classroom training in data science, data engineering, and other advanced-analytics disciplines. At first, the superheating model proposed settings that consistently improved the strike rate. But as the mix of steel orders from customers began to differ from the mix of orders recorded in the model’s training data, the model started to generate faulty recommendations—which frontline operators ceased to follow. Employees who had gone through the classroom training tried to fix the model but found the problems too complex to correct using the basic skills they’d learned. Similar difficulties arose with the models being used elsewhere in the plant. Despite the setback, managers had seen how the advanced-analytics models reduced costs and raised output. Managers also realized that classroom training alone would not prepare employees to sustain those performance improvements. They concluded that the company would need to further cultivate employees’ analytics skills and transform their way of working. Their insight paid off. By building these capabilities, the plant would raise its performance to world-class levels and earn acclaim from the World Economic Forum in July 2019 as one of 44 Lighthouse sites that are leading in the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. What worked and what didn’t: Lessons from Kalinganagar’s analytics program Focus on business improvements, not technology improvements. Kalinganagar expanded its use of analytics quickly by targeting performance gains and building tech solutions to achieve them, rather than looking at available technologies and thinking of how to apply them. Develop analytics talent, instead of outsourcing it. When Kalinganagar’s first-wave analytics models needed updating, the plant didn’t have in-house specialists to fix them. Hands-on training enabled the plant to cultivate the analytics talent that it needed to scale up. Scale analytics to make it a part of everyone’s way of working. Moving beyond pilot projects produced enough value to convince holdouts to embrace working with analytics. Adoption also increased as frontline employees worked with specialists to create the tools and as managers recognized employees’ success using them. Preparing for analytics, well ahead of its time Tata Steel’s multiyear effort to develop analytics capabilities at the Kalinganagar plant can be traced to a decision that executives made in 2005, when the plant was first being designed and built. Analytics technologies were then years away from becoming readily applicable to businesses. Nevertheless, Tata Steel’s executives considered whether they should outfit the plant with instruments and sensors to monitor equipment and processes. Their decision was less clear-cut than it would have been today—remote-sensing equipment is now affordable and advanced analytics has been broadly adopted . But some executives and managers foresaw that spending money on data-collection gear would prove worthwhile, even though it wasn’t yet clear how the data would be used. Amit Kumar Chatterjee, the plant’s then-head of electrical maintenance, was among those pushing to make the early investment—and even he acknowledged that at the time, the potential applications for advanced analytics were undefined. “We didn’t have in mind how we’d use the data, except maybe for autonomous process controls. We were living in the world of physical science, where experience and equations matter most. Data science was not even on the horizon,” said Chatterjee. Even the makers of the plant’s machinery resisted adding instrumentation. “Still, we believed we should put on the sensors at that stage because we felt it would be a lot harder later on, when the uses for the data were known.” By the mid-2010s, the leaders of the Kalinganagar plant began looking closely at what they could do with the data the plant’s sensors were collecting. In 2015, T. V. Narendran, the managing director of Tata Steel, set out a $1 billion cost-optimization goal and called on the heads of the company’s plants to map a path toward that goal. One way of boosting performance, he suggested, was to do more with digital technology. Advances in hardware and data science had made it easier for companies to take big data sets, uncover patterns, and make predictions that could help them attain performance improvements. Leaders at Kalinganagar launched their own investigation into how the plant might apply data science. In 2016, they traveled to Germany and visited technology start-ups and large established companies to get a close look at what data science could do. Early the following year, the plant’s leaders resolved to start an advanced-analytics program at Kalinganagar. Beginning the analytics transformation Senior managers at Kalinganagar decided to try advanced analytics on several pilot projects. During a two-day workshop, managers and operations specialists worked with McKinsey experts to identify ten possible uses for analytics and selected three to focus on—one of which involved the superheating process in the plant’s secondary-metallurgy station. Managers wanted to create an advanced-analytics model that could assess conditions in the plant and calculate how much heat to apply during superheating so that the steel would emerge in the target temperature range. The team working on the superheating model sought to discern which variables were the most important determinants of the steel’s final temperature, and thereby learn how operators could improve the strike rate. They pulled together two years’ worth of operational data that had been generated by sensors or recorded manually in logbooks. Data scientists wrote algorithms to make connections among key factors: measures of the condition of the steel as it reached the secondary-metallurgy station, equipment settings that operators would adjust during the superheating cycle, and other settings that couldn’t be adjusted during a cycle but could be altered over time (such as the maximum rate of oxygen flow, capped by the equipment already in place). Preliminary results from several pilot projects convinced leaders at Tata Steel Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort. They laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve critical performance indicators and believed that analytics could help. After two weeks, the team had built a model capable of predicting, with 75 percent accuracy, whether a group of set-point recommendations would cause the molten steel to reach the casting station in the desired temperature range. The other two pilot-project teams built models of similar reliability. Although none of the models had yet been put to the test on the plant floor, the preliminary results convinced leaders at Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort and create models that employees would actually use. In September 2017, leaders laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve the plant’s critical performance indicators—energy consumption, throughput, quality, and yield—and believed that analytics could help . They chose to carry over the work on the superheating model to the first full phase of the project. Together, the five areas had the potential to enhance margins by $10 million annually. Ramping up As operations teams and analytics specialists built the phase-one models, leaders at Kalinganagar sponsored an effort to begin training some 130 employees—which comprised one-quarter of the managerial staff—in analytics. With McKinsey, the plant set up an introductory analytics academy , installed a 15-member faculty, and created 50-hour curricula for five roles: digital champion, project owner, business translator, data scientist, and data engineer. Students performed simple practice exercises in line with the duties dictated by their roles. Although the models from the first phase worked well for a time, they started to falter as conditions in the plant deviated from the conditions that the models had been optimized for. The employees who had been through the academy tried to fix the models but could not do so using the basic techniques they’d learned by that point. And they had yet to work as apprentices on analytics projects, which would have given them hands-on experience retraining models. They simply needed more real-world exposure to analytics. Challenges also arose as frontline operators tried to start working with the models. Shailendra Rai, the chief of blast-furnace operations at Kalinganagar, recalled that operators never became comfortable with a model that had been created to help improve the stability of the blast furnace: “Most people spend 20 or 30 years learning how to operate a blast furnace. They thought that the model would be this magical solution. When the initial output from the model didn’t match their beliefs, they couldn’t understand why. They weren’t convinced it would work. The buy-in wasn’t there.” Supporting an analytics transformation: A leader’s view by Rajiv Kumar After the first phase of the analytics transformation at Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, I saw that managers needed to put more emphasis on developing the capabilities of the plant’s workforce. I also recognized that I should make the transformation a top priority. This kind of transformation succeeds when everyone buys in—and for buy-in to develop, leaders must show they’ve bought in, too. To signal the transformation’s importance, I announced that Kalinganagar wouldn’t undertake any other big initiatives until the plant had developed the capabilities to build and deploy analytics solutions on its own. Consistency and stability are important in steelmaking, so changing the way we do things can be hard. I knew that if everyone’s attention was divided between multiple change initiatives, the analytics transformation would be more likely to slow down or stall out. I also began holding “skip-level meetings” with junior members of our workforce who were being trained as analytics specialists or learning to use analytics in frontline jobs. The analytics work wasn’t easy, so I wanted to hear firsthand about it, just as I do when I walk around the plant and talk to equipment operators and technicians. Having a feel for how things are going on the plant floor is important. Then, in the second phase of the transformation, I required managers from the plant to give updates on the analytics projects they were working on. All my questions went to Tata Steel employees as well. It was another way to reinforce the idea that analytics is part of how our plant now operates. Rajiv Kumar is vice president of operations for Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Doubling down on capabilities The model-building exercise confirmed what leaders at Kalinganagar had expected: that analytics could deliver significant and valuable performance improvements. It also convinced leaders to make further investments in employees’ capabilities so they could sustain the performance improvements and take analytics into other areas . In mid-2018, leaders chose to initiate a second phase of the program in which analytics specialists and frontline operators would develop and implement models to aid their decisions and receive hands-on training in analytics, with McKinsey’s help. For the team building the superheating model, analytics specialists from Tata Steel took a refresher course in the skills they’d studied at the academy. Then they were assigned to perform certain development tasks—augmenting the user interface, simplifying the database, retraining the model, deploying new modeling techniques and approaches—in collaboration with experienced practitioners from McKinsey. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists were assigned to perform development tasks in collaboration with experienced practitioners. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists also spent extra time working with the employees who controlled the superheating process at the secondary-metallurgy station. They asked more questions about the process to fine-tune the model. Specialists watched the operators at work and talked with them about ways of making the model easier to use. Operators cited numerous difficulties, from faulty computer hardware to clunky user interfaces, that the analytics team helped resolve. The analytics team explained how they had developed the model and how it worked, because they wanted operators to trust its recommendations. “All the employees at Kalinganagar had been trained to make decisions based on their experience. When problems happened, they would try to solve them with physical equations—put in raw materials and heat, get a certain output. They do look at data. But with data science, they can connect many more data points than we can with physical science. Even if they don’t have a physical equation to explain why something is happening, they can still figure it out with data. That was a new belief system that had to be built up,” said Chatterjee. After around six months, the superheating squad had built a model capable of recommending process set points that would raise the superheating strike rate to 90 percent. Now it was time for frontline operators to begin using the model on a regular basis. Managers kept track of who used the model and who didn’t and celebrated the accomplishments of the most devoted users. Employees went from following 60 percent of the model’s recommendations to following 85 percent in a couple of months. Taking analytics to scale When the second phase concluded, the plant’s leadership raised the bar once more. They called for a third phase, in which Tata Steel employees would select, lead, and deliver analytics projects related to each of the plant’s main areas: core processes, power, and utilities. McKinsey consultants would move into coaching roles on the employee-led project teams. To focus their efforts, these teams set improvement goals for more than 25 performance indicators, such as the daily tonnage of pig iron produced by the plant’s blast furnace. Because several of those indicators pertained to the superheating process, it again emerged as a priority for analytics work. The plant’s analytics specialists had learned enough about data science by then to take charge of the superheating model. They narrowed its target temperature range. They also added the ability to predict how much cooling would take place between the secondary-metallurgy station and the casting station. This helped operators manage the transfer better and increase throughput. Frontline operators followed the model’s recommendations even more closely. As a result, the superheating model produced the annual cost savings of $4 million that had been estimated at the outset of the analytics program. Comparable gains accrued elsewhere in the plant. For each of the 25-plus performance indicators, teams realized at least 80 percent of the targeted improvements. Their efforts yielded $70 million to $80 million of value and two to three percentage points of EBITDA 1 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. uplift. And in July 2019, the World Economic Forum announced that an independent panel of experts in the Fourth Industrial Revolution had recognized the Kalinganagar plant’s digital achievements as leading edge and named it a Lighthouse facility —making it the first such plant in India. Looking ahead The Kalinganagar plant now has a cohort of more than 30 analytics specialists, including data scientists and translators. The most experienced have become in-house instructors and coaches and are responsible for helping other colleagues learn new skills in data science, business-case development, and other key domains. With analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support. Analytics knowledge has also suffused the plant’s day-to-day work, changing the way that many employees solve problems. As Shailendra Rai, the head of blast-furnace operations, said, “If you talk to five blast furnace operators, they will have five different opinions about how to solve a problem. In a way, all five are correct—everyone’s speaking based on their own experience. But with analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support.” With these capabilities, managers have drawn up a slate of more than 20 additional use cases, and they are reinforcing the use of analytics where it’s already in place. For Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, analytics has become more than a tool for answering questions—it’s an integral part of the plant’s operations and culture.

When the 36th edition began in early March, the race’s defending champion, Emirates Team New Zealand, hit the water having utilized a new crewmember: an AI bot created by McKinsey. It turned out to be a winning combination. On March 17, the Kiwis successfully defended their title against the Italian challengers, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, winning their fourth America’s Cup. The America’s Cup has always been as much about technology and innovation as it is about sailing. Boat designs are governed by the competition’s “ Class Rule , ” which leaves small opportunities for design tweaks that might give one team an advantage over another. If brilliantly seized, those opportunities can translate into a shining race-day performance. Our goal was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. The Class Rule for this year’s race, published in March 2018, required the two competing teams to sail a 75-foot vessel. It’s not your typical sailboat. Hydrofoils fixed to the hull lift the entire craft out of the water, enabling it to reach speeds exceeding 60 mph, or 100 kph. Most importantly, the hydrofoils are one part of the boat where the Class Rule allowed for design modifications, which offered huge competitive advantages for the teams that got those modifications right. Doing so, according to McKinsey senior partner Brian Fox, required intensive testing—and lots of it. “Every boat in the America’s Cup is designed with a computer simulator,” says Brian, who sails competitively. “Whichever team has the best simulator, and uses it most effectively, gains the advantage.” In 2019, Emirates Team New Zealand partnered with McKinsey to begin an innovative project seeking that advantage. What they needed, they soon realized, was a new kind of crew member that could sail thousands of boats at a time. The answer to that call was an AI bot, or software robot, that could test new hydrofoil designs by sailing them on Emirates Team New Zealand’s simulator. Creating value beyond the hype The simulator had been key to the team’s victory in 2017; the sailors had used it to test new boat designs without having to actually build them. But that simulator required multiple team members using it simultaneously for it to work properly. This was a logistical challenge, given the sailors’ scheduled practices, travel, and competitions. “Our goal,” Brian explains, “was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. By developing an AI bot that could run the simulator by itself, we no longer had to manage around the sailors’ limited availability.” As a first step, the McKinsey team, which included colleagues from our analytics firm QuantumBlack , turned to the cloud. Over six-weeks, data, analytics, and machine-learning experts from Sydney, Melbourne, and London migrated New Zealand’s simulator and developed an infrastructure to run it in the cloud. Then our team used a new and innovative approach called deep reinforcement learning to essentially teach the AI bot how to become a professional sailor. The technique allowed the bot to learn dynamically and gain greater accuracy through continuous feedback. Nic Hohn , one of the key project leaders, explains. “When you start, the AI agent knows nothing and learns by trial and error using countless variables—wind speed, direction, adjustments to the 14 different sail and boat controls—and is refined again and again,” Nic says. “Since the bot keeps experimenting, if you coach it to learn in the right way, it compresses into hours what would take a human years to understand.” This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat. The work was highly technical, according to QuantumBlack’s chief scientist Jacomo Corbo, and it required  extensive innovation around the bot’s learning program. “At this point in the project, a lot of creative thinking had to be done to figure out the right learning models, how best to coach the bot, and the right guard rails and rewards to put into place.” The team also created a network that allowed multiple bots to share information as they each learned to sail. This was a critical breakthrough, as it allowed the individual bots to gain knowledge from their collective experience. Ultimately, there were a thousand bots running in parallel, learning from each other. “It's learning at a huge scale and it dramatically reduces the time and cost of the project,” says Nic. “That's the power of the cloud.” Within two weeks, the bot was sailing in a straight line, upwind and downwind. After mastering the basics, it graduated to more complex sailing maneuvers. The turning point came about eight weeks later, when the AI bot started beating the sailors in the simulator. At this point, the bot became the ideal way to test variations of the hydrofoils; it was more consistent and more scalable than the sailors, speeding the cycles of design iterations dramatically. “This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat,” observes Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and member of the QuantumBlack leadership team in Europe, who is also a world champion sailor. Soon, the sailors were learning maneuvers from the bot. “With such a steep development curve, accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable,” explains Oliver Fleming , an expert associate partner, “both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, the bot sped New Zealand’s design process by a factor of ten. The race’s outcome proves that reinforcement learning can be a transformational tool for process design, with potential applications across industries. “This has been one of the most complex deployments of deep reinforcement learning in the public cloud,” says Jacomo. “One way to think about the difficulty of the problem: game-tree complexity roughly tallies the size of the space one has to navigate while accounting for the set of possible game paths, or the sequence of decisions, that need to be taken. Go , which is an extremely complex board game, has a game-tree complexity of 170—our sailing problem has a game-tree complexity of nearly 2900.” Mastering such technical complexity, particularly in this application, has heightened this project’s excitement for everyone involved. “It is thrilling to be using technology and AI to master the wind and water and go as fast as you possibly can,” says Nic. “This is not sailing as we know it—it's much closer to flying a low-altitude aircraft.” To learn more about our work in AI, visit QuantumBlack .

Built by Facebook with help from Google, the cables could boost data capacity to southeast Asia’s largest economy by 70 percent. The project, which is still subject to government approval, would be a boon to Indonesia’s connected users, who are among the savviest in the region and beyond. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Today, the nation comprises the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in the world. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Telkomsel has been an engine of that growth. The world’s seventh-largest mobile operator and the largest in Southeast Asia, the mobile-communications provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable, inclusive digital economy for Indonesia’s nearly 200 million internet users. It has dramatically increased Indonesia’s broadband access, helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) digitize, and led the nation’s transition from 3G to 4G before becoming the first operator to launch 5G there in May 2021. Telkomsel has long recognized the value of continuous innovation. When it looked to ensure its platform would remain the primary way its customers engage with the world—and win a new generation of customers—the 26-year-old incumbent decided to embark on a big, bold transformation. A plan to transform The move wouldn’t be easy, but Telkomsel felt it had an obligation to its customers, who had come to rely on the provider’s ability to meet their digital demands. So the organization called on a cross-functional team of data-domain experts from QuantumBlack and venture builders, designers, and strategy consultants from Leap by McKinsey to initiate a large-scale digital program aimed at reinventing the way customers experience Telkomsel in daily life. As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel knew it had to engage and strengthen its relevance with Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer segment. The average data-hungry Gen Z consumer in Indonesia spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone, using it to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. The program was built on three core pillars. Telkomsel wanted to build a new data analytics platform to better understand its customers and drive personalization; create and launch new businesses to reach underserved consumers; and launch a new digital channel that would streamline and simplify the way customers engage with Telkomsel’s services. Understanding customers Telkomsel’s leaders knew that providing customers with the best products and services would require putting data to smart use. The company developed new analytics capabilities that allowed it to enhance customers’ experiences and start the journey toward hyper-personalizing its services. Telkomsel began by building a new platform that contains more than 9,000 data points for each consumer, which was fully modular and reusable across business units. This gave the company a single, near-real-time view of customer behavior that could be used to improve experience across the entire consumer journey, from marketing and customer service to network operations, back-office support, and more. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. They also moved from manual data uploads to automated data pipelines and quality checks, which improved data quality and speed, and enabled more accurate and faster decision-making. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. Every month, Telkomsel runs more than 50 analytical models, based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, to identify the right way to interact with their customers and offer them propositions that are most relevant to them. The move toward hyper-personalization has allowed Telkomsel to better tailor their offers for customers. Today, these services and offerings already account for 50 percent of the telco’s overall revenues. Creating value beyond the hype Launching new businesses As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel moved to engage and strengthen its relevance with new consumer segments. For instance, the company needed to enhance its relevance to those underserved by traditional home broadband infrastructure. They also wanted to reach Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer audience, which spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. In order to move at their desired speed, Telkomsel would need to launch new brands and value propositions, which would require them to embrace a different culture, agile ways of working, and a fit-for-purpose technological stack through new business-building. In the end, they launched two new brands. Orbit: Expanding connectivity for underserved segments Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. Even as Indonesia rapidly digitized, fixed broadband access was not uniform, with just 15 percent of households using it to get online. To provide wireless connectivity to those who lacked fixed broadband, Telkomsel built and launched a new business called Orbit, which provides customers with a home router that uses 4G mobile cellular services instead of fiber optics. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. It includes a mobile app to check usage, top up on data, and manage router settings, such as parental controls. Orbit has doubled its one-year customer acquisition goal, with more than 35 percent of customers joining from its referral program, a testament to its popularity and market demand. Today, Orbit is seeing 20 percent month-over-month growth. By.U: Reaching Generation Z Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. Telkomsel didn’t have the kind of brand association among the digital natives it wanted to serve and delight. A cross-functional team of product managers, customer design experts and venture builders developed, built, and launched by.U, an all-digital telco experience. The platform allows users to select a pre-paid SIM card that arrives at their doorstep, activate their number remotely, manage top-ups and quotas, make payments, and more. By.U was built at pace. The team created a series of social-media tests to observe click-through rates on certain features, which allowed the team to develop and tune the minimum-viable product quickly. When Telkomsel beta-launched the brand, they quickly had 30,000 customers join the waitlist. The brand reached its one-year customer acquisition goal in half that time. Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. And to help ensure innovation continued post-launch, the by.U team established an agile-organization structure. Simplifying and enhancing engagement The app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. The goal of Telkomsel’s third pillar could be simply stated: to make customers’ interactions with the company as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible. But it was complicated to achieve. Telkomsel already had a self-serve mobile app, and the team initially set out to make changes there to improve the customer journey. However, as customer expectations for what an app could do rose—digital payments and loyalty programs, for example—so did pressure on the app’s infrastructure. It soon became clear that there was more value to be had in starting fresh. Delivering a new app is always complex. In this case, a core technology transition to a micro-services-based architecture proved to be the unlock. It also meant shaping a rigorous product-development strategy and creating a new commercial strategy to encourage uptake. But it was all worth it. With the launch of the award-winning MyTelkomsel, the company was able to offer customers more transparency around their usage, going from SMS-triggered alerts to an immediate, real-time view, as well as provide personalized packages tailored to their needs. Customer experience around digital payments became seamless, while an ecosystem with digital-retail partners let Telkomsel customers redeem loyalty points for products. Elsewhere, gamification mechanics allowed customers to earn badges that qualified them for free data allowances. The app also enabled access to new digital services, including video and gaming, and easier access to e-payment options through services like LinkAja, GoPay, OVO, Dana, and ShopeePay. All of this meant serving customers in more dynamic, exciting, and tailored ways. Today the app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. All aboard: Recruiting digital talent to sustain innovation Telkomsel knew that technology was only one part of the transformation equation. Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform—no matter how powerful—would perform to potential or withstand technological evolution. They also saw the potential in this partnership to help cultivate digital skills in Indonesia’s workforce, strengthening a commitment to building a center of excellence for Indonesian digital talent. They launched a new, agile recruitment process to attract, onboard, and train 40+ of Indonesia’s strong digital talent across data science, software engineering, product ownership and UX design. This entailed a whole new talent management approach – reinventing employer branding, carving out career paths for new profiles like data engineers and translators, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling existing analytics professionals. Over the course of several months, Telkomsel hired candidates across 12 newly created digital and data analytics roles, and set up seven cross-functional agile squads to catalyze the adoption of new ways of working. The end-product was a data management platform and new businesses - made in Indonesia, for Indonesians, by Indonesians. Culture, capabilities, and resilience Inside the company, its most enduring returns may also be among its least tangible: An emerging culture of innovation and agility; new capabilities and competencies; a new confidence in taking bold leaps through new ventures; and a commitment to long-term, sustainable transformation. Such traits, for example, enabled Telkomsel to help its customers through COVID-19. They quickly ensured their customers had fully-remote, digital services at their fingertips, and they were able to offer new packages that were tailored to what their customers needed and could afford at any given time. The telco industry is essential to our modern economies, enabling nearly every facet of remote connectivity, from online meetings to e-commerce to telehealth. It’s a sector in which it can feel like there’s little room for failure—and perhaps not always enough room for innovation. Telkomsel’s story is proof that innovation is not just valuable but critical; and that it can pay off when an organization commits to transformation at every level. Its digital journey has touched the lives of hundreds of millions of Indonesians, through personalization at-scale to enhance the experience of all its customers, new brands tailored to its digital-first users, and a new app that adds convenience to customers’ daily lives.

Welders spend long hours on their feet and often work outside: on bridges, at race tracks, in oil fields, and other sites. Welding strains eyesight, the neck, and shoulders. Fumes are toxic and burns common. For 40 years, our Sweden-based design team has collaborated first with Speedglas and then with 3M to design, and continually improve, welding helmets. With every product cycle, the joint team started from scratch, reimagining and redesigning the helmets, with innovations that sometimes shifted the entire industry. Our partnership has helped to improve welders’ safety and comfort under dangerous and strenuous working conditions. It started in 1983 when a tiny company called Speedglas invented a new type of welding glass. It darkened automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc, freeing welders from having to constantly “nod” the shield up and down as they worked. Other innovations over the years included a device that pivots the shield up and back over the crown of the head, rather than resting at the forehead, easing neck pain. Internal padding that skirted pressure points, reducing headaches. A two-way fan system that improved breathability. A textile covering that captured stray glass crystals. A curved design for glass that extended peripheral vision. Our partnership has produced seven signature helmet designs, with accessories, which have won 11 international awards, including a 2021 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award , and are now sold in 60+ countries. But most importantly, our work together has helped to protect welders around the world . Our North Star How do you sustain a 40-year partnership and reinvent the same product in fresh, new ways, again and again? “From our first contact in the mid-80s, we realized that if we worked together we could do something exceptional for our end users: the welders,” reflects Anders Grönberg , the global portfolio leader of welding at 3M. An engineer and market economist by training, Anders has led the development of the helmets for 25+ years, since joining Speedglas in 1990, and then moving on to 3M when it bought the company in 2004. “This has been our common interest during all these years: That we fulfill their needs today and in the future. The fact that we have been successful has, of course, also strengthened the relationship.” When Speedglas was first invented, industries in Sweden were advanced when it came to personal protective equipment. “Organizations were very keen to take care of their users,” recalls Anders. “We got a lot of suggestions and improvements from welders. We took notes with paper and pen and would go back to the office, share the information, and it would grow from there.” “Our North Star has always been to do the research where the welders are most comfortable: at his or her welding bench,” explains Oskar Juhlin , a McKinsey Design alumnus who led the helmet design work from 1983 to 2019. “If you bring someone into a design workshop, office, or other synthetic area, they won’t be as straightforward as they would be in their own environment. We also welded in our own studios, so we could test out the designs ourselves .” Design matters We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design. Early on, it was a challenge to talk to welders about design; at the time it was typically understood to be a field concerned with aesthetics alone. “One guy told me ‘I don’t care about how it looks, as long as I like it,’” he remembers. “Many welders work on race cars. Well it was a different story when I said, ‘So it doesn’t matter what wheels you put on your car?’ Yes, it does! So, then design is important? We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design.” Over time, the customer base grew to include countries in Asia and the US, where customers were very interested in the helmet technologies and had ideas for improvements. “There were more regulatory requirements to fulfil, so user research expanded into a more formal system,” recalls Anders. “We also realized we had to look beyond the current moment and anticipate the welders’ future needs.” Today, a product road map guides the design planning from three to five years out, with the goal of introducing a new helmet model every two years. “The cycles are getting shorter as the technology is changing more quickly,” says Anders. How we work The typical product cycle begins with the R&D team at 3M presenting the newest technical capabilities to three our four McKinsey industrial designers.  Many have worked together for years. The designers will have a wish list of what they’d like it to look like, as well as new materials, textiles, and fabrics to consider. “You design the helmet with several design concepts, on paper, in computer, foam and clay models, exploring different shapes and trying out materials,” explains Emelie Hedén Edlund , a design director who specializes in color, materials, and finish —or CMF, as it’s known— and worked on the later models. “You touch it, feel it, and then you go back to the computer again. There is a lot of back-and-forth between digital and physical hands-on testing.” The design studio is located in a large converted missionary church in Stockholm, with workshops for sewing, foam and wood working, metal working, and welding. As the design phase unfolds, the joint teams meet in a series of workshops, sitting together for one or two days testing out new prototypes, splitting up to work separately and do homework, and then coming back together to validate new iterations. Then they go to the welders to try out the prototypes and confirm they are moving in the right direction. If so, they go on to the next stage: the critical step of ensuring that the helmet model can be manufactured in high volumes . Hans Nyström , associate design director at McKinsey, recalls one inspiring meeting. “The extended 3M team and our designers were at the table, discussing a very complicated prototype. And it was clear that it weighed too much. No one wanted to raise their hand and say ‘it’s my work that’s causing this.’”  On the spur of the moment, the McKinsey team proposed a workshop: to get tools and drills out, then and there, and find ways to cut the weight. Together the entire team looked at every component—drill a hole here, nip away material there. They lost ounces. “From that experience, we all saw a better way of working. By sharing the common goal, it changed the whole mindset of the team,” Emelie said. “It doesn’t feel like a client relationship, but like a partnership.” “It feels good to work with a partner who has so much trust,” says Hans. “3M has an appreciation of good design—we share that as a starting point. We complement each other skill-wise. They have the deep technical and mechanical expertise while we focus on the design and exterior surfaces. We are on the same software systems, so it’s a seamless integrated workflow. Together we share a wealth of knowledge.” Giving emotional resonance to a functional object Over the years, our designers have drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources including medieval knights, superheroes, ergonomics, and Chinese acupressure. But for many, the helmet model closest to their hearts is the 9000 launched in 1996. It was the first time user research had been incorporated into every step, and it was a major departure in design. The shape of the helmet morphed from a square mailbox into a mask that felt more like a natural extension of the wearer’s face. “The design team had a lot of discussions with the welders about the emotional aspects or character we wanted to express,” explains Hans. “It had to be very professional, powerful. Welders are very proud of their work–just think of the image of Rosie the Riveter, who was a welder. This was the heritage of the profession. If it were in a movie, the helmet would have to be fit for a hero knight on a black dragon.” Designers introduced a ridge down the middle of the helmet face to suggest the look of armor and expressed trust through open forehead lines and other facial nuances. The ‘line of sight’ is angled downward, focused on the hands—the work. This model also incorporated the ability to exhale through side vents. “At the time, they were actually put on mannequins in the windows of one of Stockholm’s finest department stores as a fashion item because they looked so cool,” recalls Emelie. “They went from being a very functional object to having an emotional element.” The helmet would be cited as an example of ‘futuristic’ design for the next ten years. After it was launched in 1996, the strikingly futuristic 3M Speedglas 9000 helmet was displayed on mannequins in the department store Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm. Breathing easier Three years later, the team introduced the Speedglas Adflo, an air-purifying respirator that circulated air to reduce heat and improve breathability. It was a fan attachment that fit snugly down the welder’s body, fastened with a belt at the waist. This tight profile reduced the risk of the welder getting snagged on the equipment. “It was a revolutionary change,” said Oskar. “All of the other fans on the market had a round filter attached to the back which looked like a mushroom. By 2014, we went to a trade show, and every fan on market had this tight, streamlined look—our design had moved the market.” Last year, 3M launched the G5-02 for highly precise TIG welding. The helmet holds the world’s first curved glass shield, a design that follows the shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This year, it won the Red Dot award with a Best of the Best distinction. Looking ahead, Oskar predicts: “The helmets will become almost like a second skin, with softer, high-tech materials rather than hard plastic which is bulky, uncomfortable, noisy. Shields are already connected to blue tooth so you can maneuver equipment with a phone; there will be developments with cameras and video, and radar may be used for detecting the target, rather than light.” The evening news While the awards and external praise are gratifying, some of the most satisfying recognition has come from welders themselves. “We have had many, many stories, but there are a couple that are more famous within 3M,” Anders says. “We had a welder here in Sweden who we were visiting at his work site. We had just introduced the respiratory protection together with the helmet. After a moment’s thought, he said that he liked the helmet now because he could actually watch the late news on television. Before he began using the respirator, he was so tired that he would fall asleep before the news had started. That was an indication to us that the product that we had supplied to the market was actually helping to improve our users’ quality of life. It is a huge motivation for all of the people in our company to continue working with this kind of product.” For Oskar, the ultimate recognition came with the futuristic 9100 series. “Some welders tattooed themselves with images of that shield,” says Oskar. “That says something about our design.” Related Practices Design | Operations | Technology Related Articles How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger How award-winning design is helping older adults live safely and with dignity at home", "summary": "For 40 years, a partnership between 3M and Sweden-based Speedglas has focused on enhancing welding helmet design for improved safety and comfort.

There appeared to be no solution. The complexity of the devices, whose supply chains comprise hundreds of specialized manufacturers scattered across the globe, made production surges seemingly impossible. “Italy wanted to order 4,000,” a European manufacturer told the paper, “but there’s not a chance.” Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, an effort was underway that would unite a group of optimists and problem solvers from Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, McKinsey, and an array of Vyaire’s suppliers. Together, they embarked on an ambitious quest to dramatically increase ventilator production, thereby giving medical professionals a chance to better care for critically ill patients. Before it was all said and done, the venture would put thousands of furloughed people back to work, stand up a new ventilator-manufacturing facility, and bolster links in far-flung supply chains on the way to hitting a production rate that would deliver nearly a years’ worth of ventilators every three days . “At Vyaire, we take pride in accepting and facing challenges that others might shy away from,” says Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal. “In this case, we achieved something others might not dare to imagine.” Beyond business as usual The history of mechanical ventilation goes back hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until the polio epidemics of the early 20th century that the devices were widely used. Among the most well-known was the Drinker respirator, or “iron lung,” which looked like a mini submarine and was powered by vacuum-cleaner motors. They’ve come a long way since then. Today, these devices are the size of a large briefcase and utilize multiple circuit boards, complex software, and hundreds of components to control things like air pressure, flow rate, oxygen level, humidity, and temperature. Their engineering has more in common with aerospace systems than with household appliances. Ventilators are much scarcer than either of those things, however, and the outbreak of COVID-19 introduced a vast and widening gulf between supply and demand. In April of 2020, for instance, a McKinsey team looking at global medical supplies estimated that there were about 23 ventilators per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the most plentiful supply. “In Africa,” says Miyu Toyoshima Galliart, a McKinsey associate partner, “the region with the lowest supply according to the analysis, the estimate was fewer than one [ventilator] per 100,000 people.” Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth “To call this extraordinary-demand scenario ‘unprecedented’ would be a gross understatement,” says McKinsey partner Ron Ritter, who helped lead the effort. “Nothing about ventilators—their supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, service, or support—was ever designed for anything like what happened with COVID-19.” Typical ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day. Vyaire’s production team suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Of course, Vyaire’s operations were built for typical demand—not the increased needs of a pandemic. Its usual ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day, which is a lot considering the complexity, quality-control requirements, and capital-asset value. (By comparison, the highest-demand commercial aircraft in modern history never once exceeded a production rate of 60 per month. While different in many ways, both are highly engineered capital assets.) In April of 2020, Vyaire’s main ventilator product line suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Making that number would require a ramp in production toward 700 units a day in a matter of weeks. “Our executive team heard the concern in the voices of colleagues in the field, who were speaking with clinicians and providers across the world,” says Tammy Noll, senior vice president and general manager of Vyaire’s ventilation franchise. “We knew immediately no amount of business-as-usual was going to work.” So, the company got to work on business-as- unusual . The first step was to maximize output at Vyaire’s Palm Springs, California plant. Joined by industrial engineers from a major auto manufacturer in North America, Vyaire and McKinsey teams worked to revalidate basic manufacturing numbers, dial-in labor, and machinery capacity. Stopwatches and toolboxes in hand, these experts did everything they could—timed process cycles, analyzed bottlenecks, reviewed floor layouts, tweaked machines, and more—to get the most out of the capacity they had at hand. “We started with a spreadsheet,” says Bhavuk Tandon, a McKinsey associate and member of the team walking the factory floor, “and we were conducting time studies on the floor, going through every cell, understanding all the lines and how they worked. We needed that information to help us understand what we had to do to build a facility that [would] give 30 times and more—fast.” Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations. The practice, Ron says, can be an effective first step during critical shortages. “Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations,” he explains. “Finding it normally produces a 20 to 30 percent boost in output right away.” Once the analysis was complete, Vyaire added shifts to the reoptimized line. The moves helped increase production by about threefold. It was a huge leap by industry standards, but well short of what it would take to begin meeting demand. To get there, the company would need to make an even bigger move—to the American heartland. An interview with Vyaire Medical CEO Gaurav Agarwal A new workforce, a new building With its Palm Springs plant running as hard as it could—yet still falling behind demand—Vyaire leaders began working hard to find more workers. “This was about finding an entire second workforce,” says David Marchand, now a McKinsey alum, who helped lead the project. “In a single product line, we needed an estimated 800 people: front-line operators, supervisors, process engineers, maintenance techs, security guards, department leads, site executives, warehouse staff, shipping departments, buyers—and they needed to know how to perform extremely well together, right away.” When needed immediately, a workforce like that can’t be hired incrementally. The only way to acquire one was to locate an intact team—which came from Spirit AeroSystems. The aerospace and medical-device industries may seem like strange bedfellows, but Spirit was the right partner for several reasons. Operationally, their people know industrialization, have high production standards, and operate complex supply chains. And in this case, given COVID-19’s impact on air travel, the company had people who were furloughed and more than ready to get back to work. We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world. This was clearly an international-security-level situation. But beyond that, it was Spirit’s culture that made them the perfect fit. According to Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile, “Spirit cultivates a ‘can be done,’ mission-oriented culture that has been built on accepting challenges.” This challenge tapped the company’s core values of transparency, collaboration, and inspiration, and it inspired the combined workforce of over 1000 employees. “We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world,” says Tom. “This was clearly an international-security-level situation.” To get the most out of this workforce, Vyaire looked beyond California in search of more production capacity. They found it 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, where Vyaire decided to open an additional ventilator plant. That may be easy to imagine, but it was hard to execute. Beyond a suitable 55,000 square-foot building, it took machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, quality control, assembly, testing facilities, and much more. Capacities for each manufacturing-process step had to be calculated. Several miles of copper, medical-grade oxygen gas-flow lines, electrical drops, and industrial-grade air compressors had to be installed. Data connectivity to handle huge test-protocol transactions with cloud-based legacy software needed to be set. Workstations, production tooling, and a range of fixtures had to be built or sourced and calibrated. Even basics like car parking for 200-person shifts, break rooms, badging, security, and fire-control had to be installed. Most critically, Vyaire and Spirit had to design and build workforce COVID-19 safety, including social-distancing fixtures, temperature screening, reporting, and testing protocols. “We were hyper focused on providing a safe environment for every single person who was about to work in that building,” says Noll. “We also knew the risk of outbreak in this facility carried added weight. Not only were we concerned about their health and that of their families, but we were also cognizant that the consequences of illness there would be felt by patients in need of these devices across the globe.” Vyaire and Spirit were now ready to chase a benchmark that, months prior, would’ve only existed in a company’s wildest dreams. All they needed now were enough parts to make it a reality. Supply-chain reaction Supply-chain operations make and deliver tangible aspects of our lives and create the fundamental material pathways in a functioning society. Unappreciated in normal times, they rush to the forefront in times of crisis, such as the great wars and most recently, COVID-19. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. During COVID-19, these suppliers were just as pressed as Vyaire. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. Much of their supply-chain expense sits among fasteners, precision-machined valves, resin-molded components, electronic circuits, batteries, and more. During COVID-19, the plants that manufacture these components were just as pressed as Vyaire. Versions of the same efficiency processes happening in Palm Springs and Wichita unfolded in hundreds of operations across the ventilator supply chain. The effectiveness of these moves was critical to boosting output, but they were harder for Vyaire to control. The suppliers medical-device manufacturers use were scattered globally. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they were often hit by competing demands. For example, an electronics manufacturer that makes medical-device circuit boards could see a wave of demand for virtual-work devices. Suppliers did their best to respond. Many found ways to ramp-up quickly and help get Vyaire and Spirit what they needed. Others lost adjacent demand and had capacity to spare. But in some cases, suppliers lost capacity or had exceedingly long lead times. The most critical of these situations—the ones whose projected output would limit the team’s target rate—were placed on a “red list.” Early on, the red list was long. “It was apparent that dozens of material sources might hold us back,” says Jenna Stauffer, a McKinsey engagement manager who worked on supply chains in the effort. Clearing the red list would require advanced intervention. A group comprising Vyaire’s most experienced buyers and manufacturing experts worked directly with suppliers to get specific information on process flows, bottleneck constraints, shipping delays, and the company’s own component constraints. In most cases, these interventions worked. But in extreme cases, teams cleared to travel during COVID-19 lockdown conditions worked directly with vendors on site. In one example, a European producer of pressure transducers emerged as a key constraint. Teams traveled to the plant, mapped the entire process flow, and installed IoT sensors on a key rate-determining step in a single day. The work provided live, digital tracking of actual production against the max potential rate, and it helped the site raise its output within 48 hours. The red list work was among the most relentless of the entire effort. It went on around the clock daily, as time zones rolled through the global night, demanding nonstop problem solving for months. The impossible made possible—by people If machines and technology were this effort’s arms and legs, people—many of whom have never met in person to this day—were its head and heart. They were united through a relentless drive to help, a product of the cultures at both Vyaire and Spirit, and they had the skills necessary to do so. “Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring,” says Catherine-Sophie Haigh, a McKinsey operations specialist who worked on the project. “Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity, and they trusted the teammate by their side—in many cases by their ‘virtual’ side.” Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring. Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity. This was especially evident around one of the initiative’s most critical moments. When it became clear that the Palm Springs plant would never have the capacity to hit rising target rates, and splitting focus between it and the Wichita plant was sapping energy, leaders decided to execute what became known as “lift and shift” to consolidate the entire operation under a single roof. This meant shutting down the key ventilator production lines in the California plant over a weekend, crating all production equipment, and moving it as quickly and safely as possible to Kansas. Given the stakes, the risk of losing equipment in transit, having it not restart, or suffering irreparable damage was frightening. “I’d done something like this on a smaller scale before,” says McKinsey partner Jonathan Tilley, who helped lead the effort. “It’s not plug and play. I was nervous, and we all knew what a loss in output meant for people who needed ventilators.” During removal, teams would video-record and catalogue every screw, bolt, and connector to help the receiving teams put it all back together. The transit process was scrutinized for weather conditions and other variables. The team even consulted a satellite manufacturer to learn about preventing vibration damage en route to the new facility. “This entire move was conceived, decided, and completed in less than ten days,” Jonathan adds. “By working together, we all pulled it off.” The “lift and shift” success turned out to be one proof point in a massive success story. As the project progressed into the fall of 2020, Vyaire’s global delivery of ventilators crossed 35,000, with peak rates of more than 600 per day sustained on one product line, with more than 1,000 across all. “I still remember when the call came across to join this effort,” says McKinsey senior expert and associate partner Phil Duncan, who helped lead the work. “It was one of those moments in your career when you know you’ve just got to do it. It was a little nerve-wracking at points. It was emotional and meaningful. We all have a ton of pride in this because we did the work together.” Ten lessons on supply-chain readiness. By Ron Ritter Vyaire and Spirit got so much right in this unprecedented effort. Here’s what we learned from them. There is tremendous gain in getting this ever more right, as Vyaire and Spirit have shown us. Routine cost and delivery performance can improve through everyday enhancements across the organization. Stronger, more confident, and better-prepared organizational talent will build lasting culture around a sense of purpose. More rigorous design standards and better supplier networks are better able to respond with resiliency, and the brand will be stronger and more credible in projecting to the market. In normal days, operations will deliver better, faster, cheaper, safer. In a crisis, it may make all the difference in a decisive response. At peak, Vyaire was producing more ventilators in three days than their entire 2019 output. Over 19,000 units were built in the Kansas factory in just over 12 weeks by Spirit’s workforce. Similar feats were accomplished at other plants around the world, including among thousands of component suppliers. “We all worked together to create a state-of-the-art ventilator-production operation, supply chain, logistics, and workforce in less than six weeks that sent critical devices to patients in need around the world,” says Spirit’s CEO Tom Gentile. “I could not be prouder of what we all have done.” Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal agrees. “Yes, it was bold, and daunting at times, but there was never a chance we weren’t going to stand up to this moment,” he says. “Patients and customers were counting on us and our collective teams to meet the challenge.” This particular moment may have passed, and critical-care ventilator demand has since eased, but according to McKinsey’s Ron Ritter, the campaign nevertheless stands as an epic industrial success: “It also says a lot about what organizations can do when they have the courage to face what feels like an impossible objective, and inspire their people to do the same.” Related Practice To learn more about how McKinsey helps organizations improve manufacturing, please visit our Operations website , where you can also gain insight into CEO leadership of operations, supply-chain resilience , and much more.", "summary": "In response to COVID-19, Vyaire Medical, in collaboration with Spirit AeroSystems and McKinsey, dramatically increased ventilator production from five to 600 units daily.

That was when Wayne Brown, the operations manager at the Vistra-owned Martin Lake Power Plant, built and deployed a heat rate optimizer (HRO). About Vistra and its emissions-reduction goals Vistra Corp. is the largest competitive power producer in the United States and operates power plants in 12 states with a capacity of more than 39,000 megawatts of electricity—enough to power nearly 20 million homes. Vistra has committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent by 2030 (against a 2010 baseline) and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve its goals, the business is increasing efficiency in all its power plants and transforming its generation fleet by retiring coal plants and investing in solar- and battery-energy storage, which includes the world’s largest grid-scale battery energy-storage facility. Vistra’s to path to net zero will also require it to grow its zero-carbon portfolio to more than 7000 megawatts by 2026. The “heat rate” is a measure of the thermal efficiency of the plant—the amount of fuel required for each unit of electricity produced. To reach the optimal heat rate, plant operators continuously monitor and tune hundreds of variables, or “set points” on things like steam temperatures, pressures, oxygen levels, and fan speeds. It’s a lot for any operator to get right 100 percent of the time—so Vistra thought AI could help. Partnering for innovation With this goal in mind, Wayne and his group worked together with a McKinsey team that included data scientists and machine learning engineers from QuantumBlack AI by McKinsey , to build a multilayered neural-network model—essentially an algorithm powered by AI that learns about the effects of complex nonlinear relationships. This model went through two years’ worth of data at the plant and learned which combination of external factors—such as temperature and humidity—and internal decisions, like set points that operators control, would optimize the algorithm and attain the best heat-rate efficiency at any point in time. Vistra team members provided continuous guidance about the intricacies of how the plant worked, and identified critical data sources from sensors, which helped McKinsey engineers refine the model, adding and removing variables to see how those changes affected the heat rate. Through this training process, and by introducing better data, the models “learned” to make ever more accurate predictions. When the models were accurate to 99 percent or higher and run through a rigorous set of real-world tests, a McKinsey team of machine learning engineers converted them into an AI-powered engine. This generated recommendations every 30 minutes for operators to improve the plant’s heat-rate efficiency. At a meeting with all of Vistra’s leaders to review the HRO, Lloyd Hughes, a seasoned operations manager at the company’s Odessa plant, said, “There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon.” There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon. With this kind of power at their fingertips, Wayne and his team could make better, more informed decisions. Acting on the HRO recommendations helped Martin Lake run more than two percent more efficiently after just three months in operation, resulting in $4.5 million per year in savings and 340,000 tons of carbon abated. This carbon reduction was the equivalent of taking 66,000 cars off the road. 1 Calculations based on “ Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References “, United States Environmental Protection Agency If that doesn’t sound like a lot, consider this: companies that build gas-fueled power plants invest millions of dollars in research and development over four to five years to achieve a one-percent improvement in power-generation efficiency. Vistra hit that improvement level in only one-twentieth the amount of time using the data and equipment it already had. 2 Calculations based on source material from “A Brief History of GE Gas Turbines”, Power , July 8, 2019, and Frequently asked questions, US Energy Information Administration, last reviewed September 20, 2021 Creating value beyond the hype Vistra has since rolled the HRO out to another 67 power-generation units across 26 plants, for an average one-percent improvement in efficiency, and more than $23 million in savings. Along with the other AI initiatives, these efforts have helped Vistra abate about 1.6 million tons of carbon per year, which is ten percent of its remaining 2030 carbon-reduction commitment. That’s equivalent to offsetting about 50 percent of what a 500-megawatt coal plant emits. What happened at Martin Lake has happened at dozens of Vistra’s other power plants, with more than 400 AI models (and counting) deployed across the company’s fleet to help operators make even better decisions. It also reflects a core trait of Vistra’s AI transformation, which is that it isn’t a story of one massive hit, but rather the story of dozens of meaningful improvements snowballing to deliver significant value in terms of accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth. It’s also the story of how an organization architected an approach to rapidly scale every successful AI solution across the entire business. And it’s a story of how a continuous improvement culture, combined with a powerful AI modeling capability, helped leaders and plant operators do their jobs better than ever before. With more than $60 million captured in about one year of work and another $40 million in progress, Vistra is well on its way to delivering against a roadmap of $250-$300 million in identified EBITDA and more than two million tons of carbon abatement per year. The AI-driven advances at Vistra have heralded a generational shift in the power sector in terms of improvements in efficiency, reliability, safety, and sustainability.\nIf the one-percent improvement in efficiency the HRO delivered across the fleet was carried across all coal- and gas-fired plants in the US electric-power generation industry, 15 million tons of carbon would be abated annually—the equivalent of decommissioning more than two large coal plants or planting about 37 million trees. 3 The tree equivalency is based on calculations derived from the “The global tree restoration potential” study, published in the journal Science, July 5, 2019. That means less fuel needed to deliver power to the hospitals, schools, and businesses that rely on it. AI has the potential to bring similar levels of improvement to renewables as well, making them a more cost-effective and attractive energy option. Turning points on the AI journey Healthy skepticism and a culture of favoring action over words at Vistra meant that the biggest hurdle in the AI journey wasn’t the technology: it was the people. Vistra leadership and operations managers needed to know what AI could do and be convinced it could really work. It was this ingrained culture of continuous improvement—alongside a highly competitive market and a commitment to sustainability—that convinced Vistra’s leadership they needed to give AI a chance. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Seeing real possibilities The first question was a relatively simple one: “How can AI help improve the way Vistra generates power?” Answers to that question bubbled over when 50 of Vistra’s top leaders came to a McKinsey-hosted workshop. In multiple sessions, experts explained how AI worked, walked through detailed case studies showing how other companies used analytics and AI to generate value and gave live demonstrations of technologies, including digitized workflows and machine learning. Leaders in analytics from various sectors—including Amazon, Falkonry, Element Analytics, and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, as well as G2VP from the venture-capital world—provided insights and examples of how AI works. “I saw an example of how a metallurgical plant was using AI to help its operators optimize set points and it clicked for me,” remembers Patrick “Cade” Hay, the plant manager for Vistra’s Lamar power plant. “I saw how I could translate that into helping me run my own plants more efficiently. This was my lightbulb moment.” Company leaders and plant managers poured over process flow sheets and engineering diagrams to determine pain points as well as opportunities. This exercise allowed them to focus first on finding where the value was, then secondly on what technologies were needed to deliver it. Many of the operations opportunities were around yield and energy optimization and predictive maintenance, which according to our research, were the top AI use cases for manufacturing industries . By the end of the session, Vistra had developed a strategy to develop a series of AI solutions that could capture $250-$300 million in potential EBITDA while helping the company achieve its 2030 emissions-reductions goals. Codeveloping the AI While the analysis looked promising, proving it in the field was what mattered. “If our plant managers aren’t bought in, then things don’t happen,” explained Barry Boswell, Vistra’s executive vice president of power-generation operations. “So, we said, ‘Let’s pick a leader who is knowledgeable and skeptical, because if we can win them over, we can get everyone.’” They picked Cade. Not only did he run a top-performing plant in terms of profitability, reliability, and heat rate, he had a reputation for telling it like it is—Barry trusted Cade to tell him whether or not the value potential in AI was real. When he approached Cade about testing out a proof of concept to optimize duct burners, he was intrigued but predictably skeptical. Cade saw the potential in AI but was interested in finding out if it could actually help in the field. Duct burners essentially work like afterburners in jet planes; they provide a surge of energy when needed. Operators use them as supplements to hit energy targets, which are known as their “dispatch point.” The issue is that powering duct burners uses more fuel than regular methods, so it’s more expensive, generates more carbon emissions, and increases the wear and tear on equipment. McKinsey subject matter experts, data scientists, and analytics translators from QuantumBlack worked closely with a team from Vistra comprised of power generation and process experts as well as front-line operators to understand how the plant works, what data was available from the sensors already in place, and what variables could be directed—like the fact that the number of cooling fans running could be controlled, while the ambient temperature couldn’t. Working together Denese Ray, operations shift supervisor for Vistra’s Coleto Creek power plant; Doug Richter, the shift supervisor at the same plant; and Muro Kaku, McKinsey analyst and data scientist, discuss how they worked together. Denese: “Every week, I’d bring in a different supervisor to join us for our check-in calls with McKinsey. In this way, Muro and the McKinsey team saw what we were dealing with. We really needed all our supervisors and their feedback to build the model so we could get the most from it.” Muro: “That really mattered. For example, when we first trialed the HRO at the Coleto Creek plant, the recommendations were frequently rejected by the operators. We didn’t know why. When we spoke with the operators, they told us about specific rejection reasons, such as the tool recommended increasing superheat temperature by 30 degrees in a 15-minute interval to maximize the heat rate, but it takes the plant longer to heat up, so they rejected the recommendation. We then added a constraint to the tool to keep the increase and decrease to five degrees in a 15-minute interval, which operators could achieve.” Doug: “During load changes [increase or decrease in power output], the parameters are changing constantly, so recommendations to increase air flow at that time were counterproductive. We worked with McKinsey to have the recommendations stop for 30 minutes while we were changing load until the plant was stable again.” Denese: “We were all pretty skeptical of the tool at first, but when we got to play with the heat rate optimizer and see how it worked, and how well McKinsey worked with us in the plant, we understood how it could help.” As the teams developed the models, plant operators reviewed recommendations to see what made sense, what other variables needed to be tested, and what kinds of recommendations the operators would find most helpful. By analyzing the effect of various inputs and set points on the plant—such as pressure and humidity, the angle of blades in the gas turbine, usage of inlet cooling technologies, and the age and performance of various components like filters and condensers—and running it through the model, the analysis was clear: overall duct-burner usage could be reduced by approximately 30 percent, which would result in the equivalent of $175,000 of yearly savings on fuel costs and wear and tear on the system, in addition to an abatement of about 4,700 tons of carbon per year. “We worked closely with the team from McKinsey to develop AI models that reflected the realities of how power plants operate,” said Cade, “and then when we saw the recommendations coming out of the AI tool, I saw how much real value there was.” Going for scale and adoption from the beginning Vistra’s leadership realized from the beginning that the only way to achieve their efficiency and carbon-abatement aspirations was to scale every solution. “We manage the Vistra fleet as one. If a plant is doing something that works, we want every plant to do it,” says Barry. “That’s what we’re built to do.” That realization led Vistra to invest in a five-part system to scale and sustain AI solutions. *** AI solution deep dive QuantumBlack’s Ayush Talwar, an expert associate partner, provides more details on the AI model development: What kind of models did you use? We used a range of models to fit the specific needs of the plant and the solution. These ranged from Bayesian regression models to deep-learning models. How did you choose which model to use? We wanted to find the right balance between model performance, meaning its accuracy; explainability, which describes relationships to the operators; the source richness, which refers to the amount of data available; potential actionability, or how many of the most important features in the model people can actually control; and maintainability, which will reduce need for more technical skills to maintain them. How would you compare the models you used to older ones? Our models were more accurate than previous models, and importantly, more actionable. We used a variety of metrics to measure model performance such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Our models typically achieved MAPEs of less than 1.5 percent. How did you build up your models? Each neural network model was made up of several layers with each layer containing batch normalization, dropout, and activation. We created cross validation and out-of-sample testing sets using time-based splits to prevent overfitting models. We added features based primarily on domain expertise. How did you turn models into tools operators could use? We used machine learning models to make accurate predictions of outcomes. We then wrapped meta-heuristic optimization algorithms around those models to generate recommendations that helped operators make decisions about how to run the plant better. The models were then embedded within the existing production workflows and deployed live in the operator room. Vistra’s story is far from finished. As Cade put it, “We’re just looking at the tip of the iceberg.” Vistra’s roadmap for 2022 and 2023 includes bringing AI to its rapidly growing renewables fleet of solar and batteries to optimize yield and reliability, among other initiatives. To help sustain this ambition, Vistra is building up its talent bench. In addition to hiring a small team of data scientists and engineers, Rachit has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas to offer basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in AI and analytics for Vistra employees. Some 70 people have already completed courses, including those reskilling from statistics to machine learning. Vistra has also built relationships with local colleges and universities to develop internship programs and work with students in capstone projects to identify top technical talent. “We can’t sit around and just do what we did yesterday to be ready for tomorrow,” Barry says. “We’ve seen enough to know what’s possible.” The authors would like to thank Wayne Brown, Rachit Gupta, Patrick “Cade” Hay, Lloyd Hughes, Denese Ray, and Doug Richter from Vistra Corp., and Richard Bates, Dan Hurley, Pablo Illuzzi, Nephi Johnson, Muro Kaku, Jay Kim, George Lederman, Abhay Prasanna, Noel Ramirez, and Ayush Talwar from McKinsey.

Three days earlier, Reina, 15 at the time, had acted on suicidal thoughts, and Kana spent nearly every hour since searching for mental health crisis resources for adolescents. Everyone told her the same thing: take her to the ER. Kana, who is now the director of brain health at the McKinsey Health Institute, is also a 25-year veteran in the behavioral health arena and knew the ER wouldn’t help her daughter—but there was no other option. The doctor recommended inpatient care, but no beds were available, so for three and a half days, Reina was confined to a glass-walled room under bright lights and constant surveillance, isolated from everyone except her mom, who slept in the hospital chair next to her as they waited for a bed to open up in the adolescent psych unit. “Sitting in an emergency room for days at a time, not being able to get the help your kid needs is devastating,” Kana says. “I had advocated for evidence-based mental health services throughout my career, yet couldn’t find them for my own child.” A growing behavioral health crisis Kana and Reina’s experience isn’t uncommon. In the United States, crises related to behavioral health, a term that refers to both mental and substance use disorders, have been on the rise for more than two decades—particularly among youth. Between 2009 and 2020, the United States saw a 30 percent increase in the national age-adjusted suicide rate. By winter of 2021 , the weekly rate of ER visits by adolescents who attempted suicide was 39 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the average rate for adolescent girls had increased 50 percent over the previous year. Despite these alarming numbers, community crisis-care resources remain limited. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline center, roughly 39 million Americans aged 12 and older could benefit from having access to a service for vulnerable people dealing with suicide, mental health, or substance use issues. Limited crisis services mean law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and ERs end up responding to most behavioral health crises, regardless of whether the individual is a threat to public safety or in need of emergency care. “What we're doing now is services that are high cost and low efficacy,” says Kana. “It’s the wrong recipe.” Dr. John Palmieri is a senior medical advisor and the acting director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Behavioral Health Crisis Team , which includes the 988 Lifeline. He spent the early part of his clinical career working in emergency psychiatric departments and witnessed firsthand the misdirection of care and resources for those in behavioral health crisis. “You see the downstream effects of where the system fails in so many ways when you’re in those settings day after day,” he says. “How are we looking upstream to prevent these crisis situations from happening in the first place or recurring?” A hotline to help those in need The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, passed in 2020, made “988” the official nationwide three-digit behavioral health crisis number as of July 2022. This meant that, for the first time, those experiencing a behavioral health crisis anywhere in the country would only have to remember three digits to find the appropriate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline first launched in 2005 as a ten-digit number. At the time, Kana was working for the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA, which oversaw the number’s rollout. Over the years, she watched the Lifeline evolve, expanding to include options for Spanish language, veterans’ crises, and disaster distress help lines. “I've been along for the journey of the growth of the Lifeline and saw advocacy from the field trying to advance a three-digit calling number,” she says. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. The new easy-to-remember number, while hugely promising, raises at least one potential challenge. Call volume—rising over the years—has already begun skyrocketing since the new number launched. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. To help localities and stakeholders across the country prepare for this surge, the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), the firm's non-profit-generating entity that focuses on addressing public health challenges, has been involved in a range of nationwide efforts. This includes helping ensure states, contact centers, first responders, and community behavioral health providers know exactly what they need to meet demand—be it new strategies, workforce training, data infrastructure upgrades, or other support. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Defining effective crisis care In December 2020, MHI came together with a group of national behavioral health and crisis-care stakeholders for a series of working sessions organized by Vibrant Emotional Health , the not-for-profit administrator of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; RI International , a global organization focused on the design and delivery of behavioral health crisis services; and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) . The goal was to help prepare for the launch of 988. MHI began by listening to 911 managers, mental health and substance-use treatment providers, contact center operators, and first responders to develop a consensus around the critical dimensions of crisis care. MHI gathered input from participating partners on what critical elements of community-based crisis care were necessary for the delivery of the 988 Lifeline. These conversations helped establish a shared understanding among stakeholders around the priorities of community-based crisis care: ensuring that anyone in crisis has someone to call, someone to help, and a safe place to go, as envisioned in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care . Simple as it sounds, this involves developing a continuum of care that includes the 988 crisis line staffed by local workers who can provide information, deescalate crises, and—when in-person support is needed—connect people with nearby services and relevant resources. Had this kind of response existed in 2019, Kana and her daughter would have had a place to go besides the ER; one that might have provided appropriate care and helped ease already constrained hospital capacity. About the McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating global entity within McKinsey. MHI strives to catalyze actions across continents, sectors, and communities to achieve material improvements in health, adding years to life and life to years. Core to this aspiration is improving brain health. Brain disorders take a significant toll on both life expectancy and quality of life. In particular, the urgent and rising rate of mental health, substance use, and suicidal crises globally calls for a transformation of access to mobile crisis response and community-based crisis services. Through its foundational collaboration-based approach, MHI brings together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health. The result is meaningful impact on initiatives like the rollout of 988 in the United States and similar multistakeholder partnerships on crisis care around the world. Measuring costs and savings involved What would it take to ensure such crises are handled by trained professionals—including clinicians, peers, and other provider types—across a coordinated continuum of care in every community? To help answer this question, MHI began working with RI International in 2021 to build the Crisis Resource Need Calculator , a web-based cost calculator that allows local leaders to see a projection of annual behavioral health crisis care costs by county or state. The calculator enables them to understand the cost of providing for every individual in need of local, in-person crisis care based on SAMHSA’s national guidelines. It also considers how many mobile crisis teams states and counties would need, and what resources that would involve to build out to scale. The Crisis Resource Need Calculator also highlights potential healthcare savings available by making this shift in resources. Overall, the calculator estimates that with fully resourced community-based crisis systems in place, the United States could save a total of $34 billion in annual behavioral health costs otherwise spent on ER visits and inpatient beds. Helping build an action plan In addition to care costs, MHI also attempted to better assess responder readiness for the transition to 988. To do this, from November 2021 to March 2022, MHI partnered with state, federal, and local entities to develop detailed operational assessment playbooks to help key audiences, including states, tribes and territories, crisis contact operators, 911 centers, and behavioral health providers with understanding how they can prepare for the change. “The McKinsey team has been the glue that helped put this all together,” says Brian Hepburn, executive director of NASMHPD, which partnered with SAMHSA to prepare for 988’s 2022 rollout. “The effectiveness of the work is dependent on what happens between meetings, and McKinsey filled those gaps with needed data.” In March 2022, the 988 playbooks were released at a gathering of federal, state, and local stakeholders from across the field. They have since been shared with organizations like the National Council of State Legislators and the National Governors Association to help inform the efforts to scale 988. They’ve also been distributed by partners including the National Emergency Number Association , the National Association for State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors , and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing . Each playbook is geared toward a specific crisis-response group, including 911 professionals, Lifeline network contact centers, mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers, states, territories, and tribes. The playbooks were designed to help state and local leaders understand whether they’re properly staffed, funded, and prepared for 988 response and how to get there. “These playbooks offer stakeholders a self-assessment of their own readiness and links to specific recommendations and tools,” says Brian. Ensuring equitable care One of the ongoing challenges these playbooks attempt to tackle is creating equitable crisis care across communities. Ensuring underserved communities have their unique needs taken into consideration is one of the biggest challenges facing the current system, says Shelby Rowe, director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center . Shelby, a citizen of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma who has personally experienced suicidal episodes, sits on the board of RI International and advocates for marginalized groups and tribal communities to get access to the full spectrum of crisis care.\n“If you’re a 15-year-old black trans girl, your experience asking for help in Brooklyn, New York is going to be very different from your experience asking for help in rural Oklahoma,” she says. Creating a more equitable system requires including diverse voices of those with lived experiences and addressing the underlying challenges and limitations facing specific communities. For example, tribal boundaries don’t always align to state lines, which keeps tribal communities from accessing crisis resource funding; the needs of vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ youth; the lack of access to crisis response in remote rural communities; the struggles people of color face when attempting to find medical or crisis help, and the list goes on. “We have an opportunity and an obligation to build a truly equitable crisis response system,” says Shelby. Creating a sustainable model Today, crisis response and stabilization services are primarily funded by federal, state, and local governments. Many crisis contact centers are transitioning from trained volunteer workforces to paid specialized staff. Yet an equitable, fully resourced continuum requires sustainable funding and commitment to meet diverse needs across communities. To support this, MHI and its collaborators, NASMHPD and SAMHSA, are working on several ongoing efforts. This includes examining healthcare claims to better understand how crisis services are paid for, developing a tool to forecast the number of healthcare workers a state or community needs for crisis care, and developing models and strategies to lessen the burden on the crisis workforce. The idea is that state and local governments, payers, and providers can use these resources to better support the current workforce, focus workforce development efforts, and plan for long-term financial sustainability. “The McKinsey team’s expertise in analytics helped identify some of the root-cause factors driving workforce shortages and what financing models can impact this journey along the crisis treatment system,” says SAMHSA’s John Palmieri. Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives. It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. All of these moving parts come together to steer a broader plan of action for crisis care in the United States. The five-year vision put forth by SAMHSA includes the goal of having 90 percent or more of all 988 calls answered in-state by the end of 2023, up from 71 percent in 2020 , and providing 80 percent or more of individuals in the United States with access to mobile crisis response and local services in the next two to five years. “What’s missing today is widespread, community-based approaches to managing suicidality, mental health crises, and substance use crises both for adults and kids,” says Kana. “Those are the services communities need and getting them actually costs much less and produces better outcomes.” Including for people like Reina. Since the initial frightening 2019 episode, Kana and her daughter had several others before the family found support through a local county-run organization offering in-home counseling and support to kids and families in need. Reina has since become an advocate for crisis support for teenagers and started a not for profit in her community to raise awareness for suicide prevention and youth mental health. “Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives,” says Kana. “It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. It’s going take a lot of cross-sector collaboration to transform our nation’s response to behavioral health crises, and MHI is a committed partner along the way.” Related Articles Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z Addressing employee burnout: Are you solving the right problem?

In December 2019, just before the start of the global pandemic, leadership from ECU Worldwide began working with McKinsey to chart a plan for an ambitious transformation – an 18-month program called “Voyager.” The program would lead ECU Worldwide to a complete organizational overhaul that put in place leadership co-ordination and new technology that offered a better experience for their global workforce and customers. As a result, ECU Worldwide saw sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries and an overall doubling of earnings from 2018 to 2021. And they achieved all of this during a period of unprecedented disruption in their industry. The challenge ECU Worldwide operates a 4,500-person team out of more than 300 offices across the world, including offices in India, the United States, and Europe. These locations have accelerated growth into new markets. But they have also brought new challenges to operational cohesion. Locations were run as independent units rather than as parts of an interconnected global business. Sales teams traditionally focused on order fulfillment and issue resolution, rather than customer pipeline building; and in more mature markets, like Europe and the United States, resource utilization wasn’t optimized. Some locations were operating beyond capacity while others were being underutilized. Founder and chairman Shashi Kiran Shetty knew ECU Worldwide needed a new growth strategy. “We believed the company could do far more in terms of market share,” says Shashi. “We needed a digital strategy that would make us future-ready and help build the company into a global leader in the logistics industry.” The solution As the pandemic began upending the global logistics industry, ECU Worldwide worked with McKinsey to focus their goals into a resilient, long-term growth strategy that built operational cohesion and created digital solutions to give them a competitive advantage. “ECU Worldwide wanted a strategy that would make them future-ready and better integrate their people and operations around the world,” says McKinsey associate partner Chandan Kansal . “We helped them think through what organizational changes and digital solutions could make this happen.” Partner Neelesh Mundra leads McKinsey’s logistics work in India and co-leads our manufacturing and supply-chain work in Asia. “More than 50 colleagues from our offices across the world, and experts from our capabilities like McKinsey Digital , Implementation , and People & Organizational Performance , helped bring the best of our firm to this transformation,” he says. After an intensive diagnostic sprint, McKinsey and ECU Worldwide developed Voyager, a transformation plan that featured four central pillars: improving sales efficiency, transforming operations using analytics, optimizing the customer journey, and creating a future-ready organization. How it was done McKinsey helped the company identify more than 15 geographies across three major markets – Europe, Asia, and North America – that comprised the majority of ECU Worldwide’s overall business. The company looked closely at how sales teams in these regions worked with their customers, defined growth milestones, and conducted customer analyses to pinpoint specific country challenges and potential. ECU Worldwide then began working to strengthen connectivity among their sales teams. McKinsey helped build a coordination center that tracks KPIs, shipment movements, and sales and pricing across geographies. Decisions in different parts of the world could now be made and communicated across the organization in real-time, rather than taking several days or weeks to coordinate as they traditionally had. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth After the first 18 months, the growth strategy had been systematically put in place. It featured two major components. Technology transformation How tech enablement sets ECU Worldwide apart A big enabler of ECU Worldwide’s transformation was creating and streamlining centralized technologies that helped track what was happening across priority markets. Prior to this streamlining, data was often reported in different formats across different offices and might take several months to aggregate and review. The company worked with McKinsey to build automated management dashboards that gathered data from each market into a centralized center. A newly revamped customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360 , used data science to create a customer-centric experience. By onboarding new products and vendors onto the platform, ECU360 created a digital ecosystem spanning users across more than 80 countries, the largest of its kind. A complete organizational redesign ECU Worldwide’s focus then shifted to performance management, which the company led out of a new dedicated transformation office. “The important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization and institutionalization of best practices,” says Sanchita Mohanty, vice president of transformation for ECU Worldwide. “We had a detailed talent-value assessment identifying the key recruits we wanted for the organization to achieve the aspiration that we had set for ourselves.” The very important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization. The automated dashboards gave ECU Worldwide a framework for company-wide performance reviews. The company could now institute KPIs that were common across geographies and tied to the organization’s overall goals. With everyone looking at the same data, workers could see how they were a part of one global organization, working toward common objectives, rather than operating in silos. This impact was then sustained through a newly set up Data Science and Analytics Centre of Excellence. The impact The technology transformation created efficiencies across various areas of the business, improving ECU Worldwide’s resilience along with their visibility and control over cargo movements in the supply chain. The customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360, brought more customer insights to ECU Worldwide, resulting in a 25 percent increase in adoption and 90 percent customer retention rate. A new sales app helped increase productivity for the client workforce with more than 60 percent of bookings now done on ECU360. A yield management tool tracked value leakages and demand spikes, enabling teams to revamp sales strategies. And a redesigned sales accelerator app helped increase productivity by 150 percent. Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership. They implemented the rigor needed to move the organization in the way it needed to move. “This transformation program, Voyager, institutionalized a new way of working within the organization,” says Adarsh Hegde, joint managing director for ECU Worldwide. “Today if you talk to anybody in our offices in China, Germany, or India, you will find the same language being spoken by them.” While forwarders globally saw earnings growth during the pandemic due to demand bottlenecks, ECU Worldwide’s sales program was distinct in that it focused on volume growth specifically, which had been stagnant for several years. By focusing on key markets, ECU Worldwide’s transformation covered 80 percent of overall sales, resulting in sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries as well as sales growth from newly integrated less-than-container-load and trucking services in the past two years. Operations processing time was also reduced by 30 percent thanks to a model office playbook developed and deployed across more than ten countries to streamline operations and set up an ECU Worldwide way of working. Getting this strategy right has enabled the company to start exploring its next bold moves in air freight and cross-border ecommerce. “Bringing focus and drive was a common goal we all aspired for. We’d grown through many acquisitions and needed a common ECU way of doing business,” says Tim Tudor, CEO of ECU Worldwide. “Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership.

In fact, given Scope 3 emissions in their supply chains, manufacturing, transport, and construction are the most emission-heavy sectors in the world. Danfoss is one organization working to change that. One of the largest producers of component parts for heating and cooling, drives, and power solutions, the Nordic company’s net-zero transformation is helping manufacturers around the world green their supply chains. Would you like to learn more about our Sustainability Practice ? The opportunity With more than 42,000 employees across the world, Danfoss produces thousands of components each year. Used across manufacturing industries, these components find their way into countless technologies essential to keeping everyday life moving for people the world over. The company, says CEO Kim Fausing, has an opportunity to make a powerful environmental impact. “We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification,” says Kim. “We want to be the best-in-class preferred partner for customers looking to decarbonize and are taking our own medicine—continuously making the way we run our business more energy efficient.” We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification. Kim and Jürgen Fischer, president of Danfoss Climate Solutions began having high-level discussions with McKinsey in the summer of 2021 about how best to engage customers -- makers of equipment across these emission-heavy sectors who use Danfoss’s component parts – to become their preferred partner in decarbonization. The question at the center of those conversations: What should Danfoss’s decarbonization target be and how could the company make a realistic plan to meet it? Setting a course for net zero Danfoss’s Climate Solutions business is responsible for producing heating and cooling machinery components. Teaming up with McKinsey sustainability experts, Danfoss looked for ways to decarbonize various aspects of it. They learned that while the highest carbon emissions come from the use of products across their entire lifecycle, the second largest source of emissions lies in the materials and construction processes. Product redesign and an alternative supply chain offered two possible ways forward. “Material decarbonization is the next frontier for advanced industries,” says McKinsey partner Jacob Staun. “We helped Danfoss map out the complexity of their supply chains to identify sources of emission and design solutions with a positive impact on cost and carbon.” Innovating with technology To facilitate and accelerate the process, Danfoss, with the help of McKinsey, developed a digital platform that assesses carbon emissions along the entire supply chain of each product. This tool, called Zero Carbon Product, from McKinsey’s Catalyst Zero solution, mapped the company’s bill of materials for each product against a library of around 600 decarbonization levers spanning 100 material categories. The result was a cost-optimized decarbonization roadmap showing, for example, alternative suppliers for certain materials like iron, steel, and aluminum, that could help Danfoss create low-carbon versions of existing products still at low cost. Partnering for success The next step in the process was to test the roadmap’s likelihood of success. Pilot journeys were created for five products from Danfoss’s Climate Solutions portfolio. An assessment of these initial five products found that for a minimal increase in costs, emissions from materials purchased to make each product could be reduced by as much as 95 percent. Here was a clear path to eliminating most emissions at low cost. The program pinpointed exactly where reductions could be made and how – an assessment that took hours rather than days with traditional methods – thereby creating an opportunity to scale the solution across Danfoss’s large product line. At the same time, McKinsey conducted customer interviews to better understand the price elasticity of low-carbon products. This would help Danfoss determine which suppliers to team up with to pilot some of these new sustainable product line solutions. Building capabilities The next question was one of scale. Danfoss’s entire portfolio comprises hundreds of product lines, each with anywhere from tens to hundreds of product variances. While Danfoss has around 5,000 suppliers, McKinsey’s analysis found that around half of total embodied emissions came from just 50 of those suppliers. This created a shortlist to focus on to have the greatest impact. Danfoss worked with McKinsey to build new capabilities, including embedding carbon assessments into product engineering and retraining employees to add decarbonization to their procurement strategy. “Building lower carbon products requires an entirely new way of working, one that requires new skill sets and embedding carbon reduction into every business process including procurement, product design, and go-to-market,” says McKinsey associate partner Jessica Fan. Decarbonizing at scale This has helped Danfoss achieve the goal of assessing its entire Climate Solutions product portfolio by the end of 2022 to create a clear product engineering roadmap moving forward. And it’s become part of a broader set of Science Based Targets : by 2030, Danfoss aims to reduce all direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy by 46.2 percent; reduce emissions across the value chain by 15 percent; and become carbon neutral across its operations. By the end of 2021 into early 2022, training personnel at Danfoss in how to move this decarbonization process forward became a priority. McKinsey deployed a train-the-trainer model, arming around 20 key Danfoss employees with the skills and tools needed to train employees across the organization to carry out this decarbonization mission. Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance. This train-the-trainer process involved identifying key people, making sure they were included in the initial five pilots, then conducting trainings and workshops so they could own the rollout of this new tool. The next step involved taking a closer look at the overall product launch strategy. While the company started with the Climate Solutions segment of its business, the goal is to complete this same process across its other two business units: Power Solutions, which makes up half of the overall business and Power Electronics and Drives, which accounts for another 30 percent. Danfoss is currently working with McKinsey in the proof-of-concept stage for its Power Electronics and Drives business as part of a two-and-a-half-year plan to roll out low carbon products across the entirety of the business. “Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance,” says Kim. “Danfoss is fully committed to both having a positive climate impact and also helping our customers become more climate-friendly through their use of our products and solutions.” Related Articles Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation An AI power play: Fueling the next wave of innovation in the energy sector How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "Danfoss, a global components manufacturer, is implementing a carbon reduction roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions.

But there is opportunity here. Building new workforce capabilities can accelerate inclusive growth for national economies, increase socio-economic mobility among workers, and help organizations improve their financial and operational performance. Investing in upskilling and reskilling workers is urgent, yet the playbook for doing so is outdated and won’t meet the multiplying need. McKinsey’s recent reskilling capability-building work with a regional government department in Australia shows what’s possible—and what scale could look like. A global skills crisis A McKinsey Global Institute survey found that 87 percent of companies worldwide reported experiencing skill gaps now or are expecting to within the next five years, impacting productivity and competitiveness at corporate and national levels. Our analysis shows that Japan will need a 2.5 fold increase in productivity growth over the next decade to maintain its recent GDP-growth rate. And the Tech Council of Australia forecasts that its nation will fall 200,000 tech workers short of its 1.2 million target by 2030, with only 7 percent of the non-tech workforce having a strong skills match with tech occupations. Nearly all respondents to the McKinsey Global Institute survey identified closing skill gaps as a main concern, yet only one-third of respondents say their organizations are prepared to address potential role disruptions. Only 28 percent say their organizations make effective decisions on how to close skill gaps. Upskilling and reskilling today’s workforce—in non-degree, skill-building programs—is critical to attracting and retaining talent while driving market competitiveness. “Hiring alone will not meet future workforce demands,” says Rod Farmer, a McKinsey associate partner in Sydney and leader of customer experience and design work in Asia-Pacific for McKinsey Digital. “We’re rapidly moving from a job-based to a skills-based economy requiring more nimble, tech-savvy, and multi-disciplinary teams. We’re seeing significant skills gaps emerging across all sectors of the Australian labor market and broadly across Asia.” One organization that understands this is Australia’s Department of Regional New South Wales (DRNSW), a government department supporting regional communities through agriculture, local infrastructure projects, soil conservation, environmental stewardship, economic development, and more. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated DRNSW’s need for a future-ready workforce. With most employees based in remote areas, many observed an increased need for digital skills but had not received the necessary technological training prior to the pandemic. Increased reliance on digital and data skills became both a strain on the agency’s productivity and accelerated digital inclusivity challenges. Identifying needs, seeing new potential At the onset of the pandemic, DRNSW took stock of its employees’ digital capabilities. The department uncovered a range of digital literacy challenges, ranging from frontline workers relying on friends and colleagues for help with basic digital tasks, such as emails and timesheets, to more complex tasks involving spreadsheets, where increased skills mastery was now essential. We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting. “We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting,” says Donna Mcleod, acting chief people officer of DRNSW. “It was a shock. We had to figure out how to make a fundamental, baseline shift.” DRNSW had tried traditional learning approaches in the past, which fell short of shifting needs and operating models. It needed to move beyond employees learning on their own, separately from their work, which often leads to surface knowledge acquisition only. “We saw there was a major need here—an opportunity for innovation and new capability building models within DRNSW where we could support the people of New South Wales, while also tackling a larger national skills-gap challenge,” says Rod. Over the next 12 months, DRNSW and McKinsey built an enterprise Digital Skills Program, creating an entirely different reskilling engine at the heart of DRNSW. Reinventing skill building McKinsey and DRNSW began their journey by reframing the challenge. DRNSW took an applied skills development approach, focusing on the jobs-to-be-done. This shift meant an increased focus on employee-backed, context-dependent, and on-the-job skills development—solving real day-to-day people development and productivity needs. Core to the DRNSW approach was contextualized learning: the notion that skill development does not happen in a classroom but while employees are on the job, with direct apprenticeship where they are able to immediately operationalize it. Human-centered design resulted in a program informed by a deep study of the individual’s and organization’s needs and pain points, brought to life through ethnographic research across regional and rural New South Wales, addressed in small peer-based groups with individual coaching, and supported by short feedback cycles. “One of the universal pain points we observed was that it’s very difficult for people to make time for upskilling and reskilling beyond their day-to-day responsibilities,” says Donna. “It was important for us to develop a program that placed skill building at the core of their workday, supported by peers and mentors.” The new DRNSW Skills Program helps to identify the specific skills, competencies and proficiency levels required at an organizational level within DRNSW roles. The program then helps assess employee skills, develop tailored programs to close the gaps, and support individuals in their role through direct peer-led coaching. Furthermore, the program scales from shorter upskilling modules to larger reskilling programs to support lateral internal hiring. “We now measure skills readiness in months, not years,” says Rod, who led the DRNSW’s skills transformation. “This isn’t a yearly one-and-done type of problem. Organizations need to institute continuous reskilling and upskilling if they are to maintain future-ready workforces.” To achieve this skills transformation, McKinsey and DRNSW worked with Mentem by UNSW. A new, independent business launched and backed by the University of New South Wales, Mentem helps corporate businesses upskill and reskill their employees at scale through tailored on-the-job training. This collaboration also provided employees the potential to receive micro-credentialling through time spent learning on the job—enabling access to credentialled learning at a global top 50 higher-education institution. Building Mentem by UNSW, a reskilling business UNSW—like many top universities—recognized the opportunity to further extend its post-graduate services beyond its more traditional offerings. Importantly, it also recognized that this challenge required the university to develop new operating and service models that leveraged its unique assets and heritage in adult learning, whilst accelerating product innovation and industry collaboration. To help realise its ambitions, UNSW partnered with Leap by McKinsey (McKinsey’s venture building capability) who helped design, build and launch the new venture at pace. “We’d never have been able to independently build a blueprint for a business this fast—we did it in 12 weeks, which is unheard of at a university for something of this magnitude,” says Arvind. “Mentem exists to provide new educational models for employer and workforce needs in Australia and globally,” says Arvind Sampath, founding chief executive officer of Mentem. “Working with DRNSW was an exciting opportunity to leverage our knowledge and revitalize a government agency we all rely on.” Another core element of the DRNSW Digital Skills Program is the ‘skills hub,’ critical for engaging the broader DRNSW organization and ensuring sustained impact as the program scaled. This new operational unit consists of a DRNSW squad with capability building specialists, human-centered designers, instructional designers, and program delivery experts. To evaluate impact and prove the viability of scaling up the new program, Mentem developed a unique learning analytics platform that measured individual and cohort performance over time, leveraging learner management system analytics, project results, and coach feedback. The platform also provides automated interventions, or nudges, to individuals and coaches to drive program engagement and behavior change. Transformative results For DRNSW, the results exceeded expectations—and in record time—with over 90 percent employee satisfaction and 85 percent of participants reporting improved applied skills. The 8-week courses are now scaling across DRNSW. “Other agencies couldn’t believe we built, piloted and started scaling this entire new approach to capability building in six months when this can typically take two or three years in government,” Donna says. “It was a phenomenal delivery.” Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. These types of changes, scaled throughout the agency, increased productivity and delivered improved services for constituents. Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. The program has already been recognized for its impact and employee-centric approach, winning the Best in Class award in the public-sector category from Good Design Australia, one of the most prestigious design awards in the world. But the biggest testament to its success is the difference it made in the careers of the employees. “You have to realize, this has absolutely changed people’s lives,“ says Donna. Participants reported very high levels of increased confidence in performing their work, value from their coaches and overall satisfaction with the program. “The program was very different from anything I’ve done before,” says Charlene, who completed the program. “The coaching was my highlight of the week.” “To do these jobs, the way everything’s going digital, you need to upskill to get there,” says Glenn, another participant. “I thought, ‘wow, this program is for me.’” The stakes for DRNSW were high—delivering government services that drive value for citizens is essential. But for corporate institutions, it could very much be a question of survival. “If a government agency like DRNSW can make such a major shift with a traditionally non-digital workforce, then enterprises can meet the moment too.” says Roland Dillon, a partner with McKinsey’s Public & Social Sector practice based in Melbourne. “Not doing so could lead to an existential crisis as competitors not only leapfrog the market, but do so while taking talent that is hungry to learn and develop in an increasingly digital world.” Related Articles Future of  Work Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "A government agency in Australia, DRNSW, partnered with McKinsey to address a skills crisis by developing a Digital Skills Program focused on upskilling and reskilling employees.

Many of them shop at Makro, a well-known Thai wholesaler, to meet that demand. The global pandemic has highlighted the essential role these wholesale suppliers play in society—and the opportunity they have, to accelerate their own digital transformations, build new e-commerce capabilities, and better serve customers. When leaders at CP AXTRA Public Company Limited decided to make a digital transformation, they partnered with McKinsey to identify the right strategy, lead with technology, and ensure their transformation would endure. The opportunity The first B2B online platform of its kind Makro was only capturing 10 percent of buyers’ share of wallet. Their customers typically went to other suppliers, from smaller vegetable producers to wet markets, to fulfill their commercial needs. “That adds a lot of operational overhead for them, causing a lack of efficiency in running their businesses,” says Tirayu Songvetkasem, chief digital officer of CP AXTRA. The advent of the pandemic accelerated these challenges and helped create momentum to solve for this customer need. We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working. “Makro comes from a very classic business background,” says Paul Howe, group chief information officer of CP AXTRA . “We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working.” How it was done Building products, teams, and a trust-based relationship Leap by McKinsey experts partnered with CP AXTRA to build a new digital platform where business owners could access a real-time view of wholesale inventory from hundreds of suppliers in a single app. Known as Makro PRO, the platform offers streamlined goods-purchasing for hotels, restaurants, and cafes. “Building Makro PRO from scratch was a new experience for us. For the platform to be successful, we needed a very solid and future-ready technology stack and architecture,” says Yanawee Sarotnunjeen, a product owner at Makro PRO. “We worked with McKinsey to help us accelerate the technology build and make it secure and highly scalable. McKinsey brought in expert digital talent, including product builders and strategists, software engineers, data scientists and designers—and embedded them within our team. Today the technology that supports Makro PRO has been embedded into other parts of our organization.” As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth. After the initial build, CP AXTRA knew it had to build its own tech talent bench to sustain and scale the platform. “We worked with McKinsey to hire and build tech capabilities systematically across different roles and seniority levels,” says Yanawee. “In six months, we grew the Makro PRO team from 0 to 60 people.” Over the project, McKinsey helped CP AXTRA to embed upskilling and professional development into the fabric of the organization’s culture, building capabilities of more than 200 colleagues who are dedicated to Makro PRO, and updating compensation and benefits for the company. As Dymfke Kuijpers, a McKinsey senior partner who leads our retail work globally and our consumer work in Asia explains: “As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth themselves. In the end, tech is never the bottleneck—a lack of people and capabilities are.” Uncovering pain points Building a minimum viable product from scratch “We were true partners across each and every part of the business build, working as one team,” says Tomas Laboutka, a McKinsey expert associate partner. “This kind of collaboration made it easy to share ideas, test and iterate quickly, and ultimately create a trust-based relationship that was critical as we worked remotely most of the time.” The impact Unlocking opportunities for employees, small farmers, and businesses alike Over the last two years, CP AXTRA has reskilled more than 200 employees to support its omni-channel business and Makro PRO platform, which now processes thousands of orders daily with tens of thousands of products available on the platform. Elsewhere, CP AXTRA expands the opportunity for sellers like small farmers to reach customers. “This impact is a result of a shared vision and excitement that we have with CP AXTRA for building a new business that can benefit many local businesses–the heartbeat of the Thai economy,” Tomas says. As Noppamas Sivakriskul, a McKinsey senior partner and the managing partner of our Thailand office, says: “This is a brand I’ve grown up with and loved. I’ve had the chance to partner with its leadership team for nearly a decade. This is an idea that we’ve been exploring for a few years.

While 40 to 45 percent of those chats usually get resolved by the current classic chatbot, that still leaves another 16,500 customers a week needing to speak with a live agent for help. This can leave customers with potentially longer waiting times as they’re only able to get live help for non-urgent requests during working hours. Generative AI’s ability to interact with human language in ways simply not possible before created an opportunity for teams from QuantumBlack, McKinsey's AI arm, and ING to explore how advanced chatbot technology could be used to improve the customer experience, giving customers the assistance they need immediately. This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry. From idea to impact The Solution Developing advanced chatbot capabilities A joint ING and McKinsey team worked closely together for seven weeks to build a generative AI chatbot that offered customers immediate tailored help while maintaining clear guardrails to mitigate risk. The team started with an in-depth analysis of the existing chatbot to identify specific challenges. The final solution consisted of a multi-step pipeline to generate the best answer for the customer including knowledge retrieval from available data stores and a ranking of potential answers by helpfulness. In the case when several helpful answers arose, the system would offer multiple options to the customer – a process called disambiguation. Lastly, before any answer was sent to the customer, a series of guardrails was applied. In order to do this, ING risk stakeholders were brought into this process from the very start and ING-specific guardrails (to avoid giving advice on mortgages and investment products, for example) were built using out-of-the-box tools from QuantumBlack Labs , our AI and machine learning innovation hub. The gen AI chatbot was released on testing days to 10 percent of real customers in the Netherlands who were using the support chat function on the mobile app. It offered a customer experience that was demonstrably superior to the classic chatbot, providing customers with much more detailed and tailored responses, and helping them resolve their queries faster. Since launching in September 2023, thousands of customers have interacted with the new gen AI chatbot, making it the first-of-its-kind real-life customer-facing pilot conducted in Europe. “By prioritizing real customer needs, security, and ease of use, ING was able to develop a bespoke customer support tool that gives users the best possible experience,” says ING chief operating officer Marnix van Stiphout. The Impact At the forefront of gen AI applications in banking When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers. “When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers,” says McKinsey senior partner and co-leader of the Global Banking and Securities Practice Stephanie Hauser . As part of a broader effort, ING focused on capability building across more than 50 support functions – in the Risk department, Contact Center department, and Analytics Office and Technology – giving ING a lighthouse case to more broadly scale their gen AI efforts. Working together, the ING and McKinsey team created a path to double performance of the chatbot in the next six months, build a scalable model that can be extended to all other ING countries, and setup a technical foundation for ING to address a wide set of gen AI use-cases across the Group. The efforts helped define a blueprint to scale across ten markets with the potential to impact more than 37 million customers across 40 countries. “This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry,” says Bahadir Yilmaz, ING Chief Analytics Officer. “Gen AI technology will further evolve and we feel well-positioned to leverage those developments in order to offer the customer the best experience and remain a technology leader in our industry.” Lessons Learned Let’s connect Andrea Del Miglio Senior PartnerMilan Carlo Giovine PartnerLondon Stephanie Hauser Senior PartnerLondon Mohcine Ouass PartnerAmsterdam Niels Van der Wildt PartnerLondon Related Generative AI QuantumBlack Labs", "summary": "ING has developed an advanced generative AI chatbot in collaboration with McKinsey, enhancing customer support by providing immediate, tailored assistance.

It oversees a vast network of passenger airlines and aviation service companies. 2023 ESG Report: Accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth for all Up until 2022, Lufthansa housed its data across 14 separate ERP applications. This meant that their spend management solution was able to provide an overview at a high level. The company recognized that if they could gain more transparency across these data sources, they would be able to identify actionable spend insights at more granular levels across the organization. Lufthansa wanted to track more accurately what they were sourcing and paying for; this would open a channel to strengthen their procurement strategies, help identify more savings, and better understand their carbon footprint. “Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems,” says Holger Koenig, enterprise architect for Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “We wanted to break down data silos, simplify the delivery of trusted data faster across all our systems, and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources.” In 2022, leaders began working with McKinsey on a SaaS solution. It would need to play well with their own implementation of SAP’s Business Technology Platform (BTP) and translate siloed data streams into a consolidated, global view of procurement spend. It was called Spendscape. The Solution A fully integrated SaaS software Spendscape provides a comprehensive understanding of procurement spending. McKinsey adapted it to integrate with SAP’s BTP to enable data and analytics-driven management and create holistic visibility across the supply chain. Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems. We wanted to break down data silos... and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources. “Sophisticated organizations require superior data and insights for decision making. Procurement has gotten significantly more complex with carbon emission targets, managing supply risk, and inflation and deflation factors coming into play,” says McKinsey partner Björn-Uwe Mercker . “We now have a lot of volatility in the market, which drives the need for a super-fast reaction time. To do this, you need a data model and analytics that can keep up.” Fully integrating the Spendscape SaaS software onto SAP’s platform would create a 360-degree view of Lufthansa’s procurement performance. First implemented at Lufthansa Technik, a business focused on maintenance and repair of aircraft, and now being rolled out across the group, the tool is creating greater spend transparency across sourcing systems, simplifying data integration processes, and informing supplier negotiations to help reduce costs. For example, future purchasing decisions could be made using not just a full picture of external costs and spending across the value chain but also with the added layers of near-real-time data on price volatility and carbon emissions -- leading to smarter decision making and procurement across the board. Once fully realized across the group, the successful implementation of this tool could have far-reaching implications. It will provide better metrics across operations, including risk analytics, supplier negotiation, working capital, monitoring of material cost and procurement performance, among other areas. “With Spendscape, we aspire to build one comprehensive spend analytics platform for Lufthansa, fully embedding it into our IT architecture strategy,” says Lennart May, senior director procurement, Lufthansa Group. “This will deliver actionable insights and be integrated with future systems.” This reduces the number of tech components they need to use on the backend and allows for a solution that’s fast and scalable for future systems. The Impact Optimizing cost and carbon reduction decisions Spendscape has already uncovered actionable spend insights for Lufthansa Technik, where it was first deployed. It has also made it easier to collaborate across business units and provided a tool for data model changes and near-real time cash position management. The impact goes beyond financial and operational improvements. With the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive taking effect at the start of 2024, Lufthansa also needs to strengthen and prioritize capabilities and transparency around upstream Scope 3 emissions reporting. Spendscape unites procurement data from more than ten ERP systems into a single taxonomy. The result is a searchable source of truth combining information on carbon footprint across categories, down to the consumption and invoice level. This made it possible for Lufthansa to create comprehensive Scope 3 emissions transparency and collaborate more effectively with suppliers to improve reporting accuracy and optimize decisions for both carbon reduction and cost savings. “This is one of the more sophisticated use cases that goes well beyond classic spend reporting ,” says Björn. “Spendscape’s ability to create more transparency around Scope 3 emissions shows just how powerful a sophisticated data landscape can be in transforming the way businesses are run.” Related case studies McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation Building a next-generation carbon platform to accelerate the path to net zero Let’s connect Björn-Uwe Mercker PartnerMunich", "summary": "Lufthansa is using a SaaS solution, Spendscape, to consolidate its procurement data across multiple ERP systems.

A growing number of companies with long-term carbon reduction strategies are turning to carbon credits to hold themselves accountable for their more immediate carbon footprint. As a result, demand is expected to increase 15-fold by 2030 and 100-fold by 2050, according to the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets , a private-sector-led initiative informed by McKinsey knowledge and advisory support. Within the next decade, the overall market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth upwards of $50 billion. And yet, the process for identifying, vetting, buying, and managing carbon credits around the world has proven labor-intensive and hard to scale for many companies. It often requires them to conduct their own due diligence for each project they consider funding. This nascent market includes an evolving and often subjective definition of quality, varying degrees of carbon removal permanence, lack of price transparency, and uncalculated risk. Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants. In the face of such growing demand and complexity, the private equity firm and global alternative asset manager TPG saw the need for a more sophisticated approach to accessing carbon markets. Leadership at TPG Rise Climate, TPG’s dedicated climate-focused private equity fund, saw an opportunity to leverage the tools of more mature markets—diversification, active management, and risk management—to address barriers to scaling efficient voluntary carbon markets. They partnered with McKinsey to build a new platform that would fill critical gaps in the market. What’s behind a Rubicon Carbon Tonne? Rubicon Carbon creates diversified portfolios of high-quality carbon credits called Rubicon Carbon Tonnes or RCTs. These portfolios are offered as curated baskets of credits or can be customized to fit a company's net-zero plan. The RCT is designed to reduce risks and increase options for climate-ambitious corporate buyers. Rubicon Carbon offers three curated RCT portfolios: nature-based emissions avoidance and reductions, industrial emissions reductions, and carbon removal. The RCT uses the tools, logic, and lessons of finance to enable companies to invest safely in carbon credits. “Rubicon Carbon constructs and oversees collections of high-quality carbon credits that have gone through a professional vetting process and are monitored on an ongoing basis,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane. “Their model essentially provides carbon credits as a service, allowing their customers to seamlessly access market-leading capabilities and tools.” “Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane . “TPG and McKinsey asked: How can we partner to build the next generation carbon platform and do it fast enough to create a market leader in a rapidly evolving space?” McKinsey worked with TPG to create Rubicon Carbon , an easy-to-use, transparent, enterprise-grade digital platform that offers innovative, high-quality corporate carbon products at scale in order to accelerate global sustainability and carbon removal. From idea to impact The Solution An innovative risk-adjusted carbon credit portfolio Over the course of less than 12 months, we worked alongside TPG to build and launch the Rubicon Carbon platform, applying a real capital markets approach to innovation in carbon markets. This included market research and segmentation, developing the business and product concept, using Leap business building strategies , business planning and execution, and helping secure sponsor launch funding. The work centered on establishing Rubicon Carbon as an enterprise-grade partner that brings sophisticated capabilities to corporate customers so that they don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every carbon credit transaction. Priorities to get there included coming up with a science-based approach to identifying high-quality credits, vetting the numerous attributes that drive quality and value to customers, and navigating the shifting landscape of risks in the market by actively managing baskets of credits over their life cycle. “Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time,” says Rubicon Carbon chief science officer Dr. Jennifer Jenkins. “By including a diversified portfolio of carbon projects, applying rigorous quality guardrails, and conducting ongoing monitoring and risk adjustments, we’re able to lower the risk assumed by buyers.” Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here. Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors. Over the course of six months, our team helped co-create a tech infrastructure and platform that integrated transaction management, carbon credit custody, customer portfolio management, and full enterprise technology architecture. The work included corporate onboarding and accounted for the necessary compliance features along with bespoke carbon credit purchasing and inventory management. “Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here,” says McKinsey associate partner Charles Riesenberg. “Previously, buyers in the market had to find and diligence individual carbon credit projects in different parts of the world, which creates an incredibly complex market.  Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors.” The Impact Connecting companies to meaningful climate projects TPG and Rubicon Carbon accelerated the platform’s time to market and customer acquisition over the course of six months. In addition to overseeing the asset management platform build, McKinsey helped refine the product and offering strategy, designed initial product portfolios, and helped design the new company’s org structure. What began as 25 full-time employees, two MVP products, and a coalition of 15 corporate launch partners (including McKinsey), has now grown to become a market leader in next-generation carbon solutions including four distinct product offerings and a $1 billion capital mobilization goal. Rubicon Carbon has created a reliable way for companies with long-term carbon reduction goals to make a more immediate impact in offsetting their emissions. Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time. It's already making a difference around the world. For example, through one project alone, 150,000 hectares have been preserved in Borneo. Elsewhere, methane emissions are being cut in Bangladesh, and 5,000 acres in Africa are being reforested to expand the habitat for endangered gorillas. \"It’s clear that companies must reduce emissions within their value chain, but to balance remaining emissions that can't be eliminated right now, we also need to scale high-quality carbon credits,” says Rubicon Carbon CEO Thomas Montag. \"Rubicon Carbon helps direct corporate funds toward meaningful climate projects in need of capital and moves us closer to reaching the ambitious net zero goals our planet needs.\" Let’s Connect Sean Kane Charles Riesenberg Related case studies From farm to tablet: Building a new business to solve an old challenge Made in Africa: Catalyzing stronger, sustainable, and inclusive economies How a global components manufacturer built an ambitious carbon reduction roadmap", "summary": "Rubicon Carbon, developed by TPG and McKinsey, is a next-generation carbon platform that simplifies access to high-quality carbon credits for companies aiming for net-zero emissions.

While retail spaces must comply with ADA codes, once elements like moveable furniture and merchandise are added, accessibility can become limited. Starbucks is hoping to set an elevated standard of accessibility by going beyond ADA requirements to create spaces that make everyone feel welcome. With 16,000 stores in the U.S., the coffee giant knew it had a big opportunity to catalyze change for this large and diverse population. Starbucks wanted to make accessible design the rule rather than the exception for its customers and employees. “Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody,” says Katie Young, Starbucks SVP of Store Operations. “We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores.” Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores. In 2021, Starbucks began working with McKinsey to develop elements of inclusive store design to reduce friction for those with disabilities and support independence for all in any built retail environment. The work included understanding potential points of exclusion and creating guidelines – what Starbucks now calls the Inclusive Spaces Framework – to make spaces more accessible for persons with disabilities. “The entirety of this work was not just about building something that’s just specific to Starbucks,” says McKinsey partner Anne Kronschnabl. “They wanted to develop guidelines to help change the retail industry at large. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it.” The Solution Minimizing points of exclusion McKinsey worked with Starbucks to identify barriers that may exist for people with disabilities throughout the customer journey. Heatmaps showed pain points around entering the store, ordering, and navigating spaces like the drive-thru and restrooms. Then the team worked on ideating potential solutions to eliminate or minimize points of exclusion throughout those spaces. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it. One critical element of the approach was that persons with lived experiences were an integral part of the team, participating in every step of the work. “We were very intentional about who we had on our working team and made sure we had people representing different disability types involved in ideation and prioritization,” says Anne. “We made sure to have lots of involvement from individuals with lived experiences.” This led to a set of proposed changes such as wider spaces to allow easier access for wheelchair users, better signage in critical locations and at varying heights, and a variety of sound and lighting zones to accommodate varying sensory needs. Starbucks also wanted to focus on the employee experience. We looked at the employee journey and redesigned employee spaces with accessibility as a priority. More inclusive equipment was introduced, including a new drip brewer designed with a larger dial and visual and haptic feedback. The Impact A new set of accessibility guidelines In February of 2024, Starbucks opened its first retail space designed using this inclusive spaces framework in Washington, DC. It now plans to scale the design efforts across more stores. It’s a significant commitment. This year Starbucks plans to grow its U.S. footprint by around 4 percent, with plans to open around 600 new stores in addition to the existing 16,000 stores across the U.S. Growth plans will include the use of these new accessibility guidelines so that all newly built and renovated Starbucks company-operated stores in the U.S. will incorporate these more inclusive design elements. The retailer is also thinking beyond its own walls. Starbucks plans to share this inclusive design framework with other retailers and is standing up an Inclusive Spaces Coalition. The hope is that more retailers across the U.S. and beyond will use these learnings to make their built environments as inclusive as possible for customers and employees. “This framework defines how Starbucks will help expand independence, choice, and ease for all people across physical and digital spaces,\" says Starbucks CEO, and McKinsey alum, Laxman Narasimhan in a LinkedIn post . \"Developed alongside a diverse community of customers, partners, and accessibility experts, the framework will be open-source to help expand accessibility across the entire retail industry.\" Our People Anne Kronschnabl Becca Coggins Related case studies 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Protecting workers through award-winning design", "summary": "Starbucks aims to enhance accessibility in its stores by exceeding ADA requirements, collaborating with McKinsey to create the Inclusive Spaces Framework.

McKinsey is providing pro bono support to the effort through data and analytics tools that enable recruiters to recognize STARs and their skills. “While companies scramble to find talent amid a perceived skills gap, many of their job postings have needlessly excluded half of the workers in the country who have the skills for higher-wage work,” says Byron Auguste , founder of Opportunity@Work and a former senior partner at McKinsey. “Companies like the ones we're proud to call partners in this effort—and those we hope will join—can lead the way by tapping into skilled talent from a far wider range of backgrounds.” McKinsey has driven extensive research on skills-based hiring and human capital , and built data-driven solutions that help employers implement new ways of screening for knowledge, skills, and capacity to learn. “A few years ago, we looked at many talent solutions in the market. There was a real risk of hard-wiring outdated notions of being a skilled worker,” says McKinsey partner Carolyn Pierce , who leads the technology team in the People and Organizational Performance practice . “Those systems gave little credit even to our own team members for skills learned on the job.” People & Organizational Performance: Equipping people and organizations to unleash sustained performance Carolyn and her team began collaborating with Opportunity@Work to prove the value and transferability of skills developed through work experience. “The Opportunity@Work team has done some incredible research that makes the business case for hiring STARs into today’s most in-demand jobs” says Carolyn. Our pro bono support will help make those insights more widely available to employers. “We increasingly hear from employers that they want to recruit from the STARs talent pool,” says Shad Ahmed, COO of Opportunity@Work. “But they need practical, data-driven tools to replace degree screens and hire STARs. The portal we are building with support from McKinsey will help employers identify which jobs should be open to STARs and help them source from this valuable talent pool. It’s a key part of our mission to create vital technology infrastructure wired for inclusion.” McKinsey is committed to tearing the ‘paper ceiling’ in our own hiring practices. “We have made significant investments to ensure that our own talent culture is both distinctive and inclusive, attracting and developing talent from a wide range of backgrounds,” says Katy George , senior partner and CHRO of McKinsey. “We are investing in more ways to recruit, hire, and grow STARs through a holistic approach that recognizes candidates’ skills and experience, problem-solving ability and intrinsic capabilities.” McKinsey’s technology organization is at the forefront of this effort, with many entry-level roles already open to STARs who have the necessary knowledge and skills. “We already have technologists at the firm—from entry-level through partner—who are STARs,” says Katy. “Our technology teams work on important and challenging problems, from helping organizations reduce their carbon footprint to improving worker safety. Our best path to solving these problems is to attract talented people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Our recruiting teams are actively working to make more STARs aware of these opportunities and encourage them to apply.” Creating more opportunities for STARs requires more than simply removing degree requirements from job descriptions. “We are scaling support for apprenticeships, bootcamps, and training programs to accelerate pathways for STARs into our firm” adds Katy. “The programs will help STAR talent build any additional skills needed for success at McKinsey and beyond.” There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential. We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up. Byron is hopeful that having McKinsey as a sponsor of this campaign will encourage more employers to change their talent practices. “A lot of organizations know that McKinsey is very data driven. It’s a strong signal that they are helping to build better ways to screen for talent and creating opportunities for STARs through their own hiring,” he says. Challenging the misconceptions associated with not having a college degree is key to helping more people tear through the paper ceiling. “Screening for a degree is one way to find people with skills and the capacity to learn—the problem is that you’re also screening for who had the right social and economic conditions in place to attend college,” says Carolyn. “There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential,” Carolyn adds. “We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up.” related No such thing as a dead-end job, new McKinsey research finds Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey is supporting the \"Tear the Paper Ceiling\" campaign to improve job opportunities for STARs (workers skilled through alternative routes) in the US.

Scaling supply chains and infrastructure, developing analytics tools to assess climate risk, reskilling workers in highly carbon-dependent markets, and more will have a massive impact on our ability to stabilize global temperatures in line with the 1.5C-degree pathway. To help our clients reach their sustainability and broader ESG goals, we have launched Sustainability Academy , a capability-building program that helps organizations better equip their talent for the net zero transition. “Making our economic system more sustainable and more inclusive is an imperative that is felt by all types of stakeholders, from governments and regulators, to clients, suppliers, and end consumers,” says partner Pietro Sorrentino , who helps lead Sustainability Academy. “Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that: help companies accelerate change by supporting them in building new knowledge for their employees.” The program was designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy —our capability building center of excellence—and follows a simple approach: acquire, apply, and sustain. First, Sustainability Academy offers formal learning experiences to help talent acquire new knowledge and skills through practice and feedback. Second, teams apply these mindsets and capabilities in a real-world context, where impact materializes. Finally, we help organizations sustain new practices and habits to unlock lasting behavioral change. Sustainability Academy has launched with two foundational programs. Our Executive Masterclass kickstarts transformations by aligning senior executives with the mindsets and skills required to deliver their sustainability agendas. Sustainability Transformation Essentials, meanwhile, helps clients develop enterprise-wide awareness of core sustainability concepts, including the climate transition, solving the net-zero equation, and capturing new business opportunities. The program is already driving impact with clients. Recently, we partnered with a Fortune 500 company to accelerate their net-zero journey, helping them become an industry ESG leader. In this case, the client had articulated clear sustainability targets—including reaching net zero for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. But leaders needed to equip their teams with the practical skill sets needed to engage both internally and externally with stakeholders and suppliers. This is a common challenge: industry benchmarks show that in some sectors, nearly 100 percent of companies have defined and communicated sustainability strategies, but only 40 percent believe they have sufficient internal knowledge and capabilities to achieve their targets. Given that about 90 percent of our client’s emissions fell into Scope 3 (within the supply chain and not directly owned by the organization), equipping their talent with capabilities to engage their suppliers was particularly important. Sustainability Academy The company asked McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy to help their talent build the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they needed to engage with their suppliers to reduce emissions across the value chain. Together, we co-developed a multimodal journey—integrating fieldwork, digital learning, and live workshops—to help the client’s category managers prepare for conversations with suppliers. This journey looked at key emissions categories, such as distribution and logistics, identifying the sustainability opportunities to discuss with suppliers and internal stakeholders. It also provided modules on how to best lead the supplier discussions and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The same client also sought to increase spend with diverse companies by more than $1 billion across their tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We partnered with the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion team to create robust diversity programs and track against diversity targets. These efforts culminated in a virtual supplier summit with more than 200 suppliers and more than 1,000 internal and external attendees. Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that... These efforts delivered significant impact on both the sustainability and inclusion fronts. Supplier commitments to science-based targets increased by more than 50 percent from the baseline, and gains were made on supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion, with additional commitments on tier 2 reporting and identification of new business opportunities with tier 1 diverse suppliers. “Completing the online training modules, supported by the virtual forum sessions and open office hours, helped our client’s people build a fact-base for working with their suppliers, which enabled them to have productive conversations at the supplier summit,” says partner Maria Fernandez . “Today, this work is the foundation upon which their multi-year ESG transformation resides.” If your organization is interested in working with Sustainability Academy, please email us . related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey's Sustainability Academy aims to upskill workers for the net-zero transition by providing capability-building programs.

With the evisceration of manufacturing jobs, it needed a major transformation. In 2011, the state had a novel idea. Using profits from the beverage industry, Ohio formed a new entity—a first-of-its-kind, state-authorized non-profit—to stimulate economic growth through new industries: JobsOhio . Over the next decade, the state saw nearly one million jobs created or protected. McKinsey was a key early partner, helping develop JobsOhio’s growth plan that identified ten sectors with opportunities for employment, such as aerospace and aviation, healthcare, logistics and distribution, technology, and financial services. In 2010, Ohio ranked 49th for job growth rate in these ten sectors. By 2022, they ranked 20th in job growth rate and had added $13 billion in payroll. The state’s job creation was its best ever, but JobsOhio wanted to ensure its strategy would be effective going forward. In 2018, the initiative asked McKinsey to issue a report evaluating its performance. “JobsOhio was in a class by itself in terms of economic development organizations as far as dollars per job, attracting companies, capital investments, and more,” says Ben Safran , a partner at McKinsey who worked on the report. “But we also found it needed to address approaching headwinds in the broader macro economy.” Brendan Buescher , a McKinsey senior partner based in Cleveland, says the findings encouraged JobsOhio to think locally. “They were certainly performing well against comparable organizations,” says Brendan, “but we urged them to measure success against the needs of Ohioans.” The case for inclusive growth The report helped shape JobsOhio’s 2.0 strategy, which expanded its industry-focus to include a new emphasis on workforce, innovation, infrastructure and investment throughout the state. From this, JobsOhio developed Innovation Districts in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—, multi-organization partnerships plan to create 60,000 jobs and establishing Ohio as a global leader in healthcare, life sciences, and technology in these three regions. As the new strategy was getting off the ground, COVID-19 rocked the state’s economy. Partnering with McKinsey again, JobsOhio quickly created a strategy for the pandemic economy, leading to the launch of Ohio to Work . Designed for displaced workers, Ohio to Work offered skills assessments, career coaching, virtual career fairs, and connection with employers who had signed on to interview or hire workers from the program. Specifically, McKinsey helped JobsOhio develop a unique program for reskilling and upskilling for higher-tech jobs: JobsOhio paid for tuition costs for technical degrees, and enrollees gradually repaid JobsOhio through a marginal percentage of their income—if they got a job that paid a good wage. Those repaid funds are not kept by JobsOhio; instead, the organization invests them in the next cohort. The program has been a success. Its funds have continued to replenish because of the high employment rate of participants. “With this strategy, not only is Ohio coming back strong from COVID-19, but Ohioans have the opportunity to pursue new careers they might have never thought possible,” says Ben. “A woman who had been a back-office worker and lost her job is now a nurse assistant—a whole new, stable career that feels like a calling. There are many powerful stories like this.” As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years. Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Most recently, the decade of growth and economic investment in Ohio helped attract a new investment from Intel, which announced earlier this year that it would be opening a new chip manufacturing plant in Central Ohio . This huge project is the largest single private-sector company investment in the state. It will create 3,000 new jobs at the plant with an average salary of $135,000. “As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years,” says JP Nauseef , president & CEO of JobsOhio. “Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The turnaround of the state’s jobs growth, Ben adds, suggests a potential way forward for other challenging situations. “Their success has been a paradigm shift,” says Ben Safran. “They are a model for growth in a changing economy.” related Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story", "summary": "JobsOhio, established in 2011, transformed Ohio's struggling economy post-Great Recession by creating nearly one million jobs and enhancing job growth from 49th to 20th in ten sectors.

They had come to learn what would happen when they cranked the big mill up to a work rate that had never been tried. The possibility of causing problems at the mill weighed on everyone’s mind. The team members had initially resisted the idea of running the mill faster. They wanted to keep the stockpile of ore that feeds the mill from dropping below the minimum size they had long maintained. Their concern was that a too-small stockpile would hamper the mill’s performance. Whether the minimum stockpile size actually helped the mill run better was another matter. No one really knew for sure. Nor could the mill’s managers and staff say what would happen if the stockpile shrank to less than the traditional minimum. As the weeks went by, the copper-ore concentrating mill sustained a faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. What they did know is that a custom-built artificial-intelligence (AI) model, loaded with three years’ worth of operating data from the mill and programmed to look for operational tweaks that would boost output, kept saying copper production would rise if the mill were fed with more ore per minute. To the mill operators, that notion sounded logical enough—except that it didn’t account for the minimum stockpile size they had in mind. But the model didn’t know, or care, about minimum stockpile size or any of the mill operators’ other ideas about how the mill ought to be run. With permission from company executives, the crew members at the Bagdad site decided to turn up the pace of the mill as the model had suggested. They also prepared to ramp up mining and crushing activities so the stockpile of ore wouldn’t run out. At ten o’clock in the morning, a technician clicked a control on his computer screen to speed up the system of conveyor belts carrying chunks of ore from the crusher to the stockpile and from the stockpile to the mill. Everyone in the room kept watch on the 13 oversize monitors in the control room, which were lit up with readings from hundreds of performance sensors placed around the mill. The quantity of ore grinding through the mill rose. No warnings went up. Twelve hours passed. The mill held steady. Even when its stockpile of ore dipped below the usual minimum, the accelerated delivery of ore from the crusher and the mine allowed the mill to keep going. As the weeks went by, the mill sustained the faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. “That was the breakthrough we’d been looking for,” Justin Cross, the Bagdad site’s general manager, told us. “Once we started to run the mill at full speed, we knew we could get results from more of the recommendations that the model was making.” The ‘age of the operator’ The story of how Freeport-McMoRan learned to rely on an AI model as much as the intuition of veteran mining engineers and metallurgists might not raise eyebrows outside the tech industry. For mining companies, though, it illustrates a quiet but profound shift into an era we think of as the “age of the operator,” when the best-run businesses wring profits out of low-grade ore that miners would have waved off as waste just ten years ago. One mine where Freeport-McMoRan had been processing declining ore grades is Bagdad, a sprawling Arizona complex where prospectors staked their first claims in 1882. Bagdad’s reserves of higher-grade ore have been depleted for some time, but Freeport-McMoRan has sustained the mine’s production of copper by making various process improvements. By the end of 2017, executives believed that Bagdad had gotten as efficient as it could get with its existing equipment, so they reasoned that adding capacity would be the surest way to get even more copper out of the site. Early in 2018, they started planning a $200 million capital expansion of Bagdad’s ore-concentrating mill that would lift production by 20 percent. Copper prices were high at the time. The investment looked certain to pay off. Then copper prices dropped from a five-year peak of around $3.30 per pound in early June to $2.75 or so a month later. All of a sudden, investing $200 million to expand Bagdad no longer seemed practical. Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase the site’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Instead, Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase Bagdad’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Discovering improvements at an efficient mine wouldn’t be easy. But Freeport-McMoRan had plenty of high-quality information to study. Around ten years before, Bert Odinet, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief information officer, coordinated an effort to standardize the way that each site measures and reports its performance and to build a central data warehouse for storing those measurements. Several years later, maintenance teams lobbied for the installation of additional network equipment and performance sensors on the company’s trucks, power shovels, and stationary machines. The teams would manually download data from those sensors to the data warehouse so they could further sharpen their maintenance practices and improve the functioning of equipment. When wireless mesh networks became cost effective and reliable, Freeport-McMoRan installed them at all its sites. Now the company could capture and correlate second-by-second performance readings in the data warehouse, all in real time. “We learned things we’d have never predicted,” Odinet said. “That project taught us to be more receptive to what the data was telling us. And it gave us the confidence to try more complicated analyses.” With advanced analytics and AI techniques , Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of data it collected, identify even more operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in the field. Bagdad looked like a good proving ground for this method. The site is staffed with creative, open-minded engineers, metallurgists, and equipment operators who stood out at Freeport-McMoRan for their willingness to try new things. Their earlier efforts to enhance Bagdad’s metallurgical processes, for example, had resulted in higher copper recovery. And Cross, Bagdad’s general manager, was a natural tinkerer who liked to spend his free time outfitting his pickup truck for off-road use and milling mesquite logs into lumber for a house he planned to build himself. Since joining Freeport-McMoRan in 2006, Cross had led a series of projects to streamline operations at the company’s mines. Would you like to learn more about McKinsey Analytics ? It also helped that Bagdad’s operations were stable. With few equipment problems or process hiccups to straighten out, workers would have time to help increase copper production. Executives felt that promising opportunities to boost Bagdad’s production could be found in one part of the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, a noisy facility where huge milling machines and flotation cells bubbling with chemical solutions turn grapefruit-size rocks containing around 0.4 percent copper into a fine-ground mix of 25 percent copper and 75 percent rock. The mill’s technicians ran the facility strictly by the book, a set of operating instructions that Freeport-McMoRan engineers in Phoenix had developed. There had to be ways of building on those instructions that would better the mill’s performance. After talking things over with engineers and operations specialists from Bagdad and from headquarters, Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson and CFO Kathleen Quirk decided to let the crew at Bagdad work with McKinsey on a new kind of mining project: data mining in an agile way. Learning agile The project called for more than sophisticated data science. It also called for a new approach to solving tricky operational problems. “Usually when we run operational projects, we overengineer them. We test every conceivable scenario, build in safeguards, and do everything we can to ensure that a process change will result in an improvement before we make it,” Cross observed. “It’s a dependable way to get good results. But it takes a huge amount of time, effort, and capital investment.” McKinsey’s consultants reckoned that the crew at Bagdad might get better results, more quickly, by carrying out the analytics project differently. They introduced the idea of working under agile principles , which emphasize quick development of functional solutions that teams then improve, little by little, according to feedback from users. The general manager assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. Another essential feature of agile methods is face-to-face collaboration within well-rounded teams . Cross assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. The composition of the team allowed it to tap the expertise and account for the interests of each division of Bagdad that its work might affect. It also enabled the team to contend better with challenges that involved different divisions and couldn’t be solved by one division alone. The team’s agile approach was to work in “sprints”—two-week bouts of activity in which the team conceived a data-modeling function or operational change, tested it, and learned what would make it better. As improvements came to light, the team would add them to a backlog. Then it would plow through the items on the backlog in subsequent sprints, starting with the easiest, most beneficial tasks. For Bagdad’s crew members, this agile style of working wasn’t just different from business as usual. It represented a radical departure from the way they’d been doing things. “It took us a while to get comfortable with agile,” Cross said. “We had to let go of a lot of old habits.” McKinsey brought in agile coaches to help. The coaches explained the rudiments of agile —building a backlog, deciding what to accomplish in each sprint, holding morning meetings to agree on the work the crew would perform each day and to note any difficulties that might slow it down—but were mainly there\nto join the team’s activities and teach its members to work together in agile ways. Shannon Lijek, a McKinsey partner who specializes in helping organizations apply agile methods, was one of the coaches who came to help the Bagdad team get the hang of agile. “We’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” said McKinsey partner Shannon Lijek. “Agile can be tricky to adopt at first because it isn’t a process you can memorize. It’s a set of principles for minimizing wasted effort and getting more work done. And we’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” Lijek said. One way that Bagdad’s agile team cut out needless effort was by introducing solutions as soon as it had built “minimum viable products,” or MVPs, that were good enough to use, rather than laboring to perfect those products first. “If we’d built the model ourselves, we’d have tried to get it 100 percent right before doing anything with it,” Cross told us. “Shannon and the McKinsey coaches encouraged us to work with solutions that weren’t finished. They’d say, ‘You can get 60 percent of the improvement with an MVP, and that’s a lot. So just start using it. Then you can worry about making it better.’” Introducing AI and agile to mining operations: Lessons from Bagdad By Red Conger Freeport-McMoRan’s effort to increase copper production at Bagdad taught us a good deal about how to use agile methods and AI tools at our sites, where it can be difficult to alter accepted routines. Here are a few things we’re keeping in mind as we expand the use of agile and AI to more of Freeport-McMoRan’s operations: Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan. From predicting to optimizing Once the team Cross formed came together, it began investigating the possibility of improving the mill’s performance. The idea was to spend a month examining data from the mill for patterns that revealed potential improvements. If those improvements looked promising enough, the team would pursue them. Beginning in late June, the Bagdad team and data scientists from McKinsey built a machine-learning model to check whether the mill truly ran as efficiently as people believed. The model, a type of extreme gradient-boosting model, consisted of an ensemble of thousands of decision trees that had been engineered to include a great deal of metallurgical knowledge. The staff at Bagdad and Freeport-McMoRan’s central operations group believed all the ore entering the mill was of the same type. Consequently, they had defined a single “recipe” of lower and upper parameters for the mill’s 42 control settings: the mix of differently sized ore chunks being fed into the mill, the pH level in the flotation cells, and so on. But when the agile team at Bagdad ran the data from the mill’s performance sensors through its model, the members of the team learned something new. From the mill’s perspective, the mine was actually producing seven distinct types of ore. What’s more, the mill’s standard recipe for control settings didn’t match the properties of all those ore types. Ore containing more iron pyrite, for example, would yield more copper if the pH level in the flotation cells were set higher than the recipe prescribed. “Thinking about ore clusters in terms of data from the mill’s instruments, rather than classifications from traditional geology, was a major mind-set shift—and it opened up many new possibilities for improving performance,” said Sean Buckley, a McKinsey partner who led the analytics work. All told, the team’s analysis suggested that adjusting the mill’s controls to suit each of the seven ore types could increase copper production by 10 percent or more. That prospect convinced Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders to let the agile team at Bagdad build an AI model that would look at the ore coming into the mill and suggest control settings to heighten production of copper from that ore. Change that Matters Team members wrote algorithms to discern the connections among the ore type, the operational readings from the plant’s sensors, the amount of ore running through the mill, and the amount of copper recovered. Next, they developed more algorithms to predict the plant’s performance based on measurements from the sensors. After several weeks of development sprints, the team members had raised the accuracy of the model’s performance predictions to 96 percent—high enough to know that the model was properly interpreting the data streaming in from the mill’s sensors and relating it to the mill’s control settings. To determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, staff decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. The team then turned its attention from predicting performance to improving it. Staff began by asking a simple question that no one had asked in some time: What measure of performance do we want to optimize? For years, the team at Bagdad had oriented its decisions and activities toward particular targets for copper production and operating cost. That approach made a certain kind of sense. It meant that Bagdad consistently generated profits. Now, to determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, the team decided to establish a new mandate— maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. Cross and Cory Stevens, Freeport-McMoRan’s vice president of operational improvement, knew that maximizing production could lessen Bagdad’s performance in other areas. The mill’s recovery rate—the percentage of copper extracted from the ore—might drop. Or the whole operation could come to a halt for hours. Stevens went to other executives to explain that Bagdad’s experiment could be costly. The performance numbers they’d see for the next few months might be dismal, he warned. Nonetheless, the executives agreed with Stevens that if Bagdad could achieve the 10 percent increase in production that the model predicted, the short-term cost would be worth it. They gave him the go-ahead to try maximizing production. With that approval, Cross granted Bagdad’s staff the latitude to make operational changes that deviated from standard procedures and could cause the mill to miss its performance targets. Worker safety and equipment integrity were the only areas where no compromises or experiments would be allowed. Any other changes were fair game. A big breakthrough Over a series of iterations during the next month or so, the team conceived, tested, and refined algorithms that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend control settings to maximize copper output. The new algorithms, known as genetic algorithms, used the principles of natural selection to “evolve” settings that would produce the most copper, given a particular type of ore. By early September, the team had expanded the prediction model into an MVP of an optimization model, dubbed TROI, that was capable of issuing recommendations every 12 hours, once for each of the mill’s two daily shifts. When each new set of recommendations came out, the engineers, equipment operators, and metallurgists on the team would huddle and decide what do to with them. TROI was a work in progress, so its earliest recommendations weren’t entirely reliable. At every shift, metallurgists from Freeport-McMoRan and from McKinsey would study the model’s recommendations and question whether they were credible. Then the metallurgists would take note of the problem recommendations so the agile team could look into them. Some recommendations led the team members to discover flaws in TROI’s logic, which they added to their backlog and corrected in subsequent development sprints. Others indicated that the underlying performance data were faulty and prompted the team to look for fixes. “TROI helps us to improve the quality of our instrumentation and highlights sensors that need attention,” said Frank Ochoa, one of Bagdad’s process-control and instrumentation engineers. Most challenging were the model’s recommendations to depart from the operational recipe that the staff at Bagdad had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Most challenging were the recommendations to depart from the operational recipe the staff had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Gradually, as the team fine-tuned TROI, its recommendations became more plausible, and the staff at Bagdad began following them. Yet many of those recommendations resulted in slim performance gains,\nif any. Mid-October arrived. The team was nowhere close to the 10 percent production boost it thought possible. Cross and Stevens decided it was time to act on a weighty recommendation that no one was especially eager to try: speeding the flow of ore from the mine and the crusher to the mill. Cross asked the mine operators to redline their activities—and reassured them that they wouldn’t be blamed for spending more money or triggering operational breakdowns. The mine operators ramped up blasting, even though they had to use more explosives. They queued up trucks to carry rocks to the crushing plant, in violation of a long-standing directive to keep trucks from standing idle. They choke-fed the giant crusher with run-of-mine, or unprocessed, ore to find out how much it could handle. Finally, on October 19, the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate. Right away, copper production jumped 5 percent. TROI had helped the team unlock a record level of performance. Small gains add up Having achieved a major performance gain, Bagdad’s agile team turned to enhancing the model’s ability to recommend mill-control settings that would increase copper production. The agile team reviewed the data model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day and kept working through a backlog of upgrades. Within several weeks, the team had refined the model to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. TROI could already identify which type of ore was running through the mill at any moment. In the next round of sprints, the team added functions to account for other incoming operational data. Each time TROI recommended a set of control settings, the metallurgists at the plant would consider the recommendations, choose which ones to accept, and pass them to shift supervisors and operators, who would adjust the mill’s controls accordingly. Letting the metallurgists decide which recommendations to follow helped the agile team learn more quickly. Occasionally, the metallurgists applied settings that looked questionable just to find out whether they would work. And when the metallurgists rejected the recommended settings, they typed notes into the model to explain their decisions. “TROI doesn’t always give fully accurate recommendations, but it provides a new perspective on how to manage the plant and challenges our assumptions,” said Lulu Raymond, a senior metallurgist at Bagdad. All the while, sensors gauged the mill’s performance. The model’s machine-learning algorithms recorded which settings improved performance and which ones didn’t, and whether the recommendations were helping. The agile team reviewed the model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day, added items to the backlog of upgrades it planned to make, and kept working on those upgrades. By early December, the team had refined TROI to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. It wasn’t long before the metallurgists and mill operators began trying to outsmart TROI. They would monitor the type of ore passing into the mill, anticipate the control settings that the model might suggest, and apply those settings before the model made its twice-daily recommendations (later increased to every three hours). This became a kind of competition: Who can run the mill better than TROI would? Most important, the mill’s production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bagdad’s throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day—10 percent more than the previous quarter—while its copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point and its operations became more stable (exhibit). The following quarter, copper production at Bagdad went up yet again. Those gains should lift Bagdad’s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200 million capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex. We think this is just the beginning for Freeport-McMoRan. Having learned to maintain TROI during the project, the company’s metallurgists and data scientists now run the model themselves, without ongoing support from McKinsey. They study daily and weekly reports that compare the mill’s performance with TROI’s predictions, and they continue enhancing the model’s ability to make recommendations. Freeport-McMoRan executives have also sponsored the creation of a second agile team at Bagdad to test and make process improvements at the mine. This team, too, is working without help from McKinsey, using the agile methods that it learned on the mill project. At another one of Freeport-McMoRan’s Arizona copper mines, Morenci, managers have kicked off an agile and analytics effort like Bagdad’s. And the company will soon launch its most ambitious program of this kind at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in Peru with five times the capacity of Bagdad. The age of the operator is here, and Freeport-McMoRan is adapting to it with agile methods and AI tools. Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan.

But based on trends that have been reshaping other industries, competition in real estate has spread to another area: customer experience. How engaged, productive, comfortable, connected, and safe we feel in our physical environment matters, and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for significant changes in the real estate industry . Practically overnight, for example, physical distancing and the need for contactless interaction have magnified the importance of digital within real estate. Pioneers in the industry have been exploring ways to diversify sources of revenue, pursuing new digitally-enabled business models and focusing on tenant experience. The pandemic has made clear that those that haven’t yet made such investments in underlying capabilities and infrastructure will need to catch up quickly. Leap by McKinsey “The future of real estate is no longer about delivering four walls to tenants,” says RXR CEO Scott Rechler . “Instead, it’s about creating a unique, personalized customer experience that fosters meaningful interactions, collaboration, productivity. Delivering this will require a unique combination of capabilities that seamlessly integrate across the physical and digital realms.” The joint Leap-RXR team has built products and services for residents that enhance their living experiences. One innovation is a new RXR app that is anchored around a resident experience officer. Designed, created, and launched by the team, the app allows residents to manage elements of their personal lives, like moving into an apartment, and use digitally-enabled concierge services for services like housekeeping and grocery delivery. Tenants can also submit and manage maintenance requests through the platform and make rent payments seamlessly. The entire experience is powered by a robust data and analytics infrastructure that is uniquely tailored and personalized, and enables staff to manage buildings in a customer-centric way. “There’s a huge opportunity to get more use out of data that these digital products create,” says Vaibhav Gujral , a McKinsey partner. “We can uniquely personalize services and experiences to tenants based on information that is made available at the right place at the right time.” Real estate is no longer just about four walls and relying on location for value appreciation. On the commercial office side, RXR is implementing new technologies to help monitor energy efficiency and environmental conditions. As companies consider what office space will look like in the return to work after coronavirus, these capabilities have positioned RXR to move with agility. For instance, the infrastructure created by RXR with Leap’s support enabled the company to respond quickly to the coronavirus, including the launch of a new comprehensive, data-driven program initiative called RxWell. “Helping to ensure an environment that prioritizes safety and wellness is particularly important in light of the coronavirus,” Rechler adds. Leap, according to McKinsey partner Jennifer Kilian , is all about bringing start-up thinking to established organizations. “In this case, that meant working with RXR to build its digital muscle,” she says. Jennifer explains that for any business to change how it creates value for customers, a diverse set of skills is needed across design, data science, advanced analytics, and business. The Leap team helped RXR determine which new roles to create and hire for. After outlining the criteria, they sourced and filled positions like software developers, data scientists, and agile coaches to ensure that the capabilities would live on beyond the initial phases of the project. Through our partnership, the company has built proprietary digital capabilities which are especially unique in the real estate industry, which will enable the organization to move with speed and agility. Building new businesses: How incumbents use their advantages to accelerate growth “Digital solutions have democratized access to experiences and conveniences for individuals and companies,” says Clay Cowan , a McKinsey partner. As people have grown accustomed to digital experiences  like online banking, tele-health, or eCommerce for example, “they expect similar from the spaces in which they live, work, play, and shop.” “We see this work as a catalyst for the rest of the industry across geographies,” says Aditya Sanghvi , a McKinsey senior partner. “Our aspiration is for this to set a new standard and benchmark for how real estate developers, owners, and operators start to think creatively about how they can create better experiences for their customers.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Superheating can be tricky to get right. Steel reaches more than 1600 degrees Celsius during superheating, and the ideal temperature range spans only 15 degrees. If the steel comes out too hot, the equipment operators must slow the casting step. If the steel isn’t hot enough, it can “freeze” before it has been cast, which compromises its quality. The frontline operators at the secondary-metallurgy station were used to running the superheating process based on past experiences. They would consider prompts from control systems, which were loaded with standard formulas, and then decide what set points to apply so the steel temperature would end up in the target range. Most of the time, they heated two of every three batches of steel into the optimal range. That “strike rate” allowed them to complete 25 “heats” per day, but it also left room for improvement. Bringing the strike rate up to 85 percent or so would result in 28 to 30 heats per day, enough to boost throughput by roughly 8 to 12 percent, or 600 to 900 daily tons. The opportunity stood out to the plant managers, who had been given a mandate to improve the plant’s performance with advanced analytics. In early 2017, they devised a plan for building analytics models that would help frontline operators get better results from the superheating process and several other activities. Data scientists from Tata Steel and McKinsey used historical information from the plant to build and “train” a superheating-optimization model, which would examine real-time operational data and recommend process set points conducive to a higher strike rate. In addition, managers arranged for some employees to receive classroom training in data science, data engineering, and other advanced-analytics disciplines. At first, the superheating model proposed settings that consistently improved the strike rate. But as the mix of steel orders from customers began to differ from the mix of orders recorded in the model’s training data, the model started to generate faulty recommendations—which frontline operators ceased to follow. Employees who had gone through the classroom training tried to fix the model but found the problems too complex to correct using the basic skills they’d learned. Similar difficulties arose with the models being used elsewhere in the plant. Despite the setback, managers had seen how the advanced-analytics models reduced costs and raised output. Managers also realized that classroom training alone would not prepare employees to sustain those performance improvements. They concluded that the company would need to further cultivate employees’ analytics skills and transform their way of working. Their insight paid off. By building these capabilities, the plant would raise its performance to world-class levels and earn acclaim from the World Economic Forum in July 2019 as one of 44 Lighthouse sites that are leading in the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. What worked and what didn’t: Lessons from Kalinganagar’s analytics program Focus on business improvements, not technology improvements. Kalinganagar expanded its use of analytics quickly by targeting performance gains and building tech solutions to achieve them, rather than looking at available technologies and thinking of how to apply them. Develop analytics talent, instead of outsourcing it. When Kalinganagar’s first-wave analytics models needed updating, the plant didn’t have in-house specialists to fix them. Hands-on training enabled the plant to cultivate the analytics talent that it needed to scale up. Scale analytics to make it a part of everyone’s way of working. Moving beyond pilot projects produced enough value to convince holdouts to embrace working with analytics. Adoption also increased as frontline employees worked with specialists to create the tools and as managers recognized employees’ success using them. Preparing for analytics, well ahead of its time Tata Steel’s multiyear effort to develop analytics capabilities at the Kalinganagar plant can be traced to a decision that executives made in 2005, when the plant was first being designed and built. Analytics technologies were then years away from becoming readily applicable to businesses. Nevertheless, Tata Steel’s executives considered whether they should outfit the plant with instruments and sensors to monitor equipment and processes. Their decision was less clear-cut than it would have been today—remote-sensing equipment is now affordable and advanced analytics has been broadly adopted . But some executives and managers foresaw that spending money on data-collection gear would prove worthwhile, even though it wasn’t yet clear how the data would be used. Amit Kumar Chatterjee, the plant’s then-head of electrical maintenance, was among those pushing to make the early investment—and even he acknowledged that at the time, the potential applications for advanced analytics were undefined. “We didn’t have in mind how we’d use the data, except maybe for autonomous process controls. We were living in the world of physical science, where experience and equations matter most. Data science was not even on the horizon,” said Chatterjee. Even the makers of the plant’s machinery resisted adding instrumentation. “Still, we believed we should put on the sensors at that stage because we felt it would be a lot harder later on, when the uses for the data were known.” By the mid-2010s, the leaders of the Kalinganagar plant began looking closely at what they could do with the data the plant’s sensors were collecting. In 2015, T. V. Narendran, the managing director of Tata Steel, set out a $1 billion cost-optimization goal and called on the heads of the company’s plants to map a path toward that goal. One way of boosting performance, he suggested, was to do more with digital technology. Advances in hardware and data science had made it easier for companies to take big data sets, uncover patterns, and make predictions that could help them attain performance improvements. Leaders at Kalinganagar launched their own investigation into how the plant might apply data science. In 2016, they traveled to Germany and visited technology start-ups and large established companies to get a close look at what data science could do. Early the following year, the plant’s leaders resolved to start an advanced-analytics program at Kalinganagar. Beginning the analytics transformation Senior managers at Kalinganagar decided to try advanced analytics on several pilot projects. During a two-day workshop, managers and operations specialists worked with McKinsey experts to identify ten possible uses for analytics and selected three to focus on—one of which involved the superheating process in the plant’s secondary-metallurgy station. Managers wanted to create an advanced-analytics model that could assess conditions in the plant and calculate how much heat to apply during superheating so that the steel would emerge in the target temperature range. The team working on the superheating model sought to discern which variables were the most important determinants of the steel’s final temperature, and thereby learn how operators could improve the strike rate. They pulled together two years’ worth of operational data that had been generated by sensors or recorded manually in logbooks. Data scientists wrote algorithms to make connections among key factors: measures of the condition of the steel as it reached the secondary-metallurgy station, equipment settings that operators would adjust during the superheating cycle, and other settings that couldn’t be adjusted during a cycle but could be altered over time (such as the maximum rate of oxygen flow, capped by the equipment already in place). Preliminary results from several pilot projects convinced leaders at Tata Steel Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort. They laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve critical performance indicators and believed that analytics could help. After two weeks, the team had built a model capable of predicting, with 75 percent accuracy, whether a group of set-point recommendations would cause the molten steel to reach the casting station in the desired temperature range. The other two pilot-project teams built models of similar reliability. Although none of the models had yet been put to the test on the plant floor, the preliminary results convinced leaders at Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort and create models that employees would actually use. In September 2017, leaders laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve the plant’s critical performance indicators—energy consumption, throughput, quality, and yield—and believed that analytics could help . They chose to carry over the work on the superheating model to the first full phase of the project. Together, the five areas had the potential to enhance margins by $10 million annually. Ramping up As operations teams and analytics specialists built the phase-one models, leaders at Kalinganagar sponsored an effort to begin training some 130 employees—which comprised one-quarter of the managerial staff—in analytics. With McKinsey, the plant set up an introductory analytics academy , installed a 15-member faculty, and created 50-hour curricula for five roles: digital champion, project owner, business translator, data scientist, and data engineer. Students performed simple practice exercises in line with the duties dictated by their roles. Although the models from the first phase worked well for a time, they started to falter as conditions in the plant deviated from the conditions that the models had been optimized for. The employees who had been through the academy tried to fix the models but could not do so using the basic techniques they’d learned by that point. And they had yet to work as apprentices on analytics projects, which would have given them hands-on experience retraining models. They simply needed more real-world exposure to analytics. Challenges also arose as frontline operators tried to start working with the models. Shailendra Rai, the chief of blast-furnace operations at Kalinganagar, recalled that operators never became comfortable with a model that had been created to help improve the stability of the blast furnace: “Most people spend 20 or 30 years learning how to operate a blast furnace. They thought that the model would be this magical solution. When the initial output from the model didn’t match their beliefs, they couldn’t understand why. They weren’t convinced it would work. The buy-in wasn’t there.” Supporting an analytics transformation: A leader’s view by Rajiv Kumar After the first phase of the analytics transformation at Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, I saw that managers needed to put more emphasis on developing the capabilities of the plant’s workforce. I also recognized that I should make the transformation a top priority. This kind of transformation succeeds when everyone buys in—and for buy-in to develop, leaders must show they’ve bought in, too. To signal the transformation’s importance, I announced that Kalinganagar wouldn’t undertake any other big initiatives until the plant had developed the capabilities to build and deploy analytics solutions on its own. Consistency and stability are important in steelmaking, so changing the way we do things can be hard. I knew that if everyone’s attention was divided between multiple change initiatives, the analytics transformation would be more likely to slow down or stall out. I also began holding “skip-level meetings” with junior members of our workforce who were being trained as analytics specialists or learning to use analytics in frontline jobs. The analytics work wasn’t easy, so I wanted to hear firsthand about it, just as I do when I walk around the plant and talk to equipment operators and technicians. Having a feel for how things are going on the plant floor is important. Then, in the second phase of the transformation, I required managers from the plant to give updates on the analytics projects they were working on. All my questions went to Tata Steel employees as well. It was another way to reinforce the idea that analytics is part of how our plant now operates. Rajiv Kumar is vice president of operations for Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Doubling down on capabilities The model-building exercise confirmed what leaders at Kalinganagar had expected: that analytics could deliver significant and valuable performance improvements. It also convinced leaders to make further investments in employees’ capabilities so they could sustain the performance improvements and take analytics into other areas . In mid-2018, leaders chose to initiate a second phase of the program in which analytics specialists and frontline operators would develop and implement models to aid their decisions and receive hands-on training in analytics, with McKinsey’s help. For the team building the superheating model, analytics specialists from Tata Steel took a refresher course in the skills they’d studied at the academy. Then they were assigned to perform certain development tasks—augmenting the user interface, simplifying the database, retraining the model, deploying new modeling techniques and approaches—in collaboration with experienced practitioners from McKinsey. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists were assigned to perform development tasks in collaboration with experienced practitioners. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists also spent extra time working with the employees who controlled the superheating process at the secondary-metallurgy station. They asked more questions about the process to fine-tune the model. Specialists watched the operators at work and talked with them about ways of making the model easier to use. Operators cited numerous difficulties, from faulty computer hardware to clunky user interfaces, that the analytics team helped resolve. The analytics team explained how they had developed the model and how it worked, because they wanted operators to trust its recommendations. “All the employees at Kalinganagar had been trained to make decisions based on their experience. When problems happened, they would try to solve them with physical equations—put in raw materials and heat, get a certain output. They do look at data. But with data science, they can connect many more data points than we can with physical science. Even if they don’t have a physical equation to explain why something is happening, they can still figure it out with data. That was a new belief system that had to be built up,” said Chatterjee. After around six months, the superheating squad had built a model capable of recommending process set points that would raise the superheating strike rate to 90 percent. Now it was time for frontline operators to begin using the model on a regular basis. Managers kept track of who used the model and who didn’t and celebrated the accomplishments of the most devoted users. Employees went from following 60 percent of the model’s recommendations to following 85 percent in a couple of months. Taking analytics to scale When the second phase concluded, the plant’s leadership raised the bar once more. They called for a third phase, in which Tata Steel employees would select, lead, and deliver analytics projects related to each of the plant’s main areas: core processes, power, and utilities. McKinsey consultants would move into coaching roles on the employee-led project teams. To focus their efforts, these teams set improvement goals for more than 25 performance indicators, such as the daily tonnage of pig iron produced by the plant’s blast furnace. Because several of those indicators pertained to the superheating process, it again emerged as a priority for analytics work. The plant’s analytics specialists had learned enough about data science by then to take charge of the superheating model. They narrowed its target temperature range. They also added the ability to predict how much cooling would take place between the secondary-metallurgy station and the casting station. This helped operators manage the transfer better and increase throughput. Frontline operators followed the model’s recommendations even more closely. As a result, the superheating model produced the annual cost savings of $4 million that had been estimated at the outset of the analytics program. Comparable gains accrued elsewhere in the plant. For each of the 25-plus performance indicators, teams realized at least 80 percent of the targeted improvements. Their efforts yielded $70 million to $80 million of value and two to three percentage points of EBITDA 1 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. uplift. And in July 2019, the World Economic Forum announced that an independent panel of experts in the Fourth Industrial Revolution had recognized the Kalinganagar plant’s digital achievements as leading edge and named it a Lighthouse facility —making it the first such plant in India. Looking ahead The Kalinganagar plant now has a cohort of more than 30 analytics specialists, including data scientists and translators. The most experienced have become in-house instructors and coaches and are responsible for helping other colleagues learn new skills in data science, business-case development, and other key domains. With analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support. Analytics knowledge has also suffused the plant’s day-to-day work, changing the way that many employees solve problems. As Shailendra Rai, the head of blast-furnace operations, said, “If you talk to five blast furnace operators, they will have five different opinions about how to solve a problem. In a way, all five are correct—everyone’s speaking based on their own experience. But with analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support.” With these capabilities, managers have drawn up a slate of more than 20 additional use cases, and they are reinforcing the use of analytics where it’s already in place. For Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, analytics has become more than a tool for answering questions—it’s an integral part of the plant’s operations and culture.

When the 36th edition began in early March, the race’s defending champion, Emirates Team New Zealand, hit the water having utilized a new crewmember: an AI bot created by McKinsey. It turned out to be a winning combination. On March 17, the Kiwis successfully defended their title against the Italian challengers, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, winning their fourth America’s Cup. The America’s Cup has always been as much about technology and innovation as it is about sailing. Boat designs are governed by the competition’s “ Class Rule , ” which leaves small opportunities for design tweaks that might give one team an advantage over another. If brilliantly seized, those opportunities can translate into a shining race-day performance. Our goal was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. The Class Rule for this year’s race, published in March 2018, required the two competing teams to sail a 75-foot vessel. It’s not your typical sailboat. Hydrofoils fixed to the hull lift the entire craft out of the water, enabling it to reach speeds exceeding 60 mph, or 100 kph. Most importantly, the hydrofoils are one part of the boat where the Class Rule allowed for design modifications, which offered huge competitive advantages for the teams that got those modifications right. Doing so, according to McKinsey senior partner Brian Fox, required intensive testing—and lots of it. “Every boat in the America’s Cup is designed with a computer simulator,” says Brian, who sails competitively. “Whichever team has the best simulator, and uses it most effectively, gains the advantage.” In 2019, Emirates Team New Zealand partnered with McKinsey to begin an innovative project seeking that advantage. What they needed, they soon realized, was a new kind of crew member that could sail thousands of boats at a time. The answer to that call was an AI bot, or software robot, that could test new hydrofoil designs by sailing them on Emirates Team New Zealand’s simulator. Creating value beyond the hype The simulator had been key to the team’s victory in 2017; the sailors had used it to test new boat designs without having to actually build them. But that simulator required multiple team members using it simultaneously for it to work properly. This was a logistical challenge, given the sailors’ scheduled practices, travel, and competitions. “Our goal,” Brian explains, “was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. By developing an AI bot that could run the simulator by itself, we no longer had to manage around the sailors’ limited availability.” As a first step, the McKinsey team, which included colleagues from our analytics firm QuantumBlack , turned to the cloud. Over six-weeks, data, analytics, and machine-learning experts from Sydney, Melbourne, and London migrated New Zealand’s simulator and developed an infrastructure to run it in the cloud. Then our team used a new and innovative approach called deep reinforcement learning to essentially teach the AI bot how to become a professional sailor. The technique allowed the bot to learn dynamically and gain greater accuracy through continuous feedback. Nic Hohn , one of the key project leaders, explains. “When you start, the AI agent knows nothing and learns by trial and error using countless variables—wind speed, direction, adjustments to the 14 different sail and boat controls—and is refined again and again,” Nic says. “Since the bot keeps experimenting, if you coach it to learn in the right way, it compresses into hours what would take a human years to understand.” This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat. The work was highly technical, according to QuantumBlack’s chief scientist Jacomo Corbo, and it required  extensive innovation around the bot’s learning program. “At this point in the project, a lot of creative thinking had to be done to figure out the right learning models, how best to coach the bot, and the right guard rails and rewards to put into place.” The team also created a network that allowed multiple bots to share information as they each learned to sail. This was a critical breakthrough, as it allowed the individual bots to gain knowledge from their collective experience. Ultimately, there were a thousand bots running in parallel, learning from each other. “It's learning at a huge scale and it dramatically reduces the time and cost of the project,” says Nic. “That's the power of the cloud.” Within two weeks, the bot was sailing in a straight line, upwind and downwind. After mastering the basics, it graduated to more complex sailing maneuvers. The turning point came about eight weeks later, when the AI bot started beating the sailors in the simulator. At this point, the bot became the ideal way to test variations of the hydrofoils; it was more consistent and more scalable than the sailors, speeding the cycles of design iterations dramatically. “This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat,” observes Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and member of the QuantumBlack leadership team in Europe, who is also a world champion sailor. Soon, the sailors were learning maneuvers from the bot. “With such a steep development curve, accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable,” explains Oliver Fleming , an expert associate partner, “both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, the bot sped New Zealand’s design process by a factor of ten. The race’s outcome proves that reinforcement learning can be a transformational tool for process design, with potential applications across industries. “This has been one of the most complex deployments of deep reinforcement learning in the public cloud,” says Jacomo. “One way to think about the difficulty of the problem: game-tree complexity roughly tallies the size of the space one has to navigate while accounting for the set of possible game paths, or the sequence of decisions, that need to be taken. Go , which is an extremely complex board game, has a game-tree complexity of 170—our sailing problem has a game-tree complexity of nearly 2900.” Mastering such technical complexity, particularly in this application, has heightened this project’s excitement for everyone involved. “It is thrilling to be using technology and AI to master the wind and water and go as fast as you possibly can,” says Nic. “This is not sailing as we know it—it's much closer to flying a low-altitude aircraft.” To learn more about our work in AI, visit QuantumBlack .

Built by Facebook with help from Google, the cables could boost data capacity to southeast Asia’s largest economy by 70 percent. The project, which is still subject to government approval, would be a boon to Indonesia’s connected users, who are among the savviest in the region and beyond. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Today, the nation comprises the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in the world. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Telkomsel has been an engine of that growth. The world’s seventh-largest mobile operator and the largest in Southeast Asia, the mobile-communications provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable, inclusive digital economy for Indonesia’s nearly 200 million internet users. It has dramatically increased Indonesia’s broadband access, helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) digitize, and led the nation’s transition from 3G to 4G before becoming the first operator to launch 5G there in May 2021. Telkomsel has long recognized the value of continuous innovation. When it looked to ensure its platform would remain the primary way its customers engage with the world—and win a new generation of customers—the 26-year-old incumbent decided to embark on a big, bold transformation. A plan to transform The move wouldn’t be easy, but Telkomsel felt it had an obligation to its customers, who had come to rely on the provider’s ability to meet their digital demands. So the organization called on a cross-functional team of data-domain experts from QuantumBlack and venture builders, designers, and strategy consultants from Leap by McKinsey to initiate a large-scale digital program aimed at reinventing the way customers experience Telkomsel in daily life. As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel knew it had to engage and strengthen its relevance with Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer segment. The average data-hungry Gen Z consumer in Indonesia spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone, using it to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. The program was built on three core pillars. Telkomsel wanted to build a new data analytics platform to better understand its customers and drive personalization; create and launch new businesses to reach underserved consumers; and launch a new digital channel that would streamline and simplify the way customers engage with Telkomsel’s services. Understanding customers Telkomsel’s leaders knew that providing customers with the best products and services would require putting data to smart use. The company developed new analytics capabilities that allowed it to enhance customers’ experiences and start the journey toward hyper-personalizing its services. Telkomsel began by building a new platform that contains more than 9,000 data points for each consumer, which was fully modular and reusable across business units. This gave the company a single, near-real-time view of customer behavior that could be used to improve experience across the entire consumer journey, from marketing and customer service to network operations, back-office support, and more. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. They also moved from manual data uploads to automated data pipelines and quality checks, which improved data quality and speed, and enabled more accurate and faster decision-making. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. Every month, Telkomsel runs more than 50 analytical models, based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, to identify the right way to interact with their customers and offer them propositions that are most relevant to them. The move toward hyper-personalization has allowed Telkomsel to better tailor their offers for customers. Today, these services and offerings already account for 50 percent of the telco’s overall revenues. Creating value beyond the hype Launching new businesses As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel moved to engage and strengthen its relevance with new consumer segments. For instance, the company needed to enhance its relevance to those underserved by traditional home broadband infrastructure. They also wanted to reach Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer audience, which spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. In order to move at their desired speed, Telkomsel would need to launch new brands and value propositions, which would require them to embrace a different culture, agile ways of working, and a fit-for-purpose technological stack through new business-building. In the end, they launched two new brands. Orbit: Expanding connectivity for underserved segments Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. Even as Indonesia rapidly digitized, fixed broadband access was not uniform, with just 15 percent of households using it to get online. To provide wireless connectivity to those who lacked fixed broadband, Telkomsel built and launched a new business called Orbit, which provides customers with a home router that uses 4G mobile cellular services instead of fiber optics. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. It includes a mobile app to check usage, top up on data, and manage router settings, such as parental controls. Orbit has doubled its one-year customer acquisition goal, with more than 35 percent of customers joining from its referral program, a testament to its popularity and market demand. Today, Orbit is seeing 20 percent month-over-month growth. By.U: Reaching Generation Z Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. Telkomsel didn’t have the kind of brand association among the digital natives it wanted to serve and delight. A cross-functional team of product managers, customer design experts and venture builders developed, built, and launched by.U, an all-digital telco experience. The platform allows users to select a pre-paid SIM card that arrives at their doorstep, activate their number remotely, manage top-ups and quotas, make payments, and more. By.U was built at pace. The team created a series of social-media tests to observe click-through rates on certain features, which allowed the team to develop and tune the minimum-viable product quickly. When Telkomsel beta-launched the brand, they quickly had 30,000 customers join the waitlist. The brand reached its one-year customer acquisition goal in half that time. Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. And to help ensure innovation continued post-launch, the by.U team established an agile-organization structure. Simplifying and enhancing engagement The app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. The goal of Telkomsel’s third pillar could be simply stated: to make customers’ interactions with the company as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible. But it was complicated to achieve. Telkomsel already had a self-serve mobile app, and the team initially set out to make changes there to improve the customer journey. However, as customer expectations for what an app could do rose—digital payments and loyalty programs, for example—so did pressure on the app’s infrastructure. It soon became clear that there was more value to be had in starting fresh. Delivering a new app is always complex. In this case, a core technology transition to a micro-services-based architecture proved to be the unlock. It also meant shaping a rigorous product-development strategy and creating a new commercial strategy to encourage uptake. But it was all worth it. With the launch of the award-winning MyTelkomsel, the company was able to offer customers more transparency around their usage, going from SMS-triggered alerts to an immediate, real-time view, as well as provide personalized packages tailored to their needs. Customer experience around digital payments became seamless, while an ecosystem with digital-retail partners let Telkomsel customers redeem loyalty points for products. Elsewhere, gamification mechanics allowed customers to earn badges that qualified them for free data allowances. The app also enabled access to new digital services, including video and gaming, and easier access to e-payment options through services like LinkAja, GoPay, OVO, Dana, and ShopeePay. All of this meant serving customers in more dynamic, exciting, and tailored ways. Today the app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. All aboard: Recruiting digital talent to sustain innovation Telkomsel knew that technology was only one part of the transformation equation. Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform—no matter how powerful—would perform to potential or withstand technological evolution. They also saw the potential in this partnership to help cultivate digital skills in Indonesia’s workforce, strengthening a commitment to building a center of excellence for Indonesian digital talent. They launched a new, agile recruitment process to attract, onboard, and train 40+ of Indonesia’s strong digital talent across data science, software engineering, product ownership and UX design. This entailed a whole new talent management approach – reinventing employer branding, carving out career paths for new profiles like data engineers and translators, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling existing analytics professionals. Over the course of several months, Telkomsel hired candidates across 12 newly created digital and data analytics roles, and set up seven cross-functional agile squads to catalyze the adoption of new ways of working. The end-product was a data management platform and new businesses - made in Indonesia, for Indonesians, by Indonesians. Culture, capabilities, and resilience Inside the company, its most enduring returns may also be among its least tangible: An emerging culture of innovation and agility; new capabilities and competencies; a new confidence in taking bold leaps through new ventures; and a commitment to long-term, sustainable transformation. Such traits, for example, enabled Telkomsel to help its customers through COVID-19. They quickly ensured their customers had fully-remote, digital services at their fingertips, and they were able to offer new packages that were tailored to what their customers needed and could afford at any given time. The telco industry is essential to our modern economies, enabling nearly every facet of remote connectivity, from online meetings to e-commerce to telehealth. It’s a sector in which it can feel like there’s little room for failure—and perhaps not always enough room for innovation. Telkomsel’s story is proof that innovation is not just valuable but critical; and that it can pay off when an organization commits to transformation at every level. Its digital journey has touched the lives of hundreds of millions of Indonesians, through personalization at-scale to enhance the experience of all its customers, new brands tailored to its digital-first users, and a new app that adds convenience to customers’ daily lives.

Welders spend long hours on their feet and often work outside: on bridges, at race tracks, in oil fields, and other sites. Welding strains eyesight, the neck, and shoulders. Fumes are toxic and burns common. For 40 years, our Sweden-based design team has collaborated first with Speedglas and then with 3M to design, and continually improve, welding helmets. With every product cycle, the joint team started from scratch, reimagining and redesigning the helmets, with innovations that sometimes shifted the entire industry. Our partnership has helped to improve welders’ safety and comfort under dangerous and strenuous working conditions. It started in 1983 when a tiny company called Speedglas invented a new type of welding glass. It darkened automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc, freeing welders from having to constantly “nod” the shield up and down as they worked. Other innovations over the years included a device that pivots the shield up and back over the crown of the head, rather than resting at the forehead, easing neck pain. Internal padding that skirted pressure points, reducing headaches. A two-way fan system that improved breathability. A textile covering that captured stray glass crystals. A curved design for glass that extended peripheral vision. Our partnership has produced seven signature helmet designs, with accessories, which have won 11 international awards, including a 2021 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award , and are now sold in 60+ countries. But most importantly, our work together has helped to protect welders around the world . Our North Star How do you sustain a 40-year partnership and reinvent the same product in fresh, new ways, again and again? “From our first contact in the mid-80s, we realized that if we worked together we could do something exceptional for our end users: the welders,” reflects Anders Grönberg , the global portfolio leader of welding at 3M. An engineer and market economist by training, Anders has led the development of the helmets for 25+ years, since joining Speedglas in 1990, and then moving on to 3M when it bought the company in 2004. “This has been our common interest during all these years: That we fulfill their needs today and in the future. The fact that we have been successful has, of course, also strengthened the relationship.” When Speedglas was first invented, industries in Sweden were advanced when it came to personal protective equipment. “Organizations were very keen to take care of their users,” recalls Anders. “We got a lot of suggestions and improvements from welders. We took notes with paper and pen and would go back to the office, share the information, and it would grow from there.” “Our North Star has always been to do the research where the welders are most comfortable: at his or her welding bench,” explains Oskar Juhlin , a McKinsey Design alumnus who led the helmet design work from 1983 to 2019. “If you bring someone into a design workshop, office, or other synthetic area, they won’t be as straightforward as they would be in their own environment. We also welded in our own studios, so we could test out the designs ourselves .” Design matters We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design. Early on, it was a challenge to talk to welders about design; at the time it was typically understood to be a field concerned with aesthetics alone. “One guy told me ‘I don’t care about how it looks, as long as I like it,’” he remembers. “Many welders work on race cars. Well it was a different story when I said, ‘So it doesn’t matter what wheels you put on your car?’ Yes, it does! So, then design is important? We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design.” Over time, the customer base grew to include countries in Asia and the US, where customers were very interested in the helmet technologies and had ideas for improvements. “There were more regulatory requirements to fulfil, so user research expanded into a more formal system,” recalls Anders. “We also realized we had to look beyond the current moment and anticipate the welders’ future needs.” Today, a product road map guides the design planning from three to five years out, with the goal of introducing a new helmet model every two years. “The cycles are getting shorter as the technology is changing more quickly,” says Anders. How we work The typical product cycle begins with the R&D team at 3M presenting the newest technical capabilities to three our four McKinsey industrial designers.  Many have worked together for years. The designers will have a wish list of what they’d like it to look like, as well as new materials, textiles, and fabrics to consider. “You design the helmet with several design concepts, on paper, in computer, foam and clay models, exploring different shapes and trying out materials,” explains Emelie Hedén Edlund , a design director who specializes in color, materials, and finish —or CMF, as it’s known— and worked on the later models. “You touch it, feel it, and then you go back to the computer again. There is a lot of back-and-forth between digital and physical hands-on testing.” The design studio is located in a large converted missionary church in Stockholm, with workshops for sewing, foam and wood working, metal working, and welding. As the design phase unfolds, the joint teams meet in a series of workshops, sitting together for one or two days testing out new prototypes, splitting up to work separately and do homework, and then coming back together to validate new iterations. Then they go to the welders to try out the prototypes and confirm they are moving in the right direction. If so, they go on to the next stage: the critical step of ensuring that the helmet model can be manufactured in high volumes . Hans Nyström , associate design director at McKinsey, recalls one inspiring meeting. “The extended 3M team and our designers were at the table, discussing a very complicated prototype. And it was clear that it weighed too much. No one wanted to raise their hand and say ‘it’s my work that’s causing this.’”  On the spur of the moment, the McKinsey team proposed a workshop: to get tools and drills out, then and there, and find ways to cut the weight. Together the entire team looked at every component—drill a hole here, nip away material there. They lost ounces. “From that experience, we all saw a better way of working. By sharing the common goal, it changed the whole mindset of the team,” Emelie said. “It doesn’t feel like a client relationship, but like a partnership.” “It feels good to work with a partner who has so much trust,” says Hans. “3M has an appreciation of good design—we share that as a starting point. We complement each other skill-wise. They have the deep technical and mechanical expertise while we focus on the design and exterior surfaces. We are on the same software systems, so it’s a seamless integrated workflow. Together we share a wealth of knowledge.” Giving emotional resonance to a functional object Over the years, our designers have drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources including medieval knights, superheroes, ergonomics, and Chinese acupressure. But for many, the helmet model closest to their hearts is the 9000 launched in 1996. It was the first time user research had been incorporated into every step, and it was a major departure in design. The shape of the helmet morphed from a square mailbox into a mask that felt more like a natural extension of the wearer’s face. “The design team had a lot of discussions with the welders about the emotional aspects or character we wanted to express,” explains Hans. “It had to be very professional, powerful. Welders are very proud of their work–just think of the image of Rosie the Riveter, who was a welder. This was the heritage of the profession. If it were in a movie, the helmet would have to be fit for a hero knight on a black dragon.” Designers introduced a ridge down the middle of the helmet face to suggest the look of armor and expressed trust through open forehead lines and other facial nuances. The ‘line of sight’ is angled downward, focused on the hands—the work. This model also incorporated the ability to exhale through side vents. “At the time, they were actually put on mannequins in the windows of one of Stockholm’s finest department stores as a fashion item because they looked so cool,” recalls Emelie. “They went from being a very functional object to having an emotional element.” The helmet would be cited as an example of ‘futuristic’ design for the next ten years. After it was launched in 1996, the strikingly futuristic 3M Speedglas 9000 helmet was displayed on mannequins in the department store Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm. Breathing easier Three years later, the team introduced the Speedglas Adflo, an air-purifying respirator that circulated air to reduce heat and improve breathability. It was a fan attachment that fit snugly down the welder’s body, fastened with a belt at the waist. This tight profile reduced the risk of the welder getting snagged on the equipment. “It was a revolutionary change,” said Oskar. “All of the other fans on the market had a round filter attached to the back which looked like a mushroom. By 2014, we went to a trade show, and every fan on market had this tight, streamlined look—our design had moved the market.” Last year, 3M launched the G5-02 for highly precise TIG welding. The helmet holds the world’s first curved glass shield, a design that follows the shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This year, it won the Red Dot award with a Best of the Best distinction. Looking ahead, Oskar predicts: “The helmets will become almost like a second skin, with softer, high-tech materials rather than hard plastic which is bulky, uncomfortable, noisy. Shields are already connected to blue tooth so you can maneuver equipment with a phone; there will be developments with cameras and video, and radar may be used for detecting the target, rather than light.” The evening news While the awards and external praise are gratifying, some of the most satisfying recognition has come from welders themselves. “We have had many, many stories, but there are a couple that are more famous within 3M,” Anders says. “We had a welder here in Sweden who we were visiting at his work site. We had just introduced the respiratory protection together with the helmet. After a moment’s thought, he said that he liked the helmet now because he could actually watch the late news on television. Before he began using the respirator, he was so tired that he would fall asleep before the news had started. That was an indication to us that the product that we had supplied to the market was actually helping to improve our users’ quality of life. It is a huge motivation for all of the people in our company to continue working with this kind of product.” For Oskar, the ultimate recognition came with the futuristic 9100 series. “Some welders tattooed themselves with images of that shield,” says Oskar. “That says something about our design.” Related Practices Design | Operations | Technology Related Articles How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger How award-winning design is helping older adults live safely and with dignity at home", "summary": "For 40 years, a collaboration between 3M and Speedglas has revolutionized welding helmet design, enhancing safety and comfort.

With partnership from Spirit AeroSystems and McKinsey, they reached unprecedented new production heights.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/how-we-help-clients/a-manufacturing-moonshot", "image_url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/operations/how%20we%20help%20clients/a%20manufacturing%20moonshot/vyaire_thumb_workers_591168885_1536x1536.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&car=16:9&cpy=Center", "date": "2022-04-06T12:00:00Z", "article_text": "How a manufacturing moonshot was made In March 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, the New York Times ran a story under the headline: “There aren’t enough ventilators to cope with the coronavirus.” It explained that the number of ventilators in the world at the time could not meet the rising demand of patients seriously afflicted with the disease. There appeared to be no solution. The complexity of the devices, whose supply chains comprise hundreds of specialized manufacturers scattered across the globe, made production surges seemingly impossible. “Italy wanted to order 4,000,” a European manufacturer told the paper, “but there’s not a chance.” Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, an effort was underway that would unite a group of optimists and problem solvers from Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, McKinsey, and an array of Vyaire’s suppliers. Together, they embarked on an ambitious quest to dramatically increase ventilator production, thereby giving medical professionals a chance to better care for critically ill patients. Before it was all said and done, the venture would put thousands of furloughed people back to work, stand up a new ventilator-manufacturing facility, and bolster links in far-flung supply chains on the way to hitting a production rate that would deliver nearly a years’ worth of ventilators every three days . “At Vyaire, we take pride in accepting and facing challenges that others might shy away from,” says Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal. “In this case, we achieved something others might not dare to imagine.” Beyond business as usual The history of mechanical ventilation goes back hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until the polio epidemics of the early 20th century that the devices were widely used. Among the most well-known was the Drinker respirator, or “iron lung,” which looked like a mini submarine and was powered by vacuum-cleaner motors. They’ve come a long way since then. Today, these devices are the size of a large briefcase and utilize multiple circuit boards, complex software, and hundreds of components to control things like air pressure, flow rate, oxygen level, humidity, and temperature. Their engineering has more in common with aerospace systems than with household appliances. Ventilators are much scarcer than either of those things, however, and the outbreak of COVID-19 introduced a vast and widening gulf between supply and demand. In April of 2020, for instance, a McKinsey team looking at global medical supplies estimated that there were about 23 ventilators per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the most plentiful supply. “In Africa,” says Miyu Toyoshima Galliart, a McKinsey associate partner, “the region with the lowest supply according to the analysis, the estimate was fewer than one [ventilator] per 100,000 people.” Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth “To call this extraordinary-demand scenario ‘unprecedented’ would be a gross understatement,” says McKinsey partner Ron Ritter, who helped lead the effort. “Nothing about ventilators—their supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, service, or support—was ever designed for anything like what happened with COVID-19.” Typical ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day. Vyaire’s production team suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Of course, Vyaire’s operations were built for typical demand—not the increased needs of a pandemic. Its usual ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day, which is a lot considering the complexity, quality-control requirements, and capital-asset value. (By comparison, the highest-demand commercial aircraft in modern history never once exceeded a production rate of 60 per month. While different in many ways, both are highly engineered capital assets.) In April of 2020, Vyaire’s main ventilator product line suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Making that number would require a ramp in production toward 700 units a day in a matter of weeks. “Our executive team heard the concern in the voices of colleagues in the field, who were speaking with clinicians and providers across the world,” says Tammy Noll, senior vice president and general manager of Vyaire’s ventilation franchise. “We knew immediately no amount of business-as-usual was going to work.” So, the company got to work on business-as- unusual . The first step was to maximize output at Vyaire’s Palm Springs, California plant. Joined by industrial engineers from a major auto manufacturer in North America, Vyaire and McKinsey teams worked to revalidate basic manufacturing numbers, dial-in labor, and machinery capacity. Stopwatches and toolboxes in hand, these experts did everything they could—timed process cycles, analyzed bottlenecks, reviewed floor layouts, tweaked machines, and more—to get the most out of the capacity they had at hand. “We started with a spreadsheet,” says Bhavuk Tandon, a McKinsey associate and member of the team walking the factory floor, “and we were conducting time studies on the floor, going through every cell, understanding all the lines and how they worked. We needed that information to help us understand what we had to do to build a facility that [would] give 30 times and more—fast.” Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations. The practice, Ron says, can be an effective first step during critical shortages. “Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations,” he explains. “Finding it normally produces a 20 to 30 percent boost in output right away.” Once the analysis was complete, Vyaire added shifts to the reoptimized line. The moves helped increase production by about threefold. It was a huge leap by industry standards, but well short of what it would take to begin meeting demand. To get there, the company would need to make an even bigger move—to the American heartland. An interview with Vyaire Medical CEO Gaurav Agarwal A new workforce, a new building With its Palm Springs plant running as hard as it could—yet still falling behind demand—Vyaire leaders began working hard to find more workers. “This was about finding an entire second workforce,” says David Marchand, now a McKinsey alum, who helped lead the project. “In a single product line, we needed an estimated 800 people: front-line operators, supervisors, process engineers, maintenance techs, security guards, department leads, site executives, warehouse staff, shipping departments, buyers—and they needed to know how to perform extremely well together, right away.” When needed immediately, a workforce like that can’t be hired incrementally. The only way to acquire one was to locate an intact team—which came from Spirit AeroSystems. The aerospace and medical-device industries may seem like strange bedfellows, but Spirit was the right partner for several reasons. Operationally, their people know industrialization, have high production standards, and operate complex supply chains. And in this case, given COVID-19’s impact on air travel, the company had people who were furloughed and more than ready to get back to work. We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world. This was clearly an international-security-level situation. But beyond that, it was Spirit’s culture that made them the perfect fit. According to Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile, “Spirit cultivates a ‘can be done,’ mission-oriented culture that has been built on accepting challenges.” This challenge tapped the company’s core values of transparency, collaboration, and inspiration, and it inspired the combined workforce of over 1000 employees. “We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world,” says Tom. “This was clearly an international-security-level situation.” To get the most out of this workforce, Vyaire looked beyond California in search of more production capacity. They found it 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, where Vyaire decided to open an additional ventilator plant. That may be easy to imagine, but it was hard to execute. Beyond a suitable 55,000 square-foot building, it took machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, quality control, assembly, testing facilities, and much more. Capacities for each manufacturing-process step had to be calculated. Several miles of copper, medical-grade oxygen gas-flow lines, electrical drops, and industrial-grade air compressors had to be installed. Data connectivity to handle huge test-protocol transactions with cloud-based legacy software needed to be set. Workstations, production tooling, and a range of fixtures had to be built or sourced and calibrated. Even basics like car parking for 200-person shifts, break rooms, badging, security, and fire-control had to be installed. Most critically, Vyaire and Spirit had to design and build workforce COVID-19 safety, including social-distancing fixtures, temperature screening, reporting, and testing protocols. “We were hyper focused on providing a safe environment for every single person who was about to work in that building,” says Noll. “We also knew the risk of outbreak in this facility carried added weight. Not only were we concerned about their health and that of their families, but we were also cognizant that the consequences of illness there would be felt by patients in need of these devices across the globe.” Vyaire and Spirit were now ready to chase a benchmark that, months prior, would’ve only existed in a company’s wildest dreams. All they needed now were enough parts to make it a reality. Supply-chain reaction Supply-chain operations make and deliver tangible aspects of our lives and create the fundamental material pathways in a functioning society. Unappreciated in normal times, they rush to the forefront in times of crisis, such as the great wars and most recently, COVID-19. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. During COVID-19, these suppliers were just as pressed as Vyaire. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. Much of their supply-chain expense sits among fasteners, precision-machined valves, resin-molded components, electronic circuits, batteries, and more. During COVID-19, the plants that manufacture these components were just as pressed as Vyaire. Versions of the same efficiency processes happening in Palm Springs and Wichita unfolded in hundreds of operations across the ventilator supply chain. The effectiveness of these moves was critical to boosting output, but they were harder for Vyaire to control. The suppliers medical-device manufacturers use were scattered globally. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they were often hit by competing demands. For example, an electronics manufacturer that makes medical-device circuit boards could see a wave of demand for virtual-work devices. Suppliers did their best to respond. Many found ways to ramp-up quickly and help get Vyaire and Spirit what they needed. Others lost adjacent demand and had capacity to spare. But in some cases, suppliers lost capacity or had exceedingly long lead times. The most critical of these situations—the ones whose projected output would limit the team’s target rate—were placed on a “red list.” Early on, the red list was long. “It was apparent that dozens of material sources might hold us back,” says Jenna Stauffer, a McKinsey engagement manager who worked on supply chains in the effort. Clearing the red list would require advanced intervention. A group comprising Vyaire’s most experienced buyers and manufacturing experts worked directly with suppliers to get specific information on process flows, bottleneck constraints, shipping delays, and the company’s own component constraints. In most cases, these interventions worked. But in extreme cases, teams cleared to travel during COVID-19 lockdown conditions worked directly with vendors on site. In one example, a European producer of pressure transducers emerged as a key constraint. Teams traveled to the plant, mapped the entire process flow, and installed IoT sensors on a key rate-determining step in a single day. The work provided live, digital tracking of actual production against the max potential rate, and it helped the site raise its output within 48 hours. The red list work was among the most relentless of the entire effort. It went on around the clock daily, as time zones rolled through the global night, demanding nonstop problem solving for months. The impossible made possible—by people If machines and technology were this effort’s arms and legs, people—many of whom have never met in person to this day—were its head and heart. They were united through a relentless drive to help, a product of the cultures at both Vyaire and Spirit, and they had the skills necessary to do so. “Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring,” says Catherine-Sophie Haigh, a McKinsey operations specialist who worked on the project. “Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity, and they trusted the teammate by their side—in many cases by their ‘virtual’ side.” Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring. Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity. This was especially evident around one of the initiative’s most critical moments. When it became clear that the Palm Springs plant would never have the capacity to hit rising target rates, and splitting focus between it and the Wichita plant was sapping energy, leaders decided to execute what became known as “lift and shift” to consolidate the entire operation under a single roof. This meant shutting down the key ventilator production lines in the California plant over a weekend, crating all production equipment, and moving it as quickly and safely as possible to Kansas. Given the stakes, the risk of losing equipment in transit, having it not restart, or suffering irreparable damage was frightening. “I’d done something like this on a smaller scale before,” says McKinsey partner Jonathan Tilley, who helped lead the effort. “It’s not plug and play. I was nervous, and we all knew what a loss in output meant for people who needed ventilators.” During removal, teams would video-record and catalogue every screw, bolt, and connector to help the receiving teams put it all back together. The transit process was scrutinized for weather conditions and other variables. The team even consulted a satellite manufacturer to learn about preventing vibration damage en route to the new facility. “This entire move was conceived, decided, and completed in less than ten days,” Jonathan adds. “By working together, we all pulled it off.” The “lift and shift” success turned out to be one proof point in a massive success story. As the project progressed into the fall of 2020, Vyaire’s global delivery of ventilators crossed 35,000, with peak rates of more than 600 per day sustained on one product line, with more than 1,000 across all. “I still remember when the call came across to join this effort,” says McKinsey senior expert and associate partner Phil Duncan, who helped lead the work. “It was one of those moments in your career when you know you’ve just got to do it. It was a little nerve-wracking at points. It was emotional and meaningful. We all have a ton of pride in this because we did the work together.” Ten lessons on supply-chain readiness. By Ron Ritter Vyaire and Spirit got so much right in this unprecedented effort. Here’s what we learned from them. There is tremendous gain in getting this ever more right, as Vyaire and Spirit have shown us. Routine cost and delivery performance can improve through everyday enhancements across the organization. Stronger, more confident, and better-prepared organizational talent will build lasting culture around a sense of purpose. More rigorous design standards and better supplier networks are better able to respond with resiliency, and the brand will be stronger and more credible in projecting to the market. In normal days, operations will deliver better, faster, cheaper, safer. In a crisis, it may make all the difference in a decisive response. At peak, Vyaire was producing more ventilators in three days than their entire 2019 output. Over 19,000 units were built in the Kansas factory in just over 12 weeks by Spirit’s workforce. Similar feats were accomplished at other plants around the world, including among thousands of component suppliers. “We all worked together to create a state-of-the-art ventilator-production operation, supply chain, logistics, and workforce in less than six weeks that sent critical devices to patients in need around the world,” says Spirit’s CEO Tom Gentile. “I could not be prouder of what we all have done.” Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal agrees. “Yes, it was bold, and daunting at times, but there was never a chance we weren’t going to stand up to this moment,” he says. “Patients and customers were counting on us and our collective teams to meet the challenge.” This particular moment may have passed, and critical-care ventilator demand has since eased, but according to McKinsey’s Ron Ritter, the campaign nevertheless stands as an epic industrial success: “It also says a lot about what organizations can do when they have the courage to face what feels like an impossible objective, and inspire their people to do the same.” Related Practice To learn more about how McKinsey helps organizations improve manufacturing, please visit our Operations website , where you can also gain insight into CEO leadership of operations, supply-chain resilience , and much more.", "summary": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vyaire Medical and Spirit AeroSystems rapidly increased ventilator production by uniting teams, optimizing manufacturing processes, and opening a new facility in Kansas.

That was when Wayne Brown, the operations manager at the Vistra-owned Martin Lake Power Plant, built and deployed a heat rate optimizer (HRO). About Vistra and its emissions-reduction goals Vistra Corp. is the largest competitive power producer in the United States and operates power plants in 12 states with a capacity of more than 39,000 megawatts of electricity—enough to power nearly 20 million homes. Vistra has committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent by 2030 (against a 2010 baseline) and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve its goals, the business is increasing efficiency in all its power plants and transforming its generation fleet by retiring coal plants and investing in solar- and battery-energy storage, which includes the world’s largest grid-scale battery energy-storage facility. Vistra’s to path to net zero will also require it to grow its zero-carbon portfolio to more than 7000 megawatts by 2026. The “heat rate” is a measure of the thermal efficiency of the plant—the amount of fuel required for each unit of electricity produced. To reach the optimal heat rate, plant operators continuously monitor and tune hundreds of variables, or “set points” on things like steam temperatures, pressures, oxygen levels, and fan speeds. It’s a lot for any operator to get right 100 percent of the time—so Vistra thought AI could help. Partnering for innovation With this goal in mind, Wayne and his group worked together with a McKinsey team that included data scientists and machine learning engineers from QuantumBlack AI by McKinsey , to build a multilayered neural-network model—essentially an algorithm powered by AI that learns about the effects of complex nonlinear relationships. This model went through two years’ worth of data at the plant and learned which combination of external factors—such as temperature and humidity—and internal decisions, like set points that operators control, would optimize the algorithm and attain the best heat-rate efficiency at any point in time. Vistra team members provided continuous guidance about the intricacies of how the plant worked, and identified critical data sources from sensors, which helped McKinsey engineers refine the model, adding and removing variables to see how those changes affected the heat rate. Through this training process, and by introducing better data, the models “learned” to make ever more accurate predictions. When the models were accurate to 99 percent or higher and run through a rigorous set of real-world tests, a McKinsey team of machine learning engineers converted them into an AI-powered engine. This generated recommendations every 30 minutes for operators to improve the plant’s heat-rate efficiency. At a meeting with all of Vistra’s leaders to review the HRO, Lloyd Hughes, a seasoned operations manager at the company’s Odessa plant, said, “There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon.” There are things that took me 20 years to learn about these power plants. This model learned them in an afternoon. With this kind of power at their fingertips, Wayne and his team could make better, more informed decisions. Acting on the HRO recommendations helped Martin Lake run more than two percent more efficiently after just three months in operation, resulting in $4.5 million per year in savings and 340,000 tons of carbon abated. This carbon reduction was the equivalent of taking 66,000 cars off the road. 1 Calculations based on “ Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References “, United States Environmental Protection Agency If that doesn’t sound like a lot, consider this: companies that build gas-fueled power plants invest millions of dollars in research and development over four to five years to achieve a one-percent improvement in power-generation efficiency. Vistra hit that improvement level in only one-twentieth the amount of time using the data and equipment it already had. 2 Calculations based on source material from “A Brief History of GE Gas Turbines”, Power , July 8, 2019, and Frequently asked questions, US Energy Information Administration, last reviewed September 20, 2021 Creating value beyond the hype Vistra has since rolled the HRO out to another 67 power-generation units across 26 plants, for an average one-percent improvement in efficiency, and more than $23 million in savings. Along with the other AI initiatives, these efforts have helped Vistra abate about 1.6 million tons of carbon per year, which is ten percent of its remaining 2030 carbon-reduction commitment. That’s equivalent to offsetting about 50 percent of what a 500-megawatt coal plant emits. What happened at Martin Lake has happened at dozens of Vistra’s other power plants, with more than 400 AI models (and counting) deployed across the company’s fleet to help operators make even better decisions. It also reflects a core trait of Vistra’s AI transformation, which is that it isn’t a story of one massive hit, but rather the story of dozens of meaningful improvements snowballing to deliver significant value in terms of accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth. It’s also the story of how an organization architected an approach to rapidly scale every successful AI solution across the entire business. And it’s a story of how a continuous improvement culture, combined with a powerful AI modeling capability, helped leaders and plant operators do their jobs better than ever before. With more than $60 million captured in about one year of work and another $40 million in progress, Vistra is well on its way to delivering against a roadmap of $250-$300 million in identified EBITDA and more than two million tons of carbon abatement per year. The AI-driven advances at Vistra have heralded a generational shift in the power sector in terms of improvements in efficiency, reliability, safety, and sustainability.\nIf the one-percent improvement in efficiency the HRO delivered across the fleet was carried across all coal- and gas-fired plants in the US electric-power generation industry, 15 million tons of carbon would be abated annually—the equivalent of decommissioning more than two large coal plants or planting about 37 million trees. 3 The tree equivalency is based on calculations derived from the “The global tree restoration potential” study, published in the journal Science, July 5, 2019. That means less fuel needed to deliver power to the hospitals, schools, and businesses that rely on it. AI has the potential to bring similar levels of improvement to renewables as well, making them a more cost-effective and attractive energy option. Turning points on the AI journey Healthy skepticism and a culture of favoring action over words at Vistra meant that the biggest hurdle in the AI journey wasn’t the technology: it was the people. Vistra leadership and operations managers needed to know what AI could do and be convinced it could really work. It was this ingrained culture of continuous improvement—alongside a highly competitive market and a commitment to sustainability—that convinced Vistra’s leadership they needed to give AI a chance. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Seeing real possibilities The first question was a relatively simple one: “How can AI help improve the way Vistra generates power?” Answers to that question bubbled over when 50 of Vistra’s top leaders came to a McKinsey-hosted workshop. In multiple sessions, experts explained how AI worked, walked through detailed case studies showing how other companies used analytics and AI to generate value and gave live demonstrations of technologies, including digitized workflows and machine learning. Leaders in analytics from various sectors—including Amazon, Falkonry, Element Analytics, and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, as well as G2VP from the venture-capital world—provided insights and examples of how AI works. “I saw an example of how a metallurgical plant was using AI to help its operators optimize set points and it clicked for me,” remembers Patrick “Cade” Hay, the plant manager for Vistra’s Lamar power plant. “I saw how I could translate that into helping me run my own plants more efficiently. This was my lightbulb moment.” Company leaders and plant managers poured over process flow sheets and engineering diagrams to determine pain points as well as opportunities. This exercise allowed them to focus first on finding where the value was, then secondly on what technologies were needed to deliver it. Many of the operations opportunities were around yield and energy optimization and predictive maintenance, which according to our research, were the top AI use cases for manufacturing industries . By the end of the session, Vistra had developed a strategy to develop a series of AI solutions that could capture $250-$300 million in potential EBITDA while helping the company achieve its 2030 emissions-reductions goals. Codeveloping the AI While the analysis looked promising, proving it in the field was what mattered. “If our plant managers aren’t bought in, then things don’t happen,” explained Barry Boswell, Vistra’s executive vice president of power-generation operations. “So, we said, ‘Let’s pick a leader who is knowledgeable and skeptical, because if we can win them over, we can get everyone.’” They picked Cade. Not only did he run a top-performing plant in terms of profitability, reliability, and heat rate, he had a reputation for telling it like it is—Barry trusted Cade to tell him whether or not the value potential in AI was real. When he approached Cade about testing out a proof of concept to optimize duct burners, he was intrigued but predictably skeptical. Cade saw the potential in AI but was interested in finding out if it could actually help in the field. Duct burners essentially work like afterburners in jet planes; they provide a surge of energy when needed. Operators use them as supplements to hit energy targets, which are known as their “dispatch point.” The issue is that powering duct burners uses more fuel than regular methods, so it’s more expensive, generates more carbon emissions, and increases the wear and tear on equipment. McKinsey subject matter experts, data scientists, and analytics translators from QuantumBlack worked closely with a team from Vistra comprised of power generation and process experts as well as front-line operators to understand how the plant works, what data was available from the sensors already in place, and what variables could be directed—like the fact that the number of cooling fans running could be controlled, while the ambient temperature couldn’t. Working together Denese Ray, operations shift supervisor for Vistra’s Coleto Creek power plant; Doug Richter, the shift supervisor at the same plant; and Muro Kaku, McKinsey analyst and data scientist, discuss how they worked together. Denese: “Every week, I’d bring in a different supervisor to join us for our check-in calls with McKinsey. In this way, Muro and the McKinsey team saw what we were dealing with. We really needed all our supervisors and their feedback to build the model so we could get the most from it.” Muro: “That really mattered. For example, when we first trialed the HRO at the Coleto Creek plant, the recommendations were frequently rejected by the operators. We didn’t know why. When we spoke with the operators, they told us about specific rejection reasons, such as the tool recommended increasing superheat temperature by 30 degrees in a 15-minute interval to maximize the heat rate, but it takes the plant longer to heat up, so they rejected the recommendation. We then added a constraint to the tool to keep the increase and decrease to five degrees in a 15-minute interval, which operators could achieve.” Doug: “During load changes [increase or decrease in power output], the parameters are changing constantly, so recommendations to increase air flow at that time were counterproductive. We worked with McKinsey to have the recommendations stop for 30 minutes while we were changing load until the plant was stable again.” Denese: “We were all pretty skeptical of the tool at first, but when we got to play with the heat rate optimizer and see how it worked, and how well McKinsey worked with us in the plant, we understood how it could help.” As the teams developed the models, plant operators reviewed recommendations to see what made sense, what other variables needed to be tested, and what kinds of recommendations the operators would find most helpful. By analyzing the effect of various inputs and set points on the plant—such as pressure and humidity, the angle of blades in the gas turbine, usage of inlet cooling technologies, and the age and performance of various components like filters and condensers—and running it through the model, the analysis was clear: overall duct-burner usage could be reduced by approximately 30 percent, which would result in the equivalent of $175,000 of yearly savings on fuel costs and wear and tear on the system, in addition to an abatement of about 4,700 tons of carbon per year. “We worked closely with the team from McKinsey to develop AI models that reflected the realities of how power plants operate,” said Cade, “and then when we saw the recommendations coming out of the AI tool, I saw how much real value there was.” Going for scale and adoption from the beginning Vistra’s leadership realized from the beginning that the only way to achieve their efficiency and carbon-abatement aspirations was to scale every solution. “We manage the Vistra fleet as one. If a plant is doing something that works, we want every plant to do it,” says Barry. “That’s what we’re built to do.” That realization led Vistra to invest in a five-part system to scale and sustain AI solutions. *** AI solution deep dive QuantumBlack’s Ayush Talwar, an expert associate partner, provides more details on the AI model development: What kind of models did you use? We used a range of models to fit the specific needs of the plant and the solution. These ranged from Bayesian regression models to deep-learning models. How did you choose which model to use? We wanted to find the right balance between model performance, meaning its accuracy; explainability, which describes relationships to the operators; the source richness, which refers to the amount of data available; potential actionability, or how many of the most important features in the model people can actually control; and maintainability, which will reduce need for more technical skills to maintain them. How would you compare the models you used to older ones? Our models were more accurate than previous models, and importantly, more actionable. We used a variety of metrics to measure model performance such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Our models typically achieved MAPEs of less than 1.5 percent. How did you build up your models? Each neural network model was made up of several layers with each layer containing batch normalization, dropout, and activation. We created cross validation and out-of-sample testing sets using time-based splits to prevent overfitting models. We added features based primarily on domain expertise. How did you turn models into tools operators could use? We used machine learning models to make accurate predictions of outcomes. We then wrapped meta-heuristic optimization algorithms around those models to generate recommendations that helped operators make decisions about how to run the plant better. The models were then embedded within the existing production workflows and deployed live in the operator room. Vistra’s story is far from finished. As Cade put it, “We’re just looking at the tip of the iceberg.” Vistra’s roadmap for 2022 and 2023 includes bringing AI to its rapidly growing renewables fleet of solar and batteries to optimize yield and reliability, among other initiatives. To help sustain this ambition, Vistra is building up its talent bench. In addition to hiring a small team of data scientists and engineers, Rachit has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas to offer basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in AI and analytics for Vistra employees. Some 70 people have already completed courses, including those reskilling from statistics to machine learning. Vistra has also built relationships with local colleges and universities to develop internship programs and work with students in capstone projects to identify top technical talent. “We can’t sit around and just do what we did yesterday to be ready for tomorrow,” Barry says. “We’ve seen enough to know what’s possible.” The authors would like to thank Wayne Brown, Rachit Gupta, Patrick “Cade” Hay, Lloyd Hughes, Denese Ray, and Doug Richter from Vistra Corp., and Richard Bates, Dan Hurley, Pablo Illuzzi, Nephi Johnson, Muro Kaku, Jay Kim, George Lederman, Abhay Prasanna, Noel Ramirez, and Ayush Talwar from McKinsey.

Three days earlier, Reina, 15 at the time, had acted on suicidal thoughts, and Kana spent nearly every hour since searching for mental health crisis resources for adolescents. Everyone told her the same thing: take her to the ER. Kana, who is now the director of brain health at the McKinsey Health Institute, is also a 25-year veteran in the behavioral health arena and knew the ER wouldn’t help her daughter—but there was no other option. The doctor recommended inpatient care, but no beds were available, so for three and a half days, Reina was confined to a glass-walled room under bright lights and constant surveillance, isolated from everyone except her mom, who slept in the hospital chair next to her as they waited for a bed to open up in the adolescent psych unit. “Sitting in an emergency room for days at a time, not being able to get the help your kid needs is devastating,” Kana says. “I had advocated for evidence-based mental health services throughout my career, yet couldn’t find them for my own child.” A growing behavioral health crisis Kana and Reina’s experience isn’t uncommon. In the United States, crises related to behavioral health, a term that refers to both mental and substance use disorders, have been on the rise for more than two decades—particularly among youth. Between 2009 and 2020, the United States saw a 30 percent increase in the national age-adjusted suicide rate. By winter of 2021 , the weekly rate of ER visits by adolescents who attempted suicide was 39 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the average rate for adolescent girls had increased 50 percent over the previous year. Despite these alarming numbers, community crisis-care resources remain limited. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline center, roughly 39 million Americans aged 12 and older could benefit from having access to a service for vulnerable people dealing with suicide, mental health, or substance use issues. Limited crisis services mean law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and ERs end up responding to most behavioral health crises, regardless of whether the individual is a threat to public safety or in need of emergency care. “What we're doing now is services that are high cost and low efficacy,” says Kana. “It’s the wrong recipe.” Dr. John Palmieri is a senior medical advisor and the acting director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Behavioral Health Crisis Team , which includes the 988 Lifeline. He spent the early part of his clinical career working in emergency psychiatric departments and witnessed firsthand the misdirection of care and resources for those in behavioral health crisis. “You see the downstream effects of where the system fails in so many ways when you’re in those settings day after day,” he says. “How are we looking upstream to prevent these crisis situations from happening in the first place or recurring?” A hotline to help those in need The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, passed in 2020, made “988” the official nationwide three-digit behavioral health crisis number as of July 2022. This meant that, for the first time, those experiencing a behavioral health crisis anywhere in the country would only have to remember three digits to find the appropriate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline first launched in 2005 as a ten-digit number. At the time, Kana was working for the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA, which oversaw the number’s rollout. Over the years, she watched the Lifeline evolve, expanding to include options for Spanish language, veterans’ crises, and disaster distress help lines. “I've been along for the journey of the growth of the Lifeline and saw advocacy from the field trying to advance a three-digit calling number,” she says. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. The new easy-to-remember number, while hugely promising, raises at least one potential challenge. Call volume—rising over the years—has already begun skyrocketing since the new number launched. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. To help localities and stakeholders across the country prepare for this surge, the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), the firm's non-profit-generating entity that focuses on addressing public health challenges, has been involved in a range of nationwide efforts. This includes helping ensure states, contact centers, first responders, and community behavioral health providers know exactly what they need to meet demand—be it new strategies, workforce training, data infrastructure upgrades, or other support. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Defining effective crisis care In December 2020, MHI came together with a group of national behavioral health and crisis-care stakeholders for a series of working sessions organized by Vibrant Emotional Health , the not-for-profit administrator of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; RI International , a global organization focused on the design and delivery of behavioral health crisis services; and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) . The goal was to help prepare for the launch of 988. MHI began by listening to 911 managers, mental health and substance-use treatment providers, contact center operators, and first responders to develop a consensus around the critical dimensions of crisis care. MHI gathered input from participating partners on what critical elements of community-based crisis care were necessary for the delivery of the 988 Lifeline. These conversations helped establish a shared understanding among stakeholders around the priorities of community-based crisis care: ensuring that anyone in crisis has someone to call, someone to help, and a safe place to go, as envisioned in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care . Simple as it sounds, this involves developing a continuum of care that includes the 988 crisis line staffed by local workers who can provide information, deescalate crises, and—when in-person support is needed—connect people with nearby services and relevant resources. Had this kind of response existed in 2019, Kana and her daughter would have had a place to go besides the ER; one that might have provided appropriate care and helped ease already constrained hospital capacity. About the McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating global entity within McKinsey. MHI strives to catalyze actions across continents, sectors, and communities to achieve material improvements in health, adding years to life and life to years. Core to this aspiration is improving brain health. Brain disorders take a significant toll on both life expectancy and quality of life. In particular, the urgent and rising rate of mental health, substance use, and suicidal crises globally calls for a transformation of access to mobile crisis response and community-based crisis services. Through its foundational collaboration-based approach, MHI brings together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health. The result is meaningful impact on initiatives like the rollout of 988 in the United States and similar multistakeholder partnerships on crisis care around the world. Measuring costs and savings involved What would it take to ensure such crises are handled by trained professionals—including clinicians, peers, and other provider types—across a coordinated continuum of care in every community? To help answer this question, MHI began working with RI International in 2021 to build the Crisis Resource Need Calculator , a web-based cost calculator that allows local leaders to see a projection of annual behavioral health crisis care costs by county or state. The calculator enables them to understand the cost of providing for every individual in need of local, in-person crisis care based on SAMHSA’s national guidelines. It also considers how many mobile crisis teams states and counties would need, and what resources that would involve to build out to scale. The Crisis Resource Need Calculator also highlights potential healthcare savings available by making this shift in resources. Overall, the calculator estimates that with fully resourced community-based crisis systems in place, the United States could save a total of $34 billion in annual behavioral health costs otherwise spent on ER visits and inpatient beds. Helping build an action plan In addition to care costs, MHI also attempted to better assess responder readiness for the transition to 988. To do this, from November 2021 to March 2022, MHI partnered with state, federal, and local entities to develop detailed operational assessment playbooks to help key audiences, including states, tribes and territories, crisis contact operators, 911 centers, and behavioral health providers with understanding how they can prepare for the change. “The McKinsey team has been the glue that helped put this all together,” says Brian Hepburn, executive director of NASMHPD, which partnered with SAMHSA to prepare for 988’s 2022 rollout. “The effectiveness of the work is dependent on what happens between meetings, and McKinsey filled those gaps with needed data.” In March 2022, the 988 playbooks were released at a gathering of federal, state, and local stakeholders from across the field. They have since been shared with organizations like the National Council of State Legislators and the National Governors Association to help inform the efforts to scale 988. They’ve also been distributed by partners including the National Emergency Number Association , the National Association for State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors , and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing . Each playbook is geared toward a specific crisis-response group, including 911 professionals, Lifeline network contact centers, mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers, states, territories, and tribes. The playbooks were designed to help state and local leaders understand whether they’re properly staffed, funded, and prepared for 988 response and how to get there. “These playbooks offer stakeholders a self-assessment of their own readiness and links to specific recommendations and tools,” says Brian. Ensuring equitable care One of the ongoing challenges these playbooks attempt to tackle is creating equitable crisis care across communities. Ensuring underserved communities have their unique needs taken into consideration is one of the biggest challenges facing the current system, says Shelby Rowe, director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center . Shelby, a citizen of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma who has personally experienced suicidal episodes, sits on the board of RI International and advocates for marginalized groups and tribal communities to get access to the full spectrum of crisis care.\n“If you’re a 15-year-old black trans girl, your experience asking for help in Brooklyn, New York is going to be very different from your experience asking for help in rural Oklahoma,” she says. Creating a more equitable system requires including diverse voices of those with lived experiences and addressing the underlying challenges and limitations facing specific communities. For example, tribal boundaries don’t always align to state lines, which keeps tribal communities from accessing crisis resource funding; the needs of vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ youth; the lack of access to crisis response in remote rural communities; the struggles people of color face when attempting to find medical or crisis help, and the list goes on. “We have an opportunity and an obligation to build a truly equitable crisis response system,” says Shelby. Creating a sustainable model Today, crisis response and stabilization services are primarily funded by federal, state, and local governments. Many crisis contact centers are transitioning from trained volunteer workforces to paid specialized staff. Yet an equitable, fully resourced continuum requires sustainable funding and commitment to meet diverse needs across communities. To support this, MHI and its collaborators, NASMHPD and SAMHSA, are working on several ongoing efforts. This includes examining healthcare claims to better understand how crisis services are paid for, developing a tool to forecast the number of healthcare workers a state or community needs for crisis care, and developing models and strategies to lessen the burden on the crisis workforce. The idea is that state and local governments, payers, and providers can use these resources to better support the current workforce, focus workforce development efforts, and plan for long-term financial sustainability. “The McKinsey team’s expertise in analytics helped identify some of the root-cause factors driving workforce shortages and what financing models can impact this journey along the crisis treatment system,” says SAMHSA’s John Palmieri. Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives. It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. All of these moving parts come together to steer a broader plan of action for crisis care in the United States. The five-year vision put forth by SAMHSA includes the goal of having 90 percent or more of all 988 calls answered in-state by the end of 2023, up from 71 percent in 2020 , and providing 80 percent or more of individuals in the United States with access to mobile crisis response and local services in the next two to five years. “What’s missing today is widespread, community-based approaches to managing suicidality, mental health crises, and substance use crises both for adults and kids,” says Kana. “Those are the services communities need and getting them actually costs much less and produces better outcomes.” Including for people like Reina. Since the initial frightening 2019 episode, Kana and her daughter had several others before the family found support through a local county-run organization offering in-home counseling and support to kids and families in need. Reina has since become an advocate for crisis support for teenagers and started a not for profit in her community to raise awareness for suicide prevention and youth mental health. “Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives,” says Kana. “It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. It’s going take a lot of cross-sector collaboration to transform our nation’s response to behavioral health crises, and MHI is a committed partner along the way.” Related Articles Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z Addressing employee burnout: Are you solving the right problem?

ECU Worldwide is one of the largest less-than-container-load shippers in the world, with 30 years of experience, servicing close to 2,400 trade routes across 180 countries and 40,000 port pairs across the globe. In December 2019, just before the start of the global pandemic, leadership from ECU Worldwide began working with McKinsey to chart a plan for an ambitious transformation – an 18-month program called “Voyager.” The program would lead ECU Worldwide to a complete organizational overhaul that put in place leadership co-ordination and new technology that offered a better experience for their global workforce and customers. As a result, ECU Worldwide saw sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries and an overall doubling of earnings from 2018 to 2021. And they achieved all of this during a period of unprecedented disruption in their industry. The challenge ECU Worldwide operates a 4,500-person team out of more than 300 offices across the world, including offices in India, the United States, and Europe. These locations have accelerated growth into new markets. But they have also brought new challenges to operational cohesion. Locations were run as independent units rather than as parts of an interconnected global business. Sales teams traditionally focused on order fulfillment and issue resolution, rather than customer pipeline building; and in more mature markets, like Europe and the United States, resource utilization wasn’t optimized. Some locations were operating beyond capacity while others were being underutilized. Founder and chairman Shashi Kiran Shetty knew ECU Worldwide needed a new growth strategy. “We believed the company could do far more in terms of market share,” says Shashi. “We needed a digital strategy that would make us future-ready and help build the company into a global leader in the logistics industry.” The solution As the pandemic began upending the global logistics industry, ECU Worldwide worked with McKinsey to focus their goals into a resilient, long-term growth strategy that built operational cohesion and created digital solutions to give them a competitive advantage. “ECU Worldwide wanted a strategy that would make them future-ready and better integrate their people and operations around the world,” says McKinsey associate partner Chandan Kansal . “We helped them think through what organizational changes and digital solutions could make this happen.” Partner Neelesh Mundra leads McKinsey’s logistics work in India and co-leads our manufacturing and supply-chain work in Asia. “More than 50 colleagues from our offices across the world, and experts from our capabilities like McKinsey Digital , Implementation , and People & Organizational Performance , helped bring the best of our firm to this transformation,” he says. After an intensive diagnostic sprint, McKinsey and ECU Worldwide developed Voyager, a transformation plan that featured four central pillars: improving sales efficiency, transforming operations using analytics, optimizing the customer journey, and creating a future-ready organization. How it was done McKinsey helped the company identify more than 15 geographies across three major markets – Europe, Asia, and North America – that comprised the majority of ECU Worldwide’s overall business. The company looked closely at how sales teams in these regions worked with their customers, defined growth milestones, and conducted customer analyses to pinpoint specific country challenges and potential. ECU Worldwide then began working to strengthen connectivity among their sales teams. McKinsey helped build a coordination center that tracks KPIs, shipment movements, and sales and pricing across geographies. Decisions in different parts of the world could now be made and communicated across the organization in real-time, rather than taking several days or weeks to coordinate as they traditionally had. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth After the first 18 months, the growth strategy had been systematically put in place. It featured two major components. Technology transformation How tech enablement sets ECU Worldwide apart A big enabler of ECU Worldwide’s transformation was creating and streamlining centralized technologies that helped track what was happening across priority markets. Prior to this streamlining, data was often reported in different formats across different offices and might take several months to aggregate and review. The company worked with McKinsey to build automated management dashboards that gathered data from each market into a centralized center. A newly revamped customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360 , used data science to create a customer-centric experience. By onboarding new products and vendors onto the platform, ECU360 created a digital ecosystem spanning users across more than 80 countries, the largest of its kind. A complete organizational redesign ECU Worldwide’s focus then shifted to performance management, which the company led out of a new dedicated transformation office. “The important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization and institutionalization of best practices,” says Sanchita Mohanty, vice president of transformation for ECU Worldwide. “We had a detailed talent-value assessment identifying the key recruits we wanted for the organization to achieve the aspiration that we had set for ourselves.” The very important aspect that we focused on was the health of the organization. The automated dashboards gave ECU Worldwide a framework for company-wide performance reviews. The company could now institute KPIs that were common across geographies and tied to the organization’s overall goals. With everyone looking at the same data, workers could see how they were a part of one global organization, working toward common objectives, rather than operating in silos. This impact was then sustained through a newly set up Data Science and Analytics Centre of Excellence. The impact The technology transformation created efficiencies across various areas of the business, improving ECU Worldwide’s resilience along with their visibility and control over cargo movements in the supply chain. The customer-facing digital sales dashboard, ECU360, brought more customer insights to ECU Worldwide, resulting in a 25 percent increase in adoption and 90 percent customer retention rate. A new sales app helped increase productivity for the client workforce with more than 60 percent of bookings now done on ECU360. A yield management tool tracked value leakages and demand spikes, enabling teams to revamp sales strategies. And a redesigned sales accelerator app helped increase productivity by 150 percent. Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership. They implemented the rigor needed to move the organization in the way it needed to move. “This transformation program, Voyager, institutionalized a new way of working within the organization,” says Adarsh Hegde, joint managing director for ECU Worldwide. “Today if you talk to anybody in our offices in China, Germany, or India, you will find the same language being spoken by them.” While forwarders globally saw earnings growth during the pandemic due to demand bottlenecks, ECU Worldwide’s sales program was distinct in that it focused on volume growth specifically, which had been stagnant for several years. By focusing on key markets, ECU Worldwide’s transformation covered 80 percent of overall sales, resulting in sales growth of between 20 to 40 percent across more than 20 countries as well as sales growth from newly integrated less-than-container-load and trucking services in the past two years. Operations processing time was also reduced by 30 percent thanks to a model office playbook developed and deployed across more than ten countries to streamline operations and set up an ECU Worldwide way of working. Getting this strategy right has enabled the company to start exploring its next bold moves in air freight and cross-border ecommerce. “Bringing focus and drive was a common goal we all aspired for. We’d grown through many acquisitions and needed a common ECU way of doing business,” says Tim Tudor, CEO of ECU Worldwide. “Having brought McKinsey in as a part of the transformation has been a real partnership.

In fact, given Scope 3 emissions in their supply chains, manufacturing, transport, and construction are the most emission-heavy sectors in the world. Danfoss is one organization working to change that. One of the largest producers of component parts for heating and cooling, drives, and power solutions, the Nordic company’s net-zero transformation is helping manufacturers around the world green their supply chains. Would you like to learn more about our Sustainability Practice ? The opportunity With more than 42,000 employees across the world, Danfoss produces thousands of components each year. Used across manufacturing industries, these components find their way into countless technologies essential to keeping everyday life moving for people the world over. The company, says CEO Kim Fausing, has an opportunity to make a powerful environmental impact. “We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification,” says Kim. “We want to be the best-in-class preferred partner for customers looking to decarbonize and are taking our own medicine—continuously making the way we run our business more energy efficient.” We’re at a critical juncture in addressing climate change. Everything Danfoss does is focused on increasing machine productivity, reducing emissions, lowering energy consumption, and enabling electrification. Kim and Jürgen Fischer, president of Danfoss Climate Solutions began having high-level discussions with McKinsey in the summer of 2021 about how best to engage customers -- makers of equipment across these emission-heavy sectors who use Danfoss’s component parts – to become their preferred partner in decarbonization. The question at the center of those conversations: What should Danfoss’s decarbonization target be and how could the company make a realistic plan to meet it? Setting a course for net zero Danfoss’s Climate Solutions business is responsible for producing heating and cooling machinery components. Teaming up with McKinsey sustainability experts, Danfoss looked for ways to decarbonize various aspects of it. They learned that while the highest carbon emissions come from the use of products across their entire lifecycle, the second largest source of emissions lies in the materials and construction processes. Product redesign and an alternative supply chain offered two possible ways forward. “Material decarbonization is the next frontier for advanced industries,” says McKinsey partner Jacob Staun. “We helped Danfoss map out the complexity of their supply chains to identify sources of emission and design solutions with a positive impact on cost and carbon.” Innovating with technology To facilitate and accelerate the process, Danfoss, with the help of McKinsey, developed a digital platform that assesses carbon emissions along the entire supply chain of each product. This tool, called Zero Carbon Product, from McKinsey’s Catalyst Zero solution, mapped the company’s bill of materials for each product against a library of around 600 decarbonization levers spanning 100 material categories. The result was a cost-optimized decarbonization roadmap showing, for example, alternative suppliers for certain materials like iron, steel, and aluminum, that could help Danfoss create low-carbon versions of existing products still at low cost. Partnering for success The next step in the process was to test the roadmap’s likelihood of success. Pilot journeys were created for five products from Danfoss’s Climate Solutions portfolio. An assessment of these initial five products found that for a minimal increase in costs, emissions from materials purchased to make each product could be reduced by as much as 95 percent. Here was a clear path to eliminating most emissions at low cost. The program pinpointed exactly where reductions could be made and how – an assessment that took hours rather than days with traditional methods – thereby creating an opportunity to scale the solution across Danfoss’s large product line. At the same time, McKinsey conducted customer interviews to better understand the price elasticity of low-carbon products. This would help Danfoss determine which suppliers to team up with to pilot some of these new sustainable product line solutions. Building capabilities The next question was one of scale. Danfoss’s entire portfolio comprises hundreds of product lines, each with anywhere from tens to hundreds of product variances. While Danfoss has around 5,000 suppliers, McKinsey’s analysis found that around half of total embodied emissions came from just 50 of those suppliers. This created a shortlist to focus on to have the greatest impact. Danfoss worked with McKinsey to build new capabilities, including embedding carbon assessments into product engineering and retraining employees to add decarbonization to their procurement strategy. “Building lower carbon products requires an entirely new way of working, one that requires new skill sets and embedding carbon reduction into every business process including procurement, product design, and go-to-market,” says McKinsey associate partner Jessica Fan. Decarbonizing at scale This has helped Danfoss achieve the goal of assessing its entire Climate Solutions product portfolio by the end of 2022 to create a clear product engineering roadmap moving forward. And it’s become part of a broader set of Science Based Targets : by 2030, Danfoss aims to reduce all direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy by 46.2 percent; reduce emissions across the value chain by 15 percent; and become carbon neutral across its operations. By the end of 2021 into early 2022, training personnel at Danfoss in how to move this decarbonization process forward became a priority. McKinsey deployed a train-the-trainer model, arming around 20 key Danfoss employees with the skills and tools needed to train employees across the organization to carry out this decarbonization mission. Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance. This train-the-trainer process involved identifying key people, making sure they were included in the initial five pilots, then conducting trainings and workshops so they could own the rollout of this new tool. The next step involved taking a closer look at the overall product launch strategy. While the company started with the Climate Solutions segment of its business, the goal is to complete this same process across its other two business units: Power Solutions, which makes up half of the overall business and Power Electronics and Drives, which accounts for another 30 percent. Danfoss is currently working with McKinsey in the proof-of-concept stage for its Power Electronics and Drives business as part of a two-and-a-half-year plan to roll out low carbon products across the entirety of the business. “Achieving carbon neutrality through energy efficiency and electrification is not a transition that happens overnight or by chance,” says Kim. “Danfoss is fully committed to both having a positive climate impact and also helping our customers become more climate-friendly through their use of our products and solutions.” Related Articles Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation An AI power play: Fueling the next wave of innovation in the energy sector How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "Danfoss, a major global components manufacturer, is implementing a carbon reduction roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions.

But there is opportunity here. Building new workforce capabilities can accelerate inclusive growth for national economies, increase socio-economic mobility among workers, and help organizations improve their financial and operational performance. Investing in upskilling and reskilling workers is urgent, yet the playbook for doing so is outdated and won’t meet the multiplying need. McKinsey’s recent reskilling capability-building work with a regional government department in Australia shows what’s possible—and what scale could look like. A global skills crisis A McKinsey Global Institute survey found that 87 percent of companies worldwide reported experiencing skill gaps now or are expecting to within the next five years, impacting productivity and competitiveness at corporate and national levels. Our analysis shows that Japan will need a 2.5 fold increase in productivity growth over the next decade to maintain its recent GDP-growth rate. And the Tech Council of Australia forecasts that its nation will fall 200,000 tech workers short of its 1.2 million target by 2030, with only 7 percent of the non-tech workforce having a strong skills match with tech occupations. Nearly all respondents to the McKinsey Global Institute survey identified closing skill gaps as a main concern, yet only one-third of respondents say their organizations are prepared to address potential role disruptions. Only 28 percent say their organizations make effective decisions on how to close skill gaps. Upskilling and reskilling today’s workforce—in non-degree, skill-building programs—is critical to attracting and retaining talent while driving market competitiveness. “Hiring alone will not meet future workforce demands,” says Rod Farmer, a McKinsey associate partner in Sydney and leader of customer experience and design work in Asia-Pacific for McKinsey Digital. “We’re rapidly moving from a job-based to a skills-based economy requiring more nimble, tech-savvy, and multi-disciplinary teams. We’re seeing significant skills gaps emerging across all sectors of the Australian labor market and broadly across Asia.” One organization that understands this is Australia’s Department of Regional New South Wales (DRNSW), a government department supporting regional communities through agriculture, local infrastructure projects, soil conservation, environmental stewardship, economic development, and more. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated DRNSW’s need for a future-ready workforce. With most employees based in remote areas, many observed an increased need for digital skills but had not received the necessary technological training prior to the pandemic. Increased reliance on digital and data skills became both a strain on the agency’s productivity and accelerated digital inclusivity challenges. Identifying needs, seeing new potential At the onset of the pandemic, DRNSW took stock of its employees’ digital capabilities. The department uncovered a range of digital literacy challenges, ranging from frontline workers relying on friends and colleagues for help with basic digital tasks, such as emails and timesheets, to more complex tasks involving spreadsheets, where increased skills mastery was now essential. We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting. “We had many employees who were finding ways around using technology because it turned out they didn’t have basic skills—even like joining a Zoom meeting,” says Donna Mcleod, acting chief people officer of DRNSW. “It was a shock. We had to figure out how to make a fundamental, baseline shift.” DRNSW had tried traditional learning approaches in the past, which fell short of shifting needs and operating models. It needed to move beyond employees learning on their own, separately from their work, which often leads to surface knowledge acquisition only. “We saw there was a major need here—an opportunity for innovation and new capability building models within DRNSW where we could support the people of New South Wales, while also tackling a larger national skills-gap challenge,” says Rod. Over the next 12 months, DRNSW and McKinsey built an enterprise Digital Skills Program, creating an entirely different reskilling engine at the heart of DRNSW. Reinventing skill building McKinsey and DRNSW began their journey by reframing the challenge. DRNSW took an applied skills development approach, focusing on the jobs-to-be-done. This shift meant an increased focus on employee-backed, context-dependent, and on-the-job skills development—solving real day-to-day people development and productivity needs. Core to the DRNSW approach was contextualized learning: the notion that skill development does not happen in a classroom but while employees are on the job, with direct apprenticeship where they are able to immediately operationalize it. Human-centered design resulted in a program informed by a deep study of the individual’s and organization’s needs and pain points, brought to life through ethnographic research across regional and rural New South Wales, addressed in small peer-based groups with individual coaching, and supported by short feedback cycles. “One of the universal pain points we observed was that it’s very difficult for people to make time for upskilling and reskilling beyond their day-to-day responsibilities,” says Donna. “It was important for us to develop a program that placed skill building at the core of their workday, supported by peers and mentors.” The new DRNSW Skills Program helps to identify the specific skills, competencies and proficiency levels required at an organizational level within DRNSW roles. The program then helps assess employee skills, develop tailored programs to close the gaps, and support individuals in their role through direct peer-led coaching. Furthermore, the program scales from shorter upskilling modules to larger reskilling programs to support lateral internal hiring. “We now measure skills readiness in months, not years,” says Rod, who led the DRNSW’s skills transformation. “This isn’t a yearly one-and-done type of problem. Organizations need to institute continuous reskilling and upskilling if they are to maintain future-ready workforces.” To achieve this skills transformation, McKinsey and DRNSW worked with Mentem by UNSW. A new, independent business launched and backed by the University of New South Wales, Mentem helps corporate businesses upskill and reskill their employees at scale through tailored on-the-job training. This collaboration also provided employees the potential to receive micro-credentialling through time spent learning on the job—enabling access to credentialled learning at a global top 50 higher-education institution. Building Mentem by UNSW, a reskilling business UNSW—like many top universities—recognized the opportunity to further extend its post-graduate services beyond its more traditional offerings. Importantly, it also recognized that this challenge required the university to develop new operating and service models that leveraged its unique assets and heritage in adult learning, whilst accelerating product innovation and industry collaboration. To help realise its ambitions, UNSW partnered with Leap by McKinsey (McKinsey’s venture building capability) who helped design, build and launch the new venture at pace. “We’d never have been able to independently build a blueprint for a business this fast—we did it in 12 weeks, which is unheard of at a university for something of this magnitude,” says Arvind. “Mentem exists to provide new educational models for employer and workforce needs in Australia and globally,” says Arvind Sampath, founding chief executive officer of Mentem. “Working with DRNSW was an exciting opportunity to leverage our knowledge and revitalize a government agency we all rely on.” Another core element of the DRNSW Digital Skills Program is the ‘skills hub,’ critical for engaging the broader DRNSW organization and ensuring sustained impact as the program scaled. This new operational unit consists of a DRNSW squad with capability building specialists, human-centered designers, instructional designers, and program delivery experts. To evaluate impact and prove the viability of scaling up the new program, Mentem developed a unique learning analytics platform that measured individual and cohort performance over time, leveraging learner management system analytics, project results, and coach feedback. The platform also provides automated interventions, or nudges, to individuals and coaches to drive program engagement and behavior change. Transformative results For DRNSW, the results exceeded expectations—and in record time—with over 90 percent employee satisfaction and 85 percent of participants reporting improved applied skills. The 8-week courses are now scaling across DRNSW. “Other agencies couldn’t believe we built, piloted and started scaling this entire new approach to capability building in six months when this can typically take two or three years in government,” Donna says. “It was a phenomenal delivery.” Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. These types of changes, scaled throughout the agency, increased productivity and delivered improved services for constituents. Gone are the days when some farmers would keep detailed logs in their pocket notebooks, then travel across the state simply to hand deliver the paper to colleagues who would provide some basic entry or email assistance. The program has already been recognized for its impact and employee-centric approach, winning the Best in Class award in the public-sector category from Good Design Australia, one of the most prestigious design awards in the world. But the biggest testament to its success is the difference it made in the careers of the employees. “You have to realize, this has absolutely changed people’s lives,“ says Donna. Participants reported very high levels of increased confidence in performing their work, value from their coaches and overall satisfaction with the program. “The program was very different from anything I’ve done before,” says Charlene, who completed the program. “The coaching was my highlight of the week.” “To do these jobs, the way everything’s going digital, you need to upskill to get there,” says Glenn, another participant. “I thought, ‘wow, this program is for me.’” The stakes for DRNSW were high—delivering government services that drive value for citizens is essential. But for corporate institutions, it could very much be a question of survival. “If a government agency like DRNSW can make such a major shift with a traditionally non-digital workforce, then enterprises can meet the moment too.” says Roland Dillon, a partner with McKinsey’s Public & Social Sector practice based in Melbourne. “Not doing so could lead to an existential crisis as competitors not only leapfrog the market, but do so while taking talent that is hungry to learn and develop in an increasingly digital world.” Related Articles Future of  Work Undaunted by global disruption, a logistics company embraces bold transformation How a manufacturing moonshot was made", "summary": "A government agency in Australia, DRNSW, is addressing the global skills crisis by implementing a Digital Skills Program in collaboration with McKinsey.

Many of them shop at Makro, a well-known Thai wholesaler, to meet that demand. The global pandemic has highlighted the essential role these wholesale suppliers play in society—and the opportunity they have, to accelerate their own digital transformations, build new e-commerce capabilities, and better serve customers. When leaders at CP AXTRA Public Company Limited decided to make a digital transformation, they partnered with McKinsey to identify the right strategy, lead with technology, and ensure their transformation would endure. The opportunity The first B2B online platform of its kind Makro was only capturing 10 percent of buyers’ share of wallet. Their customers typically went to other suppliers, from smaller vegetable producers to wet markets, to fulfill their commercial needs. “That adds a lot of operational overhead for them, causing a lack of efficiency in running their businesses,” says Tirayu Songvetkasem, chief digital officer of CP AXTRA. The advent of the pandemic accelerated these challenges and helped create momentum to solve for this customer need. We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working. “Makro comes from a very classic business background,” says Paul Howe, group chief information officer of CP AXTRA . “We knew there was disruption happening and we needed help to understand how to get disruption to flow through our business using new ways of working.” How it was done Building products, teams, and a trust-based relationship Leap by McKinsey experts partnered with CP AXTRA to build a new digital platform where business owners could access a real-time view of wholesale inventory from hundreds of suppliers in a single app. Known as Makro PRO, the platform offers streamlined goods-purchasing for hotels, restaurants, and cafes. “Building Makro PRO from scratch was a new experience for us. For the platform to be successful, we needed a very solid and future-ready technology stack and architecture,” says Yanawee Sarotnunjeen, a product owner at Makro PRO. “We worked with McKinsey to help us accelerate the technology build and make it secure and highly scalable. McKinsey brought in expert digital talent, including product builders and strategists, software engineers, data scientists and designers—and embedded them within our team. Today the technology that supports Makro PRO has been embedded into other parts of our organization.” As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth. After the initial build, CP AXTRA knew it had to build its own tech talent bench to sustain and scale the platform. “We worked with McKinsey to hire and build tech capabilities systematically across different roles and seniority levels,” says Yanawee. “In six months, we grew the Makro PRO team from 0 to 60 people.” Over the project, McKinsey helped CP AXTRA to embed upskilling and professional development into the fabric of the organization’s culture, building capabilities of more than 200 colleagues who are dedicated to Makro PRO, and updating compensation and benefits for the company. As Dymfke Kuijpers, a McKinsey senior partner who leads our retail work globally and our consumer work in Asia explains: “As impact partners, helping our clients upskill and hire talent is quintessential to their ability to sustain growth themselves. In the end, tech is never the bottleneck—a lack of people and capabilities are.” Uncovering pain points Building a minimum viable product from scratch “We were true partners across each and every part of the business build, working as one team,” says Tomas Laboutka, a McKinsey expert associate partner. “This kind of collaboration made it easy to share ideas, test and iterate quickly, and ultimately create a trust-based relationship that was critical as we worked remotely most of the time.” The impact Unlocking opportunities for employees, small farmers, and businesses alike Over the last two years, CP AXTRA has reskilled more than 200 employees to support its omni-channel business and Makro PRO platform, which now processes thousands of orders daily with tens of thousands of products available on the platform. Elsewhere, CP AXTRA expands the opportunity for sellers like small farmers to reach customers. “This impact is a result of a shared vision and excitement that we have with CP AXTRA for building a new business that can benefit many local businesses–the heartbeat of the Thai economy,” Tomas says. As Noppamas Sivakriskul, a McKinsey senior partner and the managing partner of our Thailand office, says: “This is a brand I’ve grown up with and loved. I’ve had the chance to partner with its leadership team for nearly a decade. This is an idea that we’ve been exploring for a few years.

While 40 to 45 percent of those chats usually get resolved by the current classic chatbot, that still leaves another 16,500 customers a week needing to speak with a live agent for help. This can leave customers with potentially longer waiting times as they’re only able to get live help for non-urgent requests during working hours. Generative AI’s ability to interact with human language in ways simply not possible before created an opportunity for teams from QuantumBlack, McKinsey's AI arm, and ING to explore how advanced chatbot technology could be used to improve the customer experience, giving customers the assistance they need immediately. This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry. From idea to impact The Solution Developing advanced chatbot capabilities A joint ING and McKinsey team worked closely together for seven weeks to build a generative AI chatbot that offered customers immediate tailored help while maintaining clear guardrails to mitigate risk. The team started with an in-depth analysis of the existing chatbot to identify specific challenges. The final solution consisted of a multi-step pipeline to generate the best answer for the customer including knowledge retrieval from available data stores and a ranking of potential answers by helpfulness. In the case when several helpful answers arose, the system would offer multiple options to the customer – a process called disambiguation. Lastly, before any answer was sent to the customer, a series of guardrails was applied. In order to do this, ING risk stakeholders were brought into this process from the very start and ING-specific guardrails (to avoid giving advice on mortgages and investment products, for example) were built using out-of-the-box tools from QuantumBlack Labs , our AI and machine learning innovation hub. The gen AI chatbot was released on testing days to 10 percent of real customers in the Netherlands who were using the support chat function on the mobile app. It offered a customer experience that was demonstrably superior to the classic chatbot, providing customers with much more detailed and tailored responses, and helping them resolve their queries faster. Since launching in September 2023, thousands of customers have interacted with the new gen AI chatbot, making it the first-of-its-kind real-life customer-facing pilot conducted in Europe. “By prioritizing real customer needs, security, and ease of use, ING was able to develop a bespoke customer support tool that gives users the best possible experience,” says ING chief operating officer Marnix van Stiphout. The Impact At the forefront of gen AI applications in banking When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers. “When done right, using gen AI can be incredibly powerful in creating a better customer experience while also prioritizing the security of banking customers,” says McKinsey senior partner and co-leader of the Global Banking and Securities Practice Stephanie Hauser . As part of a broader effort, ING focused on capability building across more than 50 support functions – in the Risk department, Contact Center department, and Analytics Office and Technology – giving ING a lighthouse case to more broadly scale their gen AI efforts. Working together, the ING and McKinsey team created a path to double performance of the chatbot in the next six months, build a scalable model that can be extended to all other ING countries, and setup a technical foundation for ING to address a wide set of gen AI use-cases across the Group. The efforts helped define a blueprint to scale across ten markets with the potential to impact more than 37 million customers across 40 countries. “This project has helped establish a solid technical foundation that puts ING at the forefront of gen AI applications within the banking industry,” says Bahadir Yilmaz, ING Chief Analytics Officer. “Gen AI technology will further evolve and we feel well-positioned to leverage those developments in order to offer the customer the best experience and remain a technology leader in our industry.” Lessons Learned Let’s connect Andrea Del Miglio Senior PartnerMilan Carlo Giovine PartnerLondon Stephanie Hauser Senior PartnerLondon Mohcine Ouass PartnerAmsterdam Niels Van der Wildt PartnerLondon Related Generative AI QuantumBlack Labs", "summary": "ING is using generative AI to enhance customer support, improving response times and tailoring assistance.

It oversees a vast network of passenger airlines and aviation service companies. 2023 ESG Report: Accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth for all Up until 2022, Lufthansa housed its data across 14 separate ERP applications. This meant that their spend management solution was able to provide an overview at a high level. The company recognized that if they could gain more transparency across these data sources, they would be able to identify actionable spend insights at more granular levels across the organization. Lufthansa wanted to track more accurately what they were sourcing and paying for; this would open a channel to strengthen their procurement strategies, help identify more savings, and better understand their carbon footprint. “Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems,” says Holger Koenig, enterprise architect for Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “We wanted to break down data silos, simplify the delivery of trusted data faster across all our systems, and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources.” In 2022, leaders began working with McKinsey on a SaaS solution. It would need to play well with their own implementation of SAP’s Business Technology Platform (BTP) and translate siloed data streams into a consolidated, global view of procurement spend. It was called Spendscape. The Solution A fully integrated SaaS software Spendscape provides a comprehensive understanding of procurement spending. McKinsey adapted it to integrate with SAP’s BTP to enable data and analytics-driven management and create holistic visibility across the supply chain. Our data landscape is vast, complex, and distributed across systems. We wanted to break down data silos... and provide a single harmonized point of access to all our data sources. “Sophisticated organizations require superior data and insights for decision making. Procurement has gotten significantly more complex with carbon emission targets, managing supply risk, and inflation and deflation factors coming into play,” says McKinsey partner Björn-Uwe Mercker . “We now have a lot of volatility in the market, which drives the need for a super-fast reaction time. To do this, you need a data model and analytics that can keep up.” Fully integrating the Spendscape SaaS software onto SAP’s platform would create a 360-degree view of Lufthansa’s procurement performance. First implemented at Lufthansa Technik, a business focused on maintenance and repair of aircraft, and now being rolled out across the group, the tool is creating greater spend transparency across sourcing systems, simplifying data integration processes, and informing supplier negotiations to help reduce costs. For example, future purchasing decisions could be made using not just a full picture of external costs and spending across the value chain but also with the added layers of near-real-time data on price volatility and carbon emissions -- leading to smarter decision making and procurement across the board. Once fully realized across the group, the successful implementation of this tool could have far-reaching implications. It will provide better metrics across operations, including risk analytics, supplier negotiation, working capital, monitoring of material cost and procurement performance, among other areas. “With Spendscape, we aspire to build one comprehensive spend analytics platform for Lufthansa, fully embedding it into our IT architecture strategy,” says Lennart May, senior director procurement, Lufthansa Group. “This will deliver actionable insights and be integrated with future systems.” This reduces the number of tech components they need to use on the backend and allows for a solution that’s fast and scalable for future systems. The Impact Optimizing cost and carbon reduction decisions Spendscape has already uncovered actionable spend insights for Lufthansa Technik, where it was first deployed. It has also made it easier to collaborate across business units and provided a tool for data model changes and near-real time cash position management. The impact goes beyond financial and operational improvements. With the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive taking effect at the start of 2024, Lufthansa also needs to strengthen and prioritize capabilities and transparency around upstream Scope 3 emissions reporting. Spendscape unites procurement data from more than ten ERP systems into a single taxonomy. The result is a searchable source of truth combining information on carbon footprint across categories, down to the consumption and invoice level. This made it possible for Lufthansa to create comprehensive Scope 3 emissions transparency and collaborate more effectively with suppliers to improve reporting accuracy and optimize decisions for both carbon reduction and cost savings. “This is one of the more sophisticated use cases that goes well beyond classic spend reporting ,” says Björn. “Spendscape’s ability to create more transparency around Scope 3 emissions shows just how powerful a sophisticated data landscape can be in transforming the way businesses are run.” Related case studies McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation Building a next-generation carbon platform to accelerate the path to net zero Let’s connect Björn-Uwe Mercker PartnerMunich", "summary": "Lufthansa is leveraging Spendscape, a SaaS solution integrated with SAP's platform, to unify spend data from multiple ERP systems.

A growing number of companies with long-term carbon reduction strategies are turning to carbon credits to hold themselves accountable for their more immediate carbon footprint. As a result, demand is expected to increase 15-fold by 2030 and 100-fold by 2050, according to the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets , a private-sector-led initiative informed by McKinsey knowledge and advisory support. Within the next decade, the overall market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth upwards of $50 billion. And yet, the process for identifying, vetting, buying, and managing carbon credits around the world has proven labor-intensive and hard to scale for many companies. It often requires them to conduct their own due diligence for each project they consider funding. This nascent market includes an evolving and often subjective definition of quality, varying degrees of carbon removal permanence, lack of price transparency, and uncalculated risk. Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants. In the face of such growing demand and complexity, the private equity firm and global alternative asset manager TPG saw the need for a more sophisticated approach to accessing carbon markets. Leadership at TPG Rise Climate, TPG’s dedicated climate-focused private equity fund, saw an opportunity to leverage the tools of more mature markets—diversification, active management, and risk management—to address barriers to scaling efficient voluntary carbon markets. They partnered with McKinsey to build a new platform that would fill critical gaps in the market. What’s behind a Rubicon Carbon Tonne? Rubicon Carbon creates diversified portfolios of high-quality carbon credits called Rubicon Carbon Tonnes or RCTs. These portfolios are offered as curated baskets of credits or can be customized to fit a company's net-zero plan. The RCT is designed to reduce risks and increase options for climate-ambitious corporate buyers. Rubicon Carbon offers three curated RCT portfolios: nature-based emissions avoidance and reductions, industrial emissions reductions, and carbon removal. The RCT uses the tools, logic, and lessons of finance to enable companies to invest safely in carbon credits. “Rubicon Carbon constructs and oversees collections of high-quality carbon credits that have gone through a professional vetting process and are monitored on an ongoing basis,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane. “Their model essentially provides carbon credits as a service, allowing their customers to seamlessly access market-leading capabilities and tools.” “Voluntary carbon markets can be a powerful tool to allocate capital from those with a high cost of carbon to high-impact projects with a lower cost of carbon. But these nascent markets were opaque and difficult to navigate for many participants,” says McKinsey partner Sean Kane . “TPG and McKinsey asked: How can we partner to build the next generation carbon platform and do it fast enough to create a market leader in a rapidly evolving space?” McKinsey worked with TPG to create Rubicon Carbon , an easy-to-use, transparent, enterprise-grade digital platform that offers innovative, high-quality corporate carbon products at scale in order to accelerate global sustainability and carbon removal. From idea to impact The Solution An innovative risk-adjusted carbon credit portfolio Over the course of less than 12 months, we worked alongside TPG to build and launch the Rubicon Carbon platform, applying a real capital markets approach to innovation in carbon markets. This included market research and segmentation, developing the business and product concept, using Leap business building strategies , business planning and execution, and helping secure sponsor launch funding. The work centered on establishing Rubicon Carbon as an enterprise-grade partner that brings sophisticated capabilities to corporate customers so that they don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every carbon credit transaction. Priorities to get there included coming up with a science-based approach to identifying high-quality credits, vetting the numerous attributes that drive quality and value to customers, and navigating the shifting landscape of risks in the market by actively managing baskets of credits over their life cycle. “Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time,” says Rubicon Carbon chief science officer Dr. Jennifer Jenkins. “By including a diversified portfolio of carbon projects, applying rigorous quality guardrails, and conducting ongoing monitoring and risk adjustments, we’re able to lower the risk assumed by buyers.” Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here. Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors. Over the course of six months, our team helped co-create a tech infrastructure and platform that integrated transaction management, carbon credit custody, customer portfolio management, and full enterprise technology architecture. The work included corporate onboarding and accounted for the necessary compliance features along with bespoke carbon credit purchasing and inventory management. “Moving from projects to products and portfolios is a unique innovation here,” says McKinsey associate partner Charles Riesenberg. “Previously, buyers in the market had to find and diligence individual carbon credit projects in different parts of the world, which creates an incredibly complex market.  Rubicon follows innovation from the financial markets where professional managers develop and manage high-quality portfolios for investors.” The Impact Connecting companies to meaningful climate projects TPG and Rubicon Carbon accelerated the platform’s time to market and customer acquisition over the course of six months. In addition to overseeing the asset management platform build, McKinsey helped refine the product and offering strategy, designed initial product portfolios, and helped design the new company’s org structure. What began as 25 full-time employees, two MVP products, and a coalition of 15 corporate launch partners (including McKinsey), has now grown to become a market leader in next-generation carbon solutions including four distinct product offerings and a $1 billion capital mobilization goal. Rubicon Carbon has created a reliable way for companies with long-term carbon reduction goals to make a more immediate impact in offsetting their emissions. Carbon credits are exposed to different risks that can make their environmental benefits challenging to estimate, especially over time. It's already making a difference around the world. For example, through one project alone, 150,000 hectares have been preserved in Borneo. Elsewhere, methane emissions are being cut in Bangladesh, and 5,000 acres in Africa are being reforested to expand the habitat for endangered gorillas. \"It’s clear that companies must reduce emissions within their value chain, but to balance remaining emissions that can't be eliminated right now, we also need to scale high-quality carbon credits,” says Rubicon Carbon CEO Thomas Montag. \"Rubicon Carbon helps direct corporate funds toward meaningful climate projects in need of capital and moves us closer to reaching the ambitious net zero goals our planet needs.\" Let’s Connect Sean Kane Charles Riesenberg Related case studies From farm to tablet: Building a new business to solve an old challenge Made in Africa: Catalyzing stronger, sustainable, and inclusive economies How a global components manufacturer built an ambitious carbon reduction roadmap", "summary": "Rubicon Carbon, developed by TPG and McKinsey, aims to simplify access to carbon credits through a transparent digital platform.

While retail spaces must comply with ADA codes, once elements like moveable furniture and merchandise are added, accessibility can become limited. Starbucks is hoping to set an elevated standard of accessibility by going beyond ADA requirements to create spaces that make everyone feel welcome. With 16,000 stores in the U.S., the coffee giant knew it had a big opportunity to catalyze change for this large and diverse population. Starbucks wanted to make accessible design the rule rather than the exception for its customers and employees. “Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody,” says Katie Young, Starbucks SVP of Store Operations. “We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores.” Designing for people with disabilities is just good design for everybody. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of choice and independence for everyone at our stores. In 2021, Starbucks began working with McKinsey to develop elements of inclusive store design to reduce friction for those with disabilities and support independence for all in any built retail environment. The work included understanding potential points of exclusion and creating guidelines – what Starbucks now calls the Inclusive Spaces Framework – to make spaces more accessible for persons with disabilities. “The entirety of this work was not just about building something that’s just specific to Starbucks,” says McKinsey partner Anne Kronschnabl. “They wanted to develop guidelines to help change the retail industry at large. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it.” The Solution Minimizing points of exclusion McKinsey worked with Starbucks to identify barriers that may exist for people with disabilities throughout the customer journey. Heatmaps showed pain points around entering the store, ordering, and navigating spaces like the drive-thru and restrooms. Then the team worked on ideating potential solutions to eliminate or minimize points of exclusion throughout those spaces. We wanted something that was specific enough so that Starbucks could implement it in new store design, and broad enough for other retailers to be able to use it. One critical element of the approach was that persons with lived experiences were an integral part of the team, participating in every step of the work. “We were very intentional about who we had on our working team and made sure we had people representing different disability types involved in ideation and prioritization,” says Anne. “We made sure to have lots of involvement from individuals with lived experiences.” This led to a set of proposed changes such as wider spaces to allow easier access for wheelchair users, better signage in critical locations and at varying heights, and a variety of sound and lighting zones to accommodate varying sensory needs. Starbucks also wanted to focus on the employee experience. We looked at the employee journey and redesigned employee spaces with accessibility as a priority. More inclusive equipment was introduced, including a new drip brewer designed with a larger dial and visual and haptic feedback. The Impact A new set of accessibility guidelines In February of 2024, Starbucks opened its first retail space designed using this inclusive spaces framework in Washington, DC. It now plans to scale the design efforts across more stores. It’s a significant commitment. This year Starbucks plans to grow its U.S. footprint by around 4 percent, with plans to open around 600 new stores in addition to the existing 16,000 stores across the U.S. Growth plans will include the use of these new accessibility guidelines so that all newly built and renovated Starbucks company-operated stores in the U.S. will incorporate these more inclusive design elements. The retailer is also thinking beyond its own walls. Starbucks plans to share this inclusive design framework with other retailers and is standing up an Inclusive Spaces Coalition. The hope is that more retailers across the U.S. and beyond will use these learnings to make their built environments as inclusive as possible for customers and employees. “This framework defines how Starbucks will help expand independence, choice, and ease for all people across physical and digital spaces,\" says Starbucks CEO, and McKinsey alum, Laxman Narasimhan in a LinkedIn post . \"Developed alongside a diverse community of customers, partners, and accessibility experts, the framework will be open-source to help expand accessibility across the entire retail industry.\" Our People Anne Kronschnabl Becca Coggins Related case studies 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Protecting workers through award-winning design", "summary": "Starbucks aims to enhance store accessibility beyond ADA requirements by collaborating with McKinsey to create an Inclusive Spaces Framework.

This week, nonprofit Opportunity@Work and the Ad Council have launched a nationwide campaign to ‘ Tear the Paper Ceiling ’ and encourage employers to change hiring practices. McKinsey is providing pro bono support to the effort through data and analytics tools that enable recruiters to recognize STARs and their skills. “While companies scramble to find talent amid a perceived skills gap, many of their job postings have needlessly excluded half of the workers in the country who have the skills for higher-wage work,” says Byron Auguste , founder of Opportunity@Work and a former senior partner at McKinsey. “Companies like the ones we're proud to call partners in this effort—and those we hope will join—can lead the way by tapping into skilled talent from a far wider range of backgrounds.” McKinsey has driven extensive research on skills-based hiring and human capital , and built data-driven solutions that help employers implement new ways of screening for knowledge, skills, and capacity to learn. “A few years ago, we looked at many talent solutions in the market. There was a real risk of hard-wiring outdated notions of being a skilled worker,” says McKinsey partner Carolyn Pierce , who leads the technology team in the People and Organizational Performance practice . “Those systems gave little credit even to our own team members for skills learned on the job.” People & Organizational Performance: Equipping people and organizations to unleash sustained performance Carolyn and her team began collaborating with Opportunity@Work to prove the value and transferability of skills developed through work experience. “The Opportunity@Work team has done some incredible research that makes the business case for hiring STARs into today’s most in-demand jobs” says Carolyn. Our pro bono support will help make those insights more widely available to employers. “We increasingly hear from employers that they want to recruit from the STARs talent pool,” says Shad Ahmed, COO of Opportunity@Work. “But they need practical, data-driven tools to replace degree screens and hire STARs. The portal we are building with support from McKinsey will help employers identify which jobs should be open to STARs and help them source from this valuable talent pool. It’s a key part of our mission to create vital technology infrastructure wired for inclusion.” McKinsey is committed to tearing the ‘paper ceiling’ in our own hiring practices. “We have made significant investments to ensure that our own talent culture is both distinctive and inclusive, attracting and developing talent from a wide range of backgrounds,” says Katy George , senior partner and CHRO of McKinsey. “We are investing in more ways to recruit, hire, and grow STARs through a holistic approach that recognizes candidates’ skills and experience, problem-solving ability and intrinsic capabilities.” McKinsey’s technology organization is at the forefront of this effort, with many entry-level roles already open to STARs who have the necessary knowledge and skills. “We already have technologists at the firm—from entry-level through partner—who are STARs,” says Katy. “Our technology teams work on important and challenging problems, from helping organizations reduce their carbon footprint to improving worker safety. Our best path to solving these problems is to attract talented people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Our recruiting teams are actively working to make more STARs aware of these opportunities and encourage them to apply.” Creating more opportunities for STARs requires more than simply removing degree requirements from job descriptions. “We are scaling support for apprenticeships, bootcamps, and training programs to accelerate pathways for STARs into our firm” adds Katy. “The programs will help STAR talent build any additional skills needed for success at McKinsey and beyond.” There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential. We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up. Byron is hopeful that having McKinsey as a sponsor of this campaign will encourage more employers to change their talent practices. “A lot of organizations know that McKinsey is very data driven. It’s a strong signal that they are helping to build better ways to screen for talent and creating opportunities for STARs through their own hiring,” he says. Challenging the misconceptions associated with not having a college degree is key to helping more people tear through the paper ceiling. “Screening for a degree is one way to find people with skills and the capacity to learn—the problem is that you’re also screening for who had the right social and economic conditions in place to attend college,” says Carolyn. “There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential,” Carolyn adds. “We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up.” related No such thing as a dead-end job, new McKinsey research finds Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey supports the 'Tear the Paper Ceiling' campaign aimed at increasing upward mobility for over 70 million skilled workers in the US.

Scaling supply chains and infrastructure, developing analytics tools to assess climate risk, reskilling workers in highly carbon-dependent markets, and more will have a massive impact on our ability to stabilize global temperatures in line with the 1.5C-degree pathway. To help our clients reach their sustainability and broader ESG goals, we have launched Sustainability Academy , a capability-building program that helps organizations better equip their talent for the net zero transition. “Making our economic system more sustainable and more inclusive is an imperative that is felt by all types of stakeholders, from governments and regulators, to clients, suppliers, and end consumers,” says partner Pietro Sorrentino , who helps lead Sustainability Academy. “Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that: help companies accelerate change by supporting them in building new knowledge for their employees.” The program was designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy —our capability building center of excellence—and follows a simple approach: acquire, apply, and sustain. First, Sustainability Academy offers formal learning experiences to help talent acquire new knowledge and skills through practice and feedback. Second, teams apply these mindsets and capabilities in a real-world context, where impact materializes. Finally, we help organizations sustain new practices and habits to unlock lasting behavioral change. Sustainability Academy has launched with two foundational programs. Our Executive Masterclass kickstarts transformations by aligning senior executives with the mindsets and skills required to deliver their sustainability agendas. Sustainability Transformation Essentials, meanwhile, helps clients develop enterprise-wide awareness of core sustainability concepts, including the climate transition, solving the net-zero equation, and capturing new business opportunities. The program is already driving impact with clients. Recently, we partnered with a Fortune 500 company to accelerate their net-zero journey, helping them become an industry ESG leader. In this case, the client had articulated clear sustainability targets—including reaching net zero for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. But leaders needed to equip their teams with the practical skill sets needed to engage both internally and externally with stakeholders and suppliers. This is a common challenge: industry benchmarks show that in some sectors, nearly 100 percent of companies have defined and communicated sustainability strategies, but only 40 percent believe they have sufficient internal knowledge and capabilities to achieve their targets. Given that about 90 percent of our client’s emissions fell into Scope 3 (within the supply chain and not directly owned by the organization), equipping their talent with capabilities to engage their suppliers was particularly important. Sustainability Academy The company asked McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy to help their talent build the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they needed to engage with their suppliers to reduce emissions across the value chain. Together, we co-developed a multimodal journey—integrating fieldwork, digital learning, and live workshops—to help the client’s category managers prepare for conversations with suppliers. This journey looked at key emissions categories, such as distribution and logistics, identifying the sustainability opportunities to discuss with suppliers and internal stakeholders. It also provided modules on how to best lead the supplier discussions and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The same client also sought to increase spend with diverse companies by more than $1 billion across their tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We partnered with the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion team to create robust diversity programs and track against diversity targets. These efforts culminated in a virtual supplier summit with more than 200 suppliers and more than 1,000 internal and external attendees. Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that... These efforts delivered significant impact on both the sustainability and inclusion fronts. Supplier commitments to science-based targets increased by more than 50 percent from the baseline, and gains were made on supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion, with additional commitments on tier 2 reporting and identification of new business opportunities with tier 1 diverse suppliers. “Completing the online training modules, supported by the virtual forum sessions and open office hours, helped our client’s people build a fact-base for working with their suppliers, which enabled them to have productive conversations at the supplier summit,” says partner Maria Fernandez . “Today, this work is the foundation upon which their multi-year ESG transformation resides.” If your organization is interested in working with Sustainability Academy, please email us . related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story", "summary": "McKinsey's Sustainability Academy aims to upskill workers for the net-zero transition by providing capability-building programs.

With the evisceration of manufacturing jobs, it needed a major transformation. In 2011, the state had a novel idea. Using profits from the beverage industry, Ohio formed a new entity—a first-of-its-kind, state-authorized non-profit—to stimulate economic growth through new industries: JobsOhio . Over the next decade, the state saw nearly one million jobs created or protected. McKinsey was a key early partner, helping develop JobsOhio’s growth plan that identified ten sectors with opportunities for employment, such as aerospace and aviation, healthcare, logistics and distribution, technology, and financial services. In 2010, Ohio ranked 49th for job growth rate in these ten sectors. By 2022, they ranked 20th in job growth rate and had added $13 billion in payroll. The state’s job creation was its best ever, but JobsOhio wanted to ensure its strategy would be effective going forward. In 2018, the initiative asked McKinsey to issue a report evaluating its performance. “JobsOhio was in a class by itself in terms of economic development organizations as far as dollars per job, attracting companies, capital investments, and more,” says Ben Safran , a partner at McKinsey who worked on the report. “But we also found it needed to address approaching headwinds in the broader macro economy.” Brendan Buescher , a McKinsey senior partner based in Cleveland, says the findings encouraged JobsOhio to think locally. “They were certainly performing well against comparable organizations,” says Brendan, “but we urged them to measure success against the needs of Ohioans.” The case for inclusive growth The report helped shape JobsOhio’s 2.0 strategy, which expanded its industry-focus to include a new emphasis on workforce, innovation, infrastructure and investment throughout the state. From this, JobsOhio developed Innovation Districts in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—, multi-organization partnerships plan to create 60,000 jobs and establishing Ohio as a global leader in healthcare, life sciences, and technology in these three regions. As the new strategy was getting off the ground, COVID-19 rocked the state’s economy. Partnering with McKinsey again, JobsOhio quickly created a strategy for the pandemic economy, leading to the launch of Ohio to Work . Designed for displaced workers, Ohio to Work offered skills assessments, career coaching, virtual career fairs, and connection with employers who had signed on to interview or hire workers from the program. Specifically, McKinsey helped JobsOhio develop a unique program for reskilling and upskilling for higher-tech jobs: JobsOhio paid for tuition costs for technical degrees, and enrollees gradually repaid JobsOhio through a marginal percentage of their income—if they got a job that paid a good wage. Those repaid funds are not kept by JobsOhio; instead, the organization invests them in the next cohort. The program has been a success. Its funds have continued to replenish because of the high employment rate of participants. “With this strategy, not only is Ohio coming back strong from COVID-19, but Ohioans have the opportunity to pursue new careers they might have never thought possible,” says Ben. “A woman who had been a back-office worker and lost her job is now a nurse assistant—a whole new, stable career that feels like a calling. There are many powerful stories like this.” As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years. Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Most recently, the decade of growth and economic investment in Ohio helped attract a new investment from Intel, which announced earlier this year that it would be opening a new chip manufacturing plant in Central Ohio . This huge project is the largest single private-sector company investment in the state. It will create 3,000 new jobs at the plant with an average salary of $135,000. “As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years,” says JP Nauseef , president & CEO of JobsOhio. “Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The turnaround of the state’s jobs growth, Ben adds, suggests a potential way forward for other challenging situations. “Their success has been a paradigm shift,” says Ben Safran. “They are a model for growth in a changing economy.” related Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story", "summary": "JobsOhio, formed in 2011, revitalized Ohio's economy post-Great Recession by creating nearly one million jobs through a focus on new industries.

They had come to learn what would happen when they cranked the big mill up to a work rate that had never been tried. The possibility of causing problems at the mill weighed on everyone’s mind. The team members had initially resisted the idea of running the mill faster. They wanted to keep the stockpile of ore that feeds the mill from dropping below the minimum size they had long maintained. Their concern was that a too-small stockpile would hamper the mill’s performance. Whether the minimum stockpile size actually helped the mill run better was another matter. No one really knew for sure. Nor could the mill’s managers and staff say what would happen if the stockpile shrank to less than the traditional minimum. As the weeks went by, the copper-ore concentrating mill sustained a faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. What they did know is that a custom-built artificial-intelligence (AI) model, loaded with three years’ worth of operating data from the mill and programmed to look for operational tweaks that would boost output, kept saying copper production would rise if the mill were fed with more ore per minute. To the mill operators, that notion sounded logical enough—except that it didn’t account for the minimum stockpile size they had in mind. But the model didn’t know, or care, about minimum stockpile size or any of the mill operators’ other ideas about how the mill ought to be run. With permission from company executives, the crew members at the Bagdad site decided to turn up the pace of the mill as the model had suggested. They also prepared to ramp up mining and crushing activities so the stockpile of ore wouldn’t run out. At ten o’clock in the morning, a technician clicked a control on his computer screen to speed up the system of conveyor belts carrying chunks of ore from the crusher to the stockpile and from the stockpile to the mill. Everyone in the room kept watch on the 13 oversize monitors in the control room, which were lit up with readings from hundreds of performance sensors placed around the mill. The quantity of ore grinding through the mill rose. No warnings went up. Twelve hours passed. The mill held steady. Even when its stockpile of ore dipped below the usual minimum, the accelerated delivery of ore from the crusher and the mine allowed the mill to keep going. As the weeks went by, the mill sustained the faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill could handle more ore than its operators thought. “That was the breakthrough we’d been looking for,” Justin Cross, the Bagdad site’s general manager, told us. “Once we started to run the mill at full speed, we knew we could get results from more of the recommendations that the model was making.” The ‘age of the operator’ The story of how Freeport-McMoRan learned to rely on an AI model as much as the intuition of veteran mining engineers and metallurgists might not raise eyebrows outside the tech industry. For mining companies, though, it illustrates a quiet but profound shift into an era we think of as the “age of the operator,” when the best-run businesses wring profits out of low-grade ore that miners would have waved off as waste just ten years ago. One mine where Freeport-McMoRan had been processing declining ore grades is Bagdad, a sprawling Arizona complex where prospectors staked their first claims in 1882. Bagdad’s reserves of higher-grade ore have been depleted for some time, but Freeport-McMoRan has sustained the mine’s production of copper by making various process improvements. By the end of 2017, executives believed that Bagdad had gotten as efficient as it could get with its existing equipment, so they reasoned that adding capacity would be the surest way to get even more copper out of the site. Early in 2018, they started planning a $200 million capital expansion of Bagdad’s ore-concentrating mill that would lift production by 20 percent. Copper prices were high at the time. The investment looked certain to pay off. Then copper prices dropped from a five-year peak of around $3.30 per pound in early June to $2.75 or so a month later. All of a sudden, investing $200 million to expand Bagdad no longer seemed practical. Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase the site’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Instead, Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase Bagdad’s copper output without a massive injection of capital. Discovering improvements at an efficient mine wouldn’t be easy. But Freeport-McMoRan had plenty of high-quality information to study. Around ten years before, Bert Odinet, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief information officer, coordinated an effort to standardize the way that each site measures and reports its performance and to build a central data warehouse for storing those measurements. Several years later, maintenance teams lobbied for the installation of additional network equipment and performance sensors on the company’s trucks, power shovels, and stationary machines. The teams would manually download data from those sensors to the data warehouse so they could further sharpen their maintenance practices and improve the functioning of equipment. When wireless mesh networks became cost effective and reliable, Freeport-McMoRan installed them at all its sites. Now the company could capture and correlate second-by-second performance readings in the data warehouse, all in real time. “We learned things we’d have never predicted,” Odinet said. “That project taught us to be more receptive to what the data was telling us. And it gave us the confidence to try more complicated analyses.” With advanced analytics and AI techniques , Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of data it collected, identify even more operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in the field. Bagdad looked like a good proving ground for this method. The site is staffed with creative, open-minded engineers, metallurgists, and equipment operators who stood out at Freeport-McMoRan for their willingness to try new things. Their earlier efforts to enhance Bagdad’s metallurgical processes, for example, had resulted in higher copper recovery. And Cross, Bagdad’s general manager, was a natural tinkerer who liked to spend his free time outfitting his pickup truck for off-road use and milling mesquite logs into lumber for a house he planned to build himself. Since joining Freeport-McMoRan in 2006, Cross had led a series of projects to streamline operations at the company’s mines. Would you like to learn more about McKinsey Analytics ? It also helped that Bagdad’s operations were stable. With few equipment problems or process hiccups to straighten out, workers would have time to help increase copper production. Executives felt that promising opportunities to boost Bagdad’s production could be found in one part of the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, a noisy facility where huge milling machines and flotation cells bubbling with chemical solutions turn grapefruit-size rocks containing around 0.4 percent copper into a fine-ground mix of 25 percent copper and 75 percent rock. The mill’s technicians ran the facility strictly by the book, a set of operating instructions that Freeport-McMoRan engineers in Phoenix had developed. There had to be ways of building on those instructions that would better the mill’s performance. After talking things over with engineers and operations specialists from Bagdad and from headquarters, Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson and CFO Kathleen Quirk decided to let the crew at Bagdad work with McKinsey on a new kind of mining project: data mining in an agile way. Learning agile The project called for more than sophisticated data science. It also called for a new approach to solving tricky operational problems. “Usually when we run operational projects, we overengineer them. We test every conceivable scenario, build in safeguards, and do everything we can to ensure that a process change will result in an improvement before we make it,” Cross observed. “It’s a dependable way to get good results. But it takes a huge amount of time, effort, and capital investment.” McKinsey’s consultants reckoned that the crew at Bagdad might get better results, more quickly, by carrying out the analytics project differently. They introduced the idea of working under agile principles , which emphasize quick development of functional solutions that teams then improve, little by little, according to feedback from users. The general manager assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. Another essential feature of agile methods is face-to-face collaboration within well-rounded teams . Cross assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group. The composition of the team allowed it to tap the expertise and account for the interests of each division of Bagdad that its work might affect. It also enabled the team to contend better with challenges that involved different divisions and couldn’t be solved by one division alone. The team’s agile approach was to work in “sprints”—two-week bouts of activity in which the team conceived a data-modeling function or operational change, tested it, and learned what would make it better. As improvements came to light, the team would add them to a backlog. Then it would plow through the items on the backlog in subsequent sprints, starting with the easiest, most beneficial tasks. For Bagdad’s crew members, this agile style of working wasn’t just different from business as usual. It represented a radical departure from the way they’d been doing things. “It took us a while to get comfortable with agile,” Cross said. “We had to let go of a lot of old habits.” McKinsey brought in agile coaches to help. The coaches explained the rudiments of agile —building a backlog, deciding what to accomplish in each sprint, holding morning meetings to agree on the work the crew would perform each day and to note any difficulties that might slow it down—but were mainly there\nto join the team’s activities and teach its members to work together in agile ways. Shannon Lijek, a McKinsey partner who specializes in helping organizations apply agile methods, was one of the coaches who came to help the Bagdad team get the hang of agile. “We’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” said McKinsey partner Shannon Lijek. “Agile can be tricky to adopt at first because it isn’t a process you can memorize. It’s a set of principles for minimizing wasted effort and getting more work done. And we’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump right in,” Lijek said. One way that Bagdad’s agile team cut out needless effort was by introducing solutions as soon as it had built “minimum viable products,” or MVPs, that were good enough to use, rather than laboring to perfect those products first. “If we’d built the model ourselves, we’d have tried to get it 100 percent right before doing anything with it,” Cross told us. “Shannon and the McKinsey coaches encouraged us to work with solutions that weren’t finished. They’d say, ‘You can get 60 percent of the improvement with an MVP, and that’s a lot. So just start using it. Then you can worry about making it better.’” Introducing AI and agile to mining operations: Lessons from Bagdad By Red Conger Freeport-McMoRan’s effort to increase copper production at Bagdad taught us a good deal about how to use agile methods and AI tools at our sites, where it can be difficult to alter accepted routines. Here are a few things we’re keeping in mind as we expand the use of agile and AI to more of Freeport-McMoRan’s operations: Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan. From predicting to optimizing Once the team Cross formed came together, it began investigating the possibility of improving the mill’s performance. The idea was to spend a month examining data from the mill for patterns that revealed potential improvements. If those improvements looked promising enough, the team would pursue them. Beginning in late June, the Bagdad team and data scientists from McKinsey built a machine-learning model to check whether the mill truly ran as efficiently as people believed. The model, a type of extreme gradient-boosting model, consisted of an ensemble of thousands of decision trees that had been engineered to include a great deal of metallurgical knowledge. The staff at Bagdad and Freeport-McMoRan’s central operations group believed all the ore entering the mill was of the same type. Consequently, they had defined a single “recipe” of lower and upper parameters for the mill’s 42 control settings: the mix of differently sized ore chunks being fed into the mill, the pH level in the flotation cells, and so on. But when the agile team at Bagdad ran the data from the mill’s performance sensors through its model, the members of the team learned something new. From the mill’s perspective, the mine was actually producing seven distinct types of ore. What’s more, the mill’s standard recipe for control settings didn’t match the properties of all those ore types. Ore containing more iron pyrite, for example, would yield more copper if the pH level in the flotation cells were set higher than the recipe prescribed. “Thinking about ore clusters in terms of data from the mill’s instruments, rather than classifications from traditional geology, was a major mind-set shift—and it opened up many new possibilities for improving performance,” said Sean Buckley, a McKinsey partner who led the analytics work. All told, the team’s analysis suggested that adjusting the mill’s controls to suit each of the seven ore types could increase copper production by 10 percent or more. That prospect convinced Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders to let the agile team at Bagdad build an AI model that would look at the ore coming into the mill and suggest control settings to heighten production of copper from that ore. Change that Matters Team members wrote algorithms to discern the connections among the ore type, the operational readings from the plant’s sensors, the amount of ore running through the mill, and the amount of copper recovered. Next, they developed more algorithms to predict the plant’s performance based on measurements from the sensors. After several weeks of development sprints, the team members had raised the accuracy of the model’s performance predictions to 96 percent—high enough to know that the model was properly interpreting the data streaming in from the mill’s sensors and relating it to the mill’s control settings. To determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, staff decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. The team then turned its attention from predicting performance to improving it. Staff began by asking a simple question that no one had asked in some time: What measure of performance do we want to optimize? For years, the team at Bagdad had oriented its decisions and activities toward particular targets for copper production and operating cost. That approach made a certain kind of sense. It meant that Bagdad consistently generated profits. Now, to determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, the team decided to establish a new mandate— maximizing copper production at a reasonable cost, with little new capital investment. Cross and Cory Stevens, Freeport-McMoRan’s vice president of operational improvement, knew that maximizing production could lessen Bagdad’s performance in other areas. The mill’s recovery rate—the percentage of copper extracted from the ore—might drop. Or the whole operation could come to a halt for hours. Stevens went to other executives to explain that Bagdad’s experiment could be costly. The performance numbers they’d see for the next few months might be dismal, he warned. Nonetheless, the executives agreed with Stevens that if Bagdad could achieve the 10 percent increase in production that the model predicted, the short-term cost would be worth it. They gave him the go-ahead to try maximizing production. With that approval, Cross granted Bagdad’s staff the latitude to make operational changes that deviated from standard procedures and could cause the mill to miss its performance targets. Worker safety and equipment integrity were the only areas where no compromises or experiments would be allowed. Any other changes were fair game. A big breakthrough Over a series of iterations during the next month or so, the team conceived, tested, and refined algorithms that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend control settings to maximize copper output. The new algorithms, known as genetic algorithms, used the principles of natural selection to “evolve” settings that would produce the most copper, given a particular type of ore. By early September, the team had expanded the prediction model into an MVP of an optimization model, dubbed TROI, that was capable of issuing recommendations every 12 hours, once for each of the mill’s two daily shifts. When each new set of recommendations came out, the engineers, equipment operators, and metallurgists on the team would huddle and decide what do to with them. TROI was a work in progress, so its earliest recommendations weren’t entirely reliable. At every shift, metallurgists from Freeport-McMoRan and from McKinsey would study the model’s recommendations and question whether they were credible. Then the metallurgists would take note of the problem recommendations so the agile team could look into them. Some recommendations led the team members to discover flaws in TROI’s logic, which they added to their backlog and corrected in subsequent development sprints. Others indicated that the underlying performance data were faulty and prompted the team to look for fixes. “TROI helps us to improve the quality of our instrumentation and highlights sensors that need attention,” said Frank Ochoa, one of Bagdad’s process-control and instrumentation engineers. Most challenging were the model’s recommendations to depart from the operational recipe that the staff at Bagdad had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Most challenging were the recommendations to depart from the operational recipe the staff had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those. Gradually, as the team fine-tuned TROI, its recommendations became more plausible, and the staff at Bagdad began following them. Yet many of those recommendations resulted in slim performance gains,\nif any. Mid-October arrived. The team was nowhere close to the 10 percent production boost it thought possible. Cross and Stevens decided it was time to act on a weighty recommendation that no one was especially eager to try: speeding the flow of ore from the mine and the crusher to the mill. Cross asked the mine operators to redline their activities—and reassured them that they wouldn’t be blamed for spending more money or triggering operational breakdowns. The mine operators ramped up blasting, even though they had to use more explosives. They queued up trucks to carry rocks to the crushing plant, in violation of a long-standing directive to keep trucks from standing idle. They choke-fed the giant crusher with run-of-mine, or unprocessed, ore to find out how much it could handle. Finally, on October 19, the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate. Right away, copper production jumped 5 percent. TROI had helped the team unlock a record level of performance. Small gains add up Having achieved a major performance gain, Bagdad’s agile team turned to enhancing the model’s ability to recommend mill-control settings that would increase copper production. The agile team reviewed the data model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day and kept working through a backlog of upgrades. Within several weeks, the team had refined the model to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. TROI could already identify which type of ore was running through the mill at any moment. In the next round of sprints, the team added functions to account for other incoming operational data. Each time TROI recommended a set of control settings, the metallurgists at the plant would consider the recommendations, choose which ones to accept, and pass them to shift supervisors and operators, who would adjust the mill’s controls accordingly. Letting the metallurgists decide which recommendations to follow helped the agile team learn more quickly. Occasionally, the metallurgists applied settings that looked questionable just to find out whether they would work. And when the metallurgists rejected the recommended settings, they typed notes into the model to explain their decisions. “TROI doesn’t always give fully accurate recommendations, but it provides a new perspective on how to manage the plant and challenges our assumptions,” said Lulu Raymond, a senior metallurgist at Bagdad. All the while, sensors gauged the mill’s performance. The model’s machine-learning algorithms recorded which settings improved performance and which ones didn’t, and whether the recommendations were helping. The agile team reviewed the model’s recordings and the metallurgists’ notes every day, added items to the backlog of upgrades it planned to make, and kept working on those upgrades. By early December, the team had refined TROI to the point that metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent of its recommendations. It wasn’t long before the metallurgists and mill operators began trying to outsmart TROI. They would monitor the type of ore passing into the mill, anticipate the control settings that the model might suggest, and apply those settings before the model made its twice-daily recommendations (later increased to every three hours). This became a kind of competition: Who can run the mill better than TROI would? Most important, the mill’s production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bagdad’s throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day—10 percent more than the previous quarter—while its copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point and its operations became more stable (exhibit). The following quarter, copper production at Bagdad went up yet again. Those gains should lift Bagdad’s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200 million capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex. We think this is just the beginning for Freeport-McMoRan. Having learned to maintain TROI during the project, the company’s metallurgists and data scientists now run the model themselves, without ongoing support from McKinsey. They study daily and weekly reports that compare the mill’s performance with TROI’s predictions, and they continue enhancing the model’s ability to make recommendations. Freeport-McMoRan executives have also sponsored the creation of a second agile team at Bagdad to test and make process improvements at the mine. This team, too, is working without help from McKinsey, using the agile methods that it learned on the mill project. At another one of Freeport-McMoRan’s Arizona copper mines, Morenci, managers have kicked off an agile and analytics effort like Bagdad’s. And the company will soon launch its most ambitious program of this kind at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in Peru with five times the capacity of Bagdad. The age of the operator is here, and Freeport-McMoRan is adapting to it with agile methods and AI tools. Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of Freeport-McMoRan.

But based on trends that have been reshaping other industries, competition in real estate has spread to another area: customer experience. How engaged, productive, comfortable, connected, and safe we feel in our physical environment matters, and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for significant changes in the real estate industry . Practically overnight, for example, physical distancing and the need for contactless interaction have magnified the importance of digital within real estate. Pioneers in the industry have been exploring ways to diversify sources of revenue, pursuing new digitally-enabled business models and focusing on tenant experience. The pandemic has made clear that those that haven’t yet made such investments in underlying capabilities and infrastructure will need to catch up quickly. Leap by McKinsey “The future of real estate is no longer about delivering four walls to tenants,” says RXR CEO Scott Rechler . “Instead, it’s about creating a unique, personalized customer experience that fosters meaningful interactions, collaboration, productivity. Delivering this will require a unique combination of capabilities that seamlessly integrate across the physical and digital realms.” The joint Leap-RXR team has built products and services for residents that enhance their living experiences. One innovation is a new RXR app that is anchored around a resident experience officer. Designed, created, and launched by the team, the app allows residents to manage elements of their personal lives, like moving into an apartment, and use digitally-enabled concierge services for services like housekeeping and grocery delivery. Tenants can also submit and manage maintenance requests through the platform and make rent payments seamlessly. The entire experience is powered by a robust data and analytics infrastructure that is uniquely tailored and personalized, and enables staff to manage buildings in a customer-centric way. “There’s a huge opportunity to get more use out of data that these digital products create,” says Vaibhav Gujral , a McKinsey partner. “We can uniquely personalize services and experiences to tenants based on information that is made available at the right place at the right time.” Real estate is no longer just about four walls and relying on location for value appreciation. On the commercial office side, RXR is implementing new technologies to help monitor energy efficiency and environmental conditions. As companies consider what office space will look like in the return to work after coronavirus, these capabilities have positioned RXR to move with agility. For instance, the infrastructure created by RXR with Leap’s support enabled the company to respond quickly to the coronavirus, including the launch of a new comprehensive, data-driven program initiative called RxWell. “Helping to ensure an environment that prioritizes safety and wellness is particularly important in light of the coronavirus,” Rechler adds. Leap, according to McKinsey partner Jennifer Kilian , is all about bringing start-up thinking to established organizations. “In this case, that meant working with RXR to build its digital muscle,” she says. Jennifer explains that for any business to change how it creates value for customers, a diverse set of skills is needed across design, data science, advanced analytics, and business. The Leap team helped RXR determine which new roles to create and hire for. After outlining the criteria, they sourced and filled positions like software developers, data scientists, and agile coaches to ensure that the capabilities would live on beyond the initial phases of the project. Through our partnership, the company has built proprietary digital capabilities which are especially unique in the real estate industry, which will enable the organization to move with speed and agility. Building new businesses: How incumbents use their advantages to accelerate growth “Digital solutions have democratized access to experiences and conveniences for individuals and companies,” says Clay Cowan , a McKinsey partner. As people have grown accustomed to digital experiences  like online banking, tele-health, or eCommerce for example, “they expect similar from the spaces in which they live, work, play, and shop.” “We see this work as a catalyst for the rest of the industry across geographies,” says Aditya Sanghvi , a McKinsey senior partner. “Our aspiration is for this to set a new standard and benchmark for how real estate developers, owners, and operators start to think creatively about how they can create better experiences for their customers.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Superheating can be tricky to get right. Steel reaches more than 1600 degrees Celsius during superheating, and the ideal temperature range spans only 15 degrees. If the steel comes out too hot, the equipment operators must slow the casting step. If the steel isn’t hot enough, it can “freeze” before it has been cast, which compromises its quality. The frontline operators at the secondary-metallurgy station were used to running the superheating process based on past experiences. They would consider prompts from control systems, which were loaded with standard formulas, and then decide what set points to apply so the steel temperature would end up in the target range. Most of the time, they heated two of every three batches of steel into the optimal range. That “strike rate” allowed them to complete 25 “heats” per day, but it also left room for improvement. Bringing the strike rate up to 85 percent or so would result in 28 to 30 heats per day, enough to boost throughput by roughly 8 to 12 percent, or 600 to 900 daily tons. The opportunity stood out to the plant managers, who had been given a mandate to improve the plant’s performance with advanced analytics. In early 2017, they devised a plan for building analytics models that would help frontline operators get better results from the superheating process and several other activities. Data scientists from Tata Steel and McKinsey used historical information from the plant to build and “train” a superheating-optimization model, which would examine real-time operational data and recommend process set points conducive to a higher strike rate. In addition, managers arranged for some employees to receive classroom training in data science, data engineering, and other advanced-analytics disciplines. At first, the superheating model proposed settings that consistently improved the strike rate. But as the mix of steel orders from customers began to differ from the mix of orders recorded in the model’s training data, the model started to generate faulty recommendations—which frontline operators ceased to follow. Employees who had gone through the classroom training tried to fix the model but found the problems too complex to correct using the basic skills they’d learned. Similar difficulties arose with the models being used elsewhere in the plant. Despite the setback, managers had seen how the advanced-analytics models reduced costs and raised output. Managers also realized that classroom training alone would not prepare employees to sustain those performance improvements. They concluded that the company would need to further cultivate employees’ analytics skills and transform their way of working. Their insight paid off. By building these capabilities, the plant would raise its performance to world-class levels and earn acclaim from the World Economic Forum in July 2019 as one of 44 Lighthouse sites that are leading in the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. What worked and what didn’t: Lessons from Kalinganagar’s analytics program Focus on business improvements, not technology improvements. Kalinganagar expanded its use of analytics quickly by targeting performance gains and building tech solutions to achieve them, rather than looking at available technologies and thinking of how to apply them. Develop analytics talent, instead of outsourcing it. When Kalinganagar’s first-wave analytics models needed updating, the plant didn’t have in-house specialists to fix them. Hands-on training enabled the plant to cultivate the analytics talent that it needed to scale up. Scale analytics to make it a part of everyone’s way of working. Moving beyond pilot projects produced enough value to convince holdouts to embrace working with analytics. Adoption also increased as frontline employees worked with specialists to create the tools and as managers recognized employees’ success using them. Preparing for analytics, well ahead of its time Tata Steel’s multiyear effort to develop analytics capabilities at the Kalinganagar plant can be traced to a decision that executives made in 2005, when the plant was first being designed and built. Analytics technologies were then years away from becoming readily applicable to businesses. Nevertheless, Tata Steel’s executives considered whether they should outfit the plant with instruments and sensors to monitor equipment and processes. Their decision was less clear-cut than it would have been today—remote-sensing equipment is now affordable and advanced analytics has been broadly adopted . But some executives and managers foresaw that spending money on data-collection gear would prove worthwhile, even though it wasn’t yet clear how the data would be used. Amit Kumar Chatterjee, the plant’s then-head of electrical maintenance, was among those pushing to make the early investment—and even he acknowledged that at the time, the potential applications for advanced analytics were undefined. “We didn’t have in mind how we’d use the data, except maybe for autonomous process controls. We were living in the world of physical science, where experience and equations matter most. Data science was not even on the horizon,” said Chatterjee. Even the makers of the plant’s machinery resisted adding instrumentation. “Still, we believed we should put on the sensors at that stage because we felt it would be a lot harder later on, when the uses for the data were known.” By the mid-2010s, the leaders of the Kalinganagar plant began looking closely at what they could do with the data the plant’s sensors were collecting. In 2015, T. V. Narendran, the managing director of Tata Steel, set out a $1 billion cost-optimization goal and called on the heads of the company’s plants to map a path toward that goal. One way of boosting performance, he suggested, was to do more with digital technology. Advances in hardware and data science had made it easier for companies to take big data sets, uncover patterns, and make predictions that could help them attain performance improvements. Leaders at Kalinganagar launched their own investigation into how the plant might apply data science. In 2016, they traveled to Germany and visited technology start-ups and large established companies to get a close look at what data science could do. Early the following year, the plant’s leaders resolved to start an advanced-analytics program at Kalinganagar. Beginning the analytics transformation Senior managers at Kalinganagar decided to try advanced analytics on several pilot projects. During a two-day workshop, managers and operations specialists worked with McKinsey experts to identify ten possible uses for analytics and selected three to focus on—one of which involved the superheating process in the plant’s secondary-metallurgy station. Managers wanted to create an advanced-analytics model that could assess conditions in the plant and calculate how much heat to apply during superheating so that the steel would emerge in the target temperature range. The team working on the superheating model sought to discern which variables were the most important determinants of the steel’s final temperature, and thereby learn how operators could improve the strike rate. They pulled together two years’ worth of operational data that had been generated by sensors or recorded manually in logbooks. Data scientists wrote algorithms to make connections among key factors: measures of the condition of the steel as it reached the secondary-metallurgy station, equipment settings that operators would adjust during the superheating cycle, and other settings that couldn’t be adjusted during a cycle but could be altered over time (such as the maximum rate of oxygen flow, capped by the equipment already in place). Preliminary results from several pilot projects convinced leaders at Tata Steel Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort. They laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve critical performance indicators and believed that analytics could help. After two weeks, the team had built a model capable of predicting, with 75 percent accuracy, whether a group of set-point recommendations would cause the molten steel to reach the casting station in the desired temperature range. The other two pilot-project teams built models of similar reliability. Although none of the models had yet been put to the test on the plant floor, the preliminary results convinced leaders at Kalinganagar to expand the analytics effort and create models that employees would actually use. In September 2017, leaders laid out five operational areas in which they wanted to improve the plant’s critical performance indicators—energy consumption, throughput, quality, and yield—and believed that analytics could help . They chose to carry over the work on the superheating model to the first full phase of the project. Together, the five areas had the potential to enhance margins by $10 million annually. Ramping up As operations teams and analytics specialists built the phase-one models, leaders at Kalinganagar sponsored an effort to begin training some 130 employees—which comprised one-quarter of the managerial staff—in analytics. With McKinsey, the plant set up an introductory analytics academy , installed a 15-member faculty, and created 50-hour curricula for five roles: digital champion, project owner, business translator, data scientist, and data engineer. Students performed simple practice exercises in line with the duties dictated by their roles. Although the models from the first phase worked well for a time, they started to falter as conditions in the plant deviated from the conditions that the models had been optimized for. The employees who had been through the academy tried to fix the models but could not do so using the basic techniques they’d learned by that point. And they had yet to work as apprentices on analytics projects, which would have given them hands-on experience retraining models. They simply needed more real-world exposure to analytics. Challenges also arose as frontline operators tried to start working with the models. Shailendra Rai, the chief of blast-furnace operations at Kalinganagar, recalled that operators never became comfortable with a model that had been created to help improve the stability of the blast furnace: “Most people spend 20 or 30 years learning how to operate a blast furnace. They thought that the model would be this magical solution. When the initial output from the model didn’t match their beliefs, they couldn’t understand why. They weren’t convinced it would work. The buy-in wasn’t there.” Supporting an analytics transformation: A leader’s view by Rajiv Kumar After the first phase of the analytics transformation at Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, I saw that managers needed to put more emphasis on developing the capabilities of the plant’s workforce. I also recognized that I should make the transformation a top priority. This kind of transformation succeeds when everyone buys in—and for buy-in to develop, leaders must show they’ve bought in, too. To signal the transformation’s importance, I announced that Kalinganagar wouldn’t undertake any other big initiatives until the plant had developed the capabilities to build and deploy analytics solutions on its own. Consistency and stability are important in steelmaking, so changing the way we do things can be hard. I knew that if everyone’s attention was divided between multiple change initiatives, the analytics transformation would be more likely to slow down or stall out. I also began holding “skip-level meetings” with junior members of our workforce who were being trained as analytics specialists or learning to use analytics in frontline jobs. The analytics work wasn’t easy, so I wanted to hear firsthand about it, just as I do when I walk around the plant and talk to equipment operators and technicians. Having a feel for how things are going on the plant floor is important. Then, in the second phase of the transformation, I required managers from the plant to give updates on the analytics projects they were working on. All my questions went to Tata Steel employees as well. It was another way to reinforce the idea that analytics is part of how our plant now operates. Rajiv Kumar is vice president of operations for Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Doubling down on capabilities The model-building exercise confirmed what leaders at Kalinganagar had expected: that analytics could deliver significant and valuable performance improvements. It also convinced leaders to make further investments in employees’ capabilities so they could sustain the performance improvements and take analytics into other areas . In mid-2018, leaders chose to initiate a second phase of the program in which analytics specialists and frontline operators would develop and implement models to aid their decisions and receive hands-on training in analytics, with McKinsey’s help. For the team building the superheating model, analytics specialists from Tata Steel took a refresher course in the skills they’d studied at the academy. Then they were assigned to perform certain development tasks—augmenting the user interface, simplifying the database, retraining the model, deploying new modeling techniques and approaches—in collaboration with experienced practitioners from McKinsey. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists were assigned to perform development tasks in collaboration with experienced practitioners. By having employees work on these real-world tasks, managers were preparing them to create analytics models on their own. Analytics specialists also spent extra time working with the employees who controlled the superheating process at the secondary-metallurgy station. They asked more questions about the process to fine-tune the model. Specialists watched the operators at work and talked with them about ways of making the model easier to use. Operators cited numerous difficulties, from faulty computer hardware to clunky user interfaces, that the analytics team helped resolve. The analytics team explained how they had developed the model and how it worked, because they wanted operators to trust its recommendations. “All the employees at Kalinganagar had been trained to make decisions based on their experience. When problems happened, they would try to solve them with physical equations—put in raw materials and heat, get a certain output. They do look at data. But with data science, they can connect many more data points than we can with physical science. Even if they don’t have a physical equation to explain why something is happening, they can still figure it out with data. That was a new belief system that had to be built up,” said Chatterjee. After around six months, the superheating squad had built a model capable of recommending process set points that would raise the superheating strike rate to 90 percent. Now it was time for frontline operators to begin using the model on a regular basis. Managers kept track of who used the model and who didn’t and celebrated the accomplishments of the most devoted users. Employees went from following 60 percent of the model’s recommendations to following 85 percent in a couple of months. Taking analytics to scale When the second phase concluded, the plant’s leadership raised the bar once more. They called for a third phase, in which Tata Steel employees would select, lead, and deliver analytics projects related to each of the plant’s main areas: core processes, power, and utilities. McKinsey consultants would move into coaching roles on the employee-led project teams. To focus their efforts, these teams set improvement goals for more than 25 performance indicators, such as the daily tonnage of pig iron produced by the plant’s blast furnace. Because several of those indicators pertained to the superheating process, it again emerged as a priority for analytics work. The plant’s analytics specialists had learned enough about data science by then to take charge of the superheating model. They narrowed its target temperature range. They also added the ability to predict how much cooling would take place between the secondary-metallurgy station and the casting station. This helped operators manage the transfer better and increase throughput. Frontline operators followed the model’s recommendations even more closely. As a result, the superheating model produced the annual cost savings of $4 million that had been estimated at the outset of the analytics program. Comparable gains accrued elsewhere in the plant. For each of the 25-plus performance indicators, teams realized at least 80 percent of the targeted improvements. Their efforts yielded $70 million to $80 million of value and two to three percentage points of EBITDA 1 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. uplift. And in July 2019, the World Economic Forum announced that an independent panel of experts in the Fourth Industrial Revolution had recognized the Kalinganagar plant’s digital achievements as leading edge and named it a Lighthouse facility —making it the first such plant in India. Looking ahead The Kalinganagar plant now has a cohort of more than 30 analytics specialists, including data scientists and translators. The most experienced have become in-house instructors and coaches and are responsible for helping other colleagues learn new skills in data science, business-case development, and other key domains. With analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support. Analytics knowledge has also suffused the plant’s day-to-day work, changing the way that many employees solve problems. As Shailendra Rai, the head of blast-furnace operations, said, “If you talk to five blast furnace operators, they will have five different opinions about how to solve a problem. In a way, all five are correct—everyone’s speaking based on their own experience. But with analytics models, people have become more data oriented. Instead of debating the right answer, they can dig into the data and find it, and create an analytics model to provide decision support.” With these capabilities, managers have drawn up a slate of more than 20 additional use cases, and they are reinforcing the use of analytics where it’s already in place. For Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, analytics has become more than a tool for answering questions—it’s an integral part of the plant’s operations and culture.

When the 36th edition began in early March, the race’s defending champion, Emirates Team New Zealand, hit the water having utilized a new crewmember: an AI bot created by McKinsey. It turned out to be a winning combination. On March 17, the Kiwis successfully defended their title against the Italian challengers, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, winning their fourth America’s Cup. The America’s Cup has always been as much about technology and innovation as it is about sailing. Boat designs are governed by the competition’s “ Class Rule , ” which leaves small opportunities for design tweaks that might give one team an advantage over another. If brilliantly seized, those opportunities can translate into a shining race-day performance. Our goal was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. The Class Rule for this year’s race, published in March 2018, required the two competing teams to sail a 75-foot vessel. It’s not your typical sailboat. Hydrofoils fixed to the hull lift the entire craft out of the water, enabling it to reach speeds exceeding 60 mph, or 100 kph. Most importantly, the hydrofoils are one part of the boat where the Class Rule allowed for design modifications, which offered huge competitive advantages for the teams that got those modifications right. Doing so, according to McKinsey senior partner Brian Fox, required intensive testing—and lots of it. “Every boat in the America’s Cup is designed with a computer simulator,” says Brian, who sails competitively. “Whichever team has the best simulator, and uses it most effectively, gains the advantage.” In 2019, Emirates Team New Zealand partnered with McKinsey to begin an innovative project seeking that advantage. What they needed, they soon realized, was a new kind of crew member that could sail thousands of boats at a time. The answer to that call was an AI bot, or software robot, that could test new hydrofoil designs by sailing them on Emirates Team New Zealand’s simulator. Creating value beyond the hype The simulator had been key to the team’s victory in 2017; the sailors had used it to test new boat designs without having to actually build them. But that simulator required multiple team members using it simultaneously for it to work properly. This was a logistical challenge, given the sailors’ scheduled practices, travel, and competitions. “Our goal,” Brian explains, “was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. By developing an AI bot that could run the simulator by itself, we no longer had to manage around the sailors’ limited availability.” As a first step, the McKinsey team, which included colleagues from our analytics firm QuantumBlack , turned to the cloud. Over six-weeks, data, analytics, and machine-learning experts from Sydney, Melbourne, and London migrated New Zealand’s simulator and developed an infrastructure to run it in the cloud. Then our team used a new and innovative approach called deep reinforcement learning to essentially teach the AI bot how to become a professional sailor. The technique allowed the bot to learn dynamically and gain greater accuracy through continuous feedback. Nic Hohn , one of the key project leaders, explains. “When you start, the AI agent knows nothing and learns by trial and error using countless variables—wind speed, direction, adjustments to the 14 different sail and boat controls—and is refined again and again,” Nic says. “Since the bot keeps experimenting, if you coach it to learn in the right way, it compresses into hours what would take a human years to understand.” This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat. The work was highly technical, according to QuantumBlack’s chief scientist Jacomo Corbo, and it required  extensive innovation around the bot’s learning program. “At this point in the project, a lot of creative thinking had to be done to figure out the right learning models, how best to coach the bot, and the right guard rails and rewards to put into place.” The team also created a network that allowed multiple bots to share information as they each learned to sail. This was a critical breakthrough, as it allowed the individual bots to gain knowledge from their collective experience. Ultimately, there were a thousand bots running in parallel, learning from each other. “It's learning at a huge scale and it dramatically reduces the time and cost of the project,” says Nic. “That's the power of the cloud.” Within two weeks, the bot was sailing in a straight line, upwind and downwind. After mastering the basics, it graduated to more complex sailing maneuvers. The turning point came about eight weeks later, when the AI bot started beating the sailors in the simulator. At this point, the bot became the ideal way to test variations of the hydrofoils; it was more consistent and more scalable than the sailors, speeding the cycles of design iterations dramatically. “This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat,” observes Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and member of the QuantumBlack leadership team in Europe, who is also a world champion sailor. Soon, the sailors were learning maneuvers from the bot. “With such a steep development curve, accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable,” explains Oliver Fleming , an expert associate partner, “both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, the bot sped New Zealand’s design process by a factor of ten. The race’s outcome proves that reinforcement learning can be a transformational tool for process design, with potential applications across industries. “This has been one of the most complex deployments of deep reinforcement learning in the public cloud,” says Jacomo. “One way to think about the difficulty of the problem: game-tree complexity roughly tallies the size of the space one has to navigate while accounting for the set of possible game paths, or the sequence of decisions, that need to be taken. Go , which is an extremely complex board game, has a game-tree complexity of 170—our sailing problem has a game-tree complexity of nearly 2900.” Mastering such technical complexity, particularly in this application, has heightened this project’s excitement for everyone involved. “It is thrilling to be using technology and AI to master the wind and water and go as fast as you possibly can,” says Nic. “This is not sailing as we know it—it's much closer to flying a low-altitude aircraft.” To learn more about our work in AI, visit QuantumBlack .
