Composed of 300 Black executives who exemplify exceptional leadership, Savoy’s annual list honors the best in today’s talent from companies across industries, such as Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe’s Companies, and Scott Mills, president and CEO of BET Media Group. Tiffany joined McKinsey in 2010 and became senior partner and office managing partner for Atlanta in 2022. A leader in the firm’s global Consumer Practice, she serves organizations on broad transformation efforts to significantly increase performance. She has also had a major impact on the firm’s diversity and inclusion work, helping launch programs that have touched thousands. Here, she reflects on some of the milestones of her career. On mentorship and sponsorship I joined the firm in the Atlanta location; Atlanta was one of the most diverse locations in North America but still had no Black partners or senior partners at that time. I was lucky to have people like former Atlanta office managing partner Tom Barkin, who treated me like I really belonged, because without representation, sometimes you look around and you’re not so sure. There were also other senior partners in the office who sponsored me. They all set a high bar, pushed me to their level, and trusted me to deliver. There’s no better boot camp than working with people who are the best and make you rise to their level. In my current role, I’ve worked with my colleagues in Atlanta—such as partner Darius Bates , who leads the Atlanta chapter of our affinity group McKinsey Black Network—on ensuring that Black and other underrepresented colleagues have equitable access to mentorship and sponsorship, because it’s not a given. No one comes to the firm knowing how to be a McKinsey consultant, so it’s critical that all colleagues, including our diverse colleagues, have the opportunity to build these networks that will support them and provide good, direct feedback. When I became a senior partner along with Shelley Stewart III , we committed to keep the same intensity of focus to bring up the next generation of Black senior partners in North America. On creating the firm’s 10 actions toward racial equity in 2020 When George Floyd was murdered, I was pregnant with my first child. I thought, “This can’t be the world that my child is going to be living in.” My McKinsey colleagues and I knew that it was a moment where we could have an indelible impact on our firm and accelerate our long-held objectives to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion. It was a challenging and sad context, but our commitment to action was energizing. Over about two weeks, senior leaders across our firm met daily and asked how McKinsey could make a difference and what bold aspirations would look like for us. We wanted to help build capabilities for Black executives and asked ourselves what a McKinsey-level goal could be. We knew that if our aspiration wasn’t arduous, and if it didn’t make us uncomfortable, then we hadn’t hit the mark. This mentality led us to our ambitious 10 actions : double our number of Black leaders and colleagues hired, create the Institute for Black Economic Mobility and the Black Leadership Academy, boost our pro bono efforts, and more. We knew that if our aspiration wasn’t arduous, and if it didn’t make us uncomfortable, then we hadn’t hit the mark. At every turn, we had the firm’s support to make this happen, so we could dream big. It was a very fulfilling, once-in-a-lifetime moment. I am still amazed at how our full firm rose to the challenge to make something “only McKinsey” happen from inspiration to execution. On social change through consulting Early on, I worked with a Black founder who was sharp, charismatic, and inspiring and had scaled his business to close to a billion-dollar valuation. This made a tremendous impact on me because there aren’t many Black founders that have reached that level. A light bulb went off for me, about how the firm had the potential to make a real difference with these types of organizations. I’m very grateful that my work in leading transformations with retail and consumer companies has given me a platform to support greater equity for Black founders and Black consumers. Some of the most inspiring work that I’ve done at the firm was helping to architect Next 1B , a no-cost business accelerator that aims to help Black founders build the next generation of Black-owned brands. Making a difference was a true team effort of amazing McKinsey partners and colleagues: Tyler Rose, Pamela Brown, Jon McClain, Alexis Wolfer, John R. Moran, Sara Prince, Shelley Stewart III, Liz Pharis, Brooke Daniels, and Jalen Walker. We were sponsored by Eric Kutcher, Becca Coggins, and Sajal Kohli. I’ve also been able to work on some of the research and community-building efforts we’ve done in the Black beauty space. If you would’ve asked me when I started at McKinsey if I would be able to do the types of things I’m doing now, I wouldn’t have thought it was possible. But I’ve truly been able to “make my own McKinsey” over the past few years, both in client service and in helping to support diverse communities. I’m so happy about where I’ve been able to take my work, and the impact it’s made, and I’m excited to continue because there is still so much more to be done. related More than 700 new tech colleagues to join McKinsey in Atlanta Never miss a story"
McKinsey named a Leader in Cybersecurity Consulting Services by Forrester,"McKinsey was designated a Leader in cybersecurity consulting services, the highest ranking possible. This post explains what makes the firm&rsquo;s cybersecurity practice unique.",2024-05-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20named%20a%20leader%20in%20cybersecurity%20by%20forrester/forrestercybersec-hero-small-1480959457-1536x864.jpg,"Resilience,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-named-a-leader-in-cybersecurity-by-forrester,"McKinsey named a Leader in Cybersecurity Consulting Services by Forrester May 9, 2024 McKinsey has been recognized as a Leader in cybersecurity consulting services, the highest designation possible, in The Forrester Wave™: Cybersecurity Consulting Services, Q2 2024 report. Forrester evaluated 15 providers on 24 criteria. McKinsey received the highest score possible on 11 of these, including Cybersecurity strategy and vision delivery, and Customer retention and satisfaction. “Deep technology expertise matters most right now in this market,” according to the Forrester report, and our firm also ranked among the highest in the Use of emerging technologies in client delivery criterion. We recently caught up with Ida Kristensen , the McKinsey senior partner who leads our cybersecurity team and co-leads the Risk & Resilience Practice, to learn more about the work they do. What does this Forrester ranking of a ‘Leader’ in cybersecurity consulting services mean for you? We are incredibly proud of receiving this external recognition; for us, this is something to celebrate. It acknowledges what we have been hearing from our clients: that they value our unique ability to combine their strategic agenda—of their board, CEO, and executive management team—with our deep technical expertise. It wasn't always like this. The chief information security officer (CISO) within organizations used to be quite isolated. Management would say, “Thank you for doing your thing. We don't fully understand what you're doing, but good luck with it.” Now cybersecurity has become such a strategic imperative for institutions that all parties—from the CEO to the front lines—need to both inform and understand the strategy. It influences all aspects of a business: designing new products and services, upgrading technologies, managing supply chains and customers, and it’s a critical aspect of organizational transformations. Cybersecurity has become a business enabler, rather than a roadblock. Tell us more about McKinsey’s team In the past five years, our practice has undertaken some 570 projects across industries. We've tripled the size of our team to more than 240 cyber experts, many of whom are veterans from U.S. military and intelligence operations, and from the leadership and frontlines of cybersecurity organizations. Cybersecurity One thing that is unique from our usual practice is that our experts work across sectors, since cybersecurity isn’t industry specific. For example, they can credibly say to an industrial, tech or CPG client: “We should look at this new approach the financial services industry has been taking.” This makes them even better prepared to serve our clients. What work are you particularly proud of? We've served a number of clients who’ve experienced a very severe cyber-attack. We helped them restore operations, get back up on their feet, minimize the cost and implications from the attack, and used the opportunity to help them build greater resilience to move forward. And as terrible as it is, these crises can be a defining, learning moment. A second example at a micro level: we often conduct war games and tabletop exercises where there's this moment of revelation.  We recently did a three-hour ransomware exercise with a leader of a tech company. It was very fast paced and pulses were racing. As we were debriefing, the CEO said, “If this was real, I would now hand in my resignation because we were clearly not prepared for that.” He walked away knowing they would have to take a different approach. It was a small exercise, but the impact was profound, which makes me very proud. One of the interesting things is the human element…Ninety percent of all cyber-attacks start with a phishing attempt…it makes a big difference in all of us just getting wiser. How is gen AI impacting cybersecurity? It adds to the sophistication of the attacks. The ability to impersonate others, for example in creating very real videos, is leading to breaches of security. And the sophistication of phishing attempts has gone up wildly. The latest research shows that malicious phishing emails have increased 1,265% since the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Adversaries are now using gen AI to write emails that are much better. Companies are experiencing thousands of attacks on a daily basis.  In the past, it was just like throwing spaghetti against the wall—trying lot of different attacks to see which ones would go through. Now with gen AI, the attackers have an ability to learn as they go, seeing which ones are more effective, and updating the strategy in real time. Even if the volume doesn't go up, the success rate does. On the flip side, this same aspect of gen AI is helping companies learn in real-time which defenses and detections work best, so they can isolate attacks more quickly.  Companies are using gen AI to fight gen AI, if you will. Cyber risks are constantly changing. What makes you optimistic looking forward? We have evolved as a society to recognize this is a common problem. Significant resources from both public and private sectors are being invested, and different groups are collaborating to solve it. Governments are taking an active role and setting guidelines to protect security, privacy, and safety. One of the interesting things is the human element.  Ninety percent of all cyber-attacks start with a phishing attempt. Despite this being a very technical topic, a huge part of the defense is educating human beings. We've all obviously had the joys of the phishing exercises. But these things matter, right? If we educate everyone who has contact with this, it makes a big difference in all of us just getting wiser. related An inside look at how businesses are—or are not—managing AI risk Never miss a story"
McKinsey Health Institute&nbsp;<span>helps caring adults support children affected by trauma</span>,McKinsey Health Institute partnered with Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital Medical Center and mental health organizations to create training for youth who have experienced trauma.,2024-05-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mhi%20helps%20educators%20support%20children%20affected%20by%20trauma/strongyouth-hero-small-1498436295-1536x864.jpg,Healthcare,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mhi-helps-educators-support-children-affected-by-trauma,"McKinsey Health Institute helps caring adults support children affected by trauma May 10, 2024 “One of my students was disruptive and making inappropriate comments.  I stayed calm and looked at the situation from his perspective: I had learned his mom didn’t want him back at home and he was living with his uncle. I was able to understand his behavior, and the principal and I worked to get him into the therapy program that he needed.” This is just one example of the difference that Strong Resilient Youth , a free, online program is making. The training, developed by the Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), helps educators and supportive adults develop the knowledge and skills for recognizing and responding to trauma in children. Support children and youth experiencing trauma The program is grounded in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) four Rs. Kana Enomoto ,  a partner and MHI’s director of brain health, explains the concept: “It doesn’t train people to treat trauma, but it trains them to realize that trauma is ubiquitous—and very common in how it affects people. Participants can recognize trauma when they see it, respond appropriately to a person exhibiting the signs of being traumatized, and then resist doing something that exacerbates the trauma.” The Strong Resilient Youth program was born out of concern about the mental health of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. When the world was going into lockdown and schools moved online, teachers had a view into the home lives of children they had previously only seen in the classroom. “We talked to a lot of experts who were concerned about the stress on families and how that may play out for kids with potential increases in domestic violence or incidents of child abuse,” explained Kana. “In one school district survey, parents reported being more concerned about mental health than loss of learning. And there was a strong desire at the McKinsey Health Institute to do something that was accessible for teachers who were now seeing a different side of their students’ lives.” McKinsey Health Institute It was designed to help educators recognize the signs of trauma and de-escalate situations to move forward in a more productive and healing fashion. “We have worked together with school systems, after-school programs, and others to create a training that is responsive to the needs of kids and staff,” says Dr. Bob Shapiro, Director of the Mayerson Center. A typical scenario that plays out in classrooms is when a child is acting out, the teacher tells them to be calm or sit down. The child responds negatively because they are distressed, and the situation escalates. Participants learn to give the child some space, realize what’s going on, and ask questions like: ‘Would it help you to sit outside for ten minutes? Can I have someone come talk to you?’ “This gives the child agency in the situation and helps him or her self-regulate. And then life goes on,” explains Kana.  “We don’t have to go to the principal’s office; we don’t create a disciplinary problem.” Over the next year, the MHI and CCHMC teams worked with mental health and children’s organizations to develop the training, which featured experts from around the world. Learning practitioners from McKinsey Academy helped develop the curriculum while McKinsey Digital colleagues managed the tech aspects of the project. Within a year, the training was rolled out to schools in the US Midwest. It’s the pebble that creates a lot of ripples. If in that first interaction we can handle the trauma appropriately, we prevent so many downstream consequences. Then the invasion of Ukraine happened, and the Czech Republic was receiving a significant influx of Ukrainian children who were being placed in local schools. Given the volume of need, the training was rolled out to educators and caring adults, such as coaches, bus drivers, and aid workers. Dr. Tamara Baer , a McKinsey associate partner and a practicing pediatrician who focuses on healthcare for vulnerable populations, recalled hearing from a Czech social worker that the training “helped me get a better understanding of people’s behavior, and it became obvious that most of [my adult clients] experienced trauma in their childhood. Now, I can see them in a different light, and I understand them better.” The program was translated into Czech, Ukrainian, and Spanish; and in the US it has been made available through the National Council for Mental Wellbeing to certified teen and Youth Mental Health First Aid Instructors. “Certification in the free Strong Resilient Youth training equips MHFA Instructors and other caring adults with additional tools to help children and youth build resiliency and positive coping strategies, as they gain a deeper understanding of how trauma manifests itself in communities,” says Tramaine EL-Amin, vice president, Mental Health First Aid. Erica Coe , global co-leader of MHI who helped establish the program, is most proud of the fact that people are experiencing the training as life-changing. “It’s the pebble that creates a lot of ripples,” she says. “If in that first interaction we can handle the trauma appropriately, we prevent so many downstream consequences.” related 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis The “Missing Billion”: creating health equity through data for people with disabilities Never miss a story"

McKinsey and Microsoft drive business value creation with gen AI agents enabled by Copilot Studio,"Continuing their alliance, McKinsey and Microsoft are using the power of gen-AI-based agents to help organizations reinvent their enterprise and shared business services.",2024-05-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20expands%20alliance%20with%20microsoft%20to%20integrate%20new%20gen%20ai%20copilot%20solutions%20across%20enterprise%20services/microsoft-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-expands-alliance-with-microsoft-to-scale-copilot-solutions-across-enterprises,"McKinsey and Microsoft drive business value creation with gen AI agents enabled by Copilot Studio May 29, 2024 McKinsey is pleased to announce a new collaboration with Microsoft to use the power of generative AI (gen AI) agents to run independent complex processes across enterprise and shared services operations. This builds on the long-standing alliance McKinsey has with Microsoft to drive impact together for clients. Gen AI enterprise use cases could yield $2.6 trillion  to 4.4 trillion in annual economic benefit. Additionally, integrating gen AI and other technologies into business activities could enable the automation of up to 70 percent of the work hours in today's global economy. This is a crucial opportunity for leaders to proactively transform their organizations. This alliance will help organizations harness the value of gen AI by bringing together Microsoft’s Copilot Studio with McKinsey's deep strategy, organizational, change management, digital and implementation expertise. This collaboration is part of McKinsey’s open ecosystem of leading gen AI innovators , which is led by the firm's AI consulting arm QuantumBlack. QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey The collaboration will offer an end-to-end transformation approach that will focus on helping businesses re-imagine their core workflows with Microsoft’s Copilot Studio, to ensure adoption of the tools and the new processes that workforces need to improve service quality, and enable growth and efficiency. McKinsey brings vast experience with over 7,000 tech experts, engineers, and data scientists who partner with over 500+ clients annually to build and deploy tech-enabled solutions. McKinsey will develop several lighthouse solutions, built on Copilot Studio, to help advance clients through the next phase of gen AI. Led by principles of Rewired: The McKinsey guide to outcompeting in the age of digital and AI , and McKinsey’s digital transformation roadmap , McKinsey will work with Microsoft to develop a playbook for the next generation of gen AI agents. “We are thrilled to collaborate with McKinsey and apply our Microsoft Copilot Studio capabilities towards helping businesses achieve their digital innovation goals with agents. This technology enables us to reshape business automation as we know it and will unlock significant transformation for organizations and their customers,”  says Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president, Business Applications & Platforms, Microsoft. The promise and the reality of gen AI agents in the enterprise Gen AI-enabled agents hold the promise of accelerating the automation of a very long tail of workflows that would otherwise require inordinate amounts of resources to implement. Microsoft’s new Copilot Studio Agents are a meaningful step towards accelerating enterprise adoption: “All of this means that gen AI agents are getting much closer to becoming true “virtual workers” that can both augment and automate enterprise services in all areas of the business, from HR to finance to customer service,” explains Lari Hämäläinen , a senior partner at McKinsey. Our research shows that 60 to70 percent of the work hours in today’s global economy could theoretically be automated by applying a wide variety of existing technology capabilities, including gen AI. For customer operations specifically, research shows more than $400 billion of potential value from gen AI is at stake. Gen AI agents are an important step towards this value creation. AI-powered Copilot agents can run end-to-end workflows in collaboration with human employees who can then focus on higher value-add activities. In addition, they can collaborate with each other just like teams who are managed by human supervisors. Businesses can achieve holistic end-to-end impact as AI-powered copilot agents function across historically siloed workflows to manage entire processes. “We are excited to work with Microsoft to help our clients rewire their businesses with the latest in AI and cloud technology. Our joint efforts will enable enterprises to serve their customers and employees more efficiently and effectively across enterprise solutions, ultimately driving growth and success,” states Rodney Zemmel , senior partner and global leader of McKinsey Digital. Organizations are excited about the power of gen AI in customer care. In a recent article , Jorge Amar , a McKinsey senior partner, notes the progress he has already started to see with clients. “Over the past year, we have seen a lot of successful pilots with gen AI agents helping to improve the customer service functions. For example, you could have a customer service agent who is on the phone with a customer and receives help in real-time from a dedicated gen AI agent that is, for instance, recommending the best knowledge article to refer to or what the best next steps are for the conversation.” Leaders have already started seeing the impacts gen AI agents can have on their business. In a recent McKinsey interview, Linda Yao, head of the AI Center of Excellence at Lenovo, said, “With our gen AI agents helping support customer service, we’re seeing double-digit productivity gains on call handling time. And we’re seeing incredible gains in other places too. We’re finding that marketing teams are cutting the time it takes to create a great pitch book by 90 percent.” McKinsey is committed to helping businesses evolve and innovate. Together with Microsoft, we are actively developing use cases with lighthouse clients and creating a holistic copilot agent roadmap. related McKinsey and Microsoft join forces to accelerate decarbonization transformations Never miss a story"

Informed by the digital transformation roadmap and approach described in Rewired: The McKinsey guide to outcompeting in the age of digital and AI , Value Finder rapidly analyzes and prioritizes thousands of potential process-optimization opportunities for clients—using a proprietary McKinsey and SAP technology portfolio with gen AI—to capture measurable productivity growth and asset efficiency benefits enabled by SAP S/4HANA transformations. Value Finder builds on the long-standing alliance McKinsey has with SAP. It is a complement to the Generative Enterprise offering launched by McKinsey and SAP in January to unlock synergies between SAP Business AI and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey to help leaders build sustainable, resilient, and adaptive businesses. “We are thrilled to collaborate with SAP to bring this new capability to our clients and continue accelerating their journey to capture value from their ERP-enabled digital transformations,” says McKinsey senior partner Bjørnar Jensen. By using a suite of proprietary McKinsey and SAP technology—including SAP Signavio process analysis and optimization solutions, McKinsey’s gen AI solution Lilli , and SAP Business AI —Value Finder analyzes thousands of value levers, hundreds of industry benchmarks, and trends to enable rapid, precise, and actionable assessments of business-process improvements across clients’ SAP S/4HANA transformations. “This is a great flagship example of how we bring the power of our gen AI strategic alliance ecosystem to drive impact for our clients,” explains Ben Ellencweig, a senior partner who leads alliances, acquisitions, and partnerships globally for QuantumBlack, the AI consulting arm of McKinsey. “Value Finder is transforming how we serve our clients as value orchestrators, leveraging SAP and McKinsey technology.” Creating value beyond the hype Value Finder has already been deployed successfully at several companies, demonstrating significant benefits. At a global agribusiness company planning an SAP S/4HANA transformation, Value Finder uncovered over $100 million in process-optimization opportunities. McKinsey and SAP worked with Brenntag to unlock business-process insights as the anchor point across its SAP S/4HANA journey and identified value potential five times compared to the original business case. A major chemicals company leveraged Value Finder to re-baseline its SAP S/4HANA business case, certify value capture with the board, and identify 10 to 15 percent potential incremental benefits in order-to-cash. The capability has also delivered impact at McKinsey. Following our recent SAP S/4HANA transformation, Value Finder was applied to compare process performance indicators against industry benchmarks. “ While some process performance indicators were at par or better, we were able to identify several meaningful opportunities to improve and unlock value in spend optimization and cash collection due to divergent S/4HANA process execution patterns ,” says Nitin Khapre , the director of finance, innovation, and technology who led the McKinsey technology transformation. “These are just a few real-world examples of the difference Value Finder is already making for our clients and within McKinsey,” says Darwin Deano , a McKinsey partner and architect of Generative Enterprise. “We are proud of what we’re helping them achieve, and they inspire us to do even more. We will continue to raise our ambitions and push this work farther to help business leaders prepare for future challenges and build true resilience: the ability to thrive in a world of relentless disruption.” “We are excited about the capabilities of Value Finder and the profound impact it has already had on our clients' transformation journeys,” says Rouven Morato, general manager and chief revenue officer SAP Signavio and SAP LeanIX. “This tool is a testament to our commitment to co-innovation and our focus on delivering sustainable value and impact through technology.” related McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation McKinsey and SAP join forces to maximize business transformation value through cloud solutions Never miss a story"

But he was also troubled by the amount of good food that would go to waste. At one restaurant, Matt and fellow cooks threw out every romaine leaf to get to the last two baby leaves. And if those two weren’t facing each other, they couldn’t be plated and went in the trash. “I’m really inspired by practicality and execution. As I saw how much food was thrown away, I wondered if this fine dining precision existed in the emergency food space,” says Matt. “I quickly discovered that it didn’t and became obsessed with building a system that delivered food equitably and sustainably. I thought it was the most basic thing I could do—help take this food and ensure I can get it to somebody. Matt left the kitchen and founded Rethink Food in 2017 in New York City, a nonprofit working to bridge the gap between excess food and the communities that need it. It has since donated over 24 million meals and rescued over 2.4 million pounds of food from being wasted. What began as primarily a food rescue operation evolved into also providing small grants to restaurants to make meals for places like community centers and shelters. Historically, food is trucked into these facilities from large industrial kitchens outside New York City. Keeping food delivery local not only cuts down on emissions but supports neighborhood businesses and offers immigrant and ethnic communities food they know and like. “Instead of bringing in generic food from Pennsylvania to a senior center in Chinatown, we supported local restaurants to make the meals that match the needs and cultural preferences of the local community,” says Matt. “It just makes so much sense.” To scale this, Rethink Food would have to secure food contracts from New York City to provide meals at even more sites, such as schools. Could their model work on a large scale? That’s where McKinsey’s study came in. “We put the data behind Rethink Food’s thesis that this local-sourcing model has many benefits,” says Tejas Shah , a McKinsey partner in New York who led the pro bono team that conducted the study. The team developed a framework to compare and measure Rethink Food’s decentralized restaurant network to the centralized catering model by conducting a series of interviews and integrating insights from case studies and analyses to understand the impact of Rethink’s model and scaling potential. Having partnered with Rethink Food in 2020 to help respond to the major disruptions COVID-19 brought to restaurants and food systems in New York City, McKinsey believed in the organization’s model. “Rethink Food is pioneering a new way of addressing food insecurity that could potentially revolutionize how we solve this problem,” says Tejas. The study’s positive findings were exciting, but not surprising to the McKinsey team: the same dollar of funding for buying meals creates 50 percent more jobs through the Rethink model than the large-caterer model, and 75 percent of those jobs are local to New York City. “The city could be spending its food contract dollars on supporting local businesses and creating jobs,” says Tejas. “That’s quite significant.” The study also found that Rethink Food’s model delivers a higher share of funding to minority- or women-owned businesses, and the proportion of minority-identifying staff is more than 95 percent at Rethink Food restaurant partners. This diversity allows Rethink Food to offer culturally appropriate food, with 13 different cuisines on offer currently—though Matt has found that across cultures, “everyone likes pizza.” The study has been a major boon to Rethink Food, giving it a basis to talk to key stakeholders. It has helped secure contracts that have flowed $65 million to small business owners since the launch of the study. “We have restaurants calling every day wanting to work with us. All we need are the contracts and the funds,” says Matt. “The study is getting us there by showing that our model can be successfully scaled. That impact is huge.” related McKinsey co-founds effort to transform agriculture and food systems in Africa A relief effort accelerates and expands: The story behind 2.3 million saved meals Never miss a story"

It’s also when we reinforce our firm’s commitment to social mobility and socioeconomic diversity for the year ahead. As part of this commitment, we began hosting Student Insight Days in our London office in 2021, in partnership with education charity Into University. These events are more than just office tours; we invite local secondary-school students to step into the world of consulting. This offers underrepresented students the opportunity to explore potential careers and the core skills they require, helping them to make informed choices about how to shape their educational path. McKinsey in the United Kingdom During one of our recent Student Insight Days, we hosted 30 secondary students from North London. They met with our consultants, including the London office managing partner Tunde Olanrewaju , and took part in an innovation challenge to design a robot that benefits society. “Social mobility is central to our firm’s values, reflecting our commitment to being diverse and inclusive. We want everyone with the talent to join McKinsey to feel like they have the opportunity to succeed here, irrespective of their background,” says Philip Barber , a partner at McKinsey. “Almost every time we host these events, students tell us ‘This is a part of McKinsey I didn’t know existed.’  Just having them in the office is eye-opening both for us and them.” We hosted the event with our partner Into University, a UK-based charity that provides education programs for students facing disadvantage and barriers to progressing into higher education. Dr. Rachel Carr founded Into University when she was working with young people at a community center. “I started thinking about what I could do to support them. They’re amazing students—bright, smart, and capable—who just need a little bit of extra help to achieve their fantastic potential.” What began as a small project with 75 students has grown into a UK-wide organization that works with over 50,000 young people and 372 partner schools. “We’ve been very strategic about going where we are most needed,” Rachel states . “Our centers are based right where young people are— in coastal areas, post-industrial towns, as well as urban locations—basically wherever there’s a need.” These efforts are facilitated by Prism (Progressing Representation and Inclusion in Social Mobility), McKinsey’s internal community of colleagues passionate about the topic. It was formed in 2019 in the UK and is now active throughout Europe and beyond. Prism is open to all colleagues, and members come from a variety of backgrounds—including colleagues who are the first generation in their family to attend university, those who grew up in low-income or financially insecure households, and allies. Prism Prism members build connections through speaker and community events and volunteer their time to support our recruitment, retention, and outreach activities. In the London office, Prism also hosts events, including with schools, and through client roundtables, to engage leaders on their thinking in the social mobility space. As Peter Cooper , an associate partner at McKinsey says, “Every single year we grow in size, passion, and commitment. I don’t think there’s been a moment in the past five years where it’s felt like we’re slowing down.” As for what’s next in our work on social mobility, we’re planning to bring more insights to clients on economic diversity and how they can foster more inclusive organizations—including a report on social mobility for employers. “If young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not able to access certain careers or industries, then frankly we’re missing a huge amount of talent and not doing all we should be doing for society,” says Philip. “That’s why we’re so excited to continue bringing young people in to learn about our firm and profession.” related Making a $30 million commitment to address global unemployment “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce Never miss a story"
McKinsey accelerates gen AI value creation with Iguazio,"McKinsey’s Iguazio platform offers enterprises a consolidated, software-based approach to build, implement, scale, and govern gen AI solutions.",2024-06-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-accelerates-gen-ai-value-creation-with-iguazio,"McKinsey accelerates gen AI value creation with Iguazio June 18, 2024 It’s been 18 months since OpenAI launched Chat GPT, immediately unleashing a wave of curiosity and experimentation. This work has paid off; early users understand the balance between generative AI’s (gen AI) benefits and limitations, and the infrastructure and skills required. About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey Yet the short history of gen AI also chronicles countless pilot projects that stalled because they lacked structure and purpose and failed to deliver desired results. Moreover, some implementations of gen AI tools such as chat bots and virtual agents have produced embarrassing—and even dangerous—results. Ambitious leaders are eager to move beyond the “thousand flowers bloom” phase of gen AI. In short, they want to put more science into their data science. Enter Iguazio , a leading AI and machine learning operations company acquired by McKinsey in 2023. Since its acquisition, Iguazio has been integrated into QuantumBlack , McKinsey’s AI arm, dedicated to driving innovation and experimentation in AI. Iguazio offers a software-based AI platform grounded in data science principles to help organizations develop, deploy, and manage gen AI solutions. McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology The platform—part of QuantumBlack Horizon , McKinsey’s suite of AI development tools— addresses enterprises’ two biggest challenges when advancing from gen AI proofs of concept to live implementations within business environments. These are: “Gen AI made it easier to build POCs (proofs of concept), but much harder to move them to production, widening the gap between potential and actual business value,” said Asaf Somekh , co-founder and CEO of Iguazio. “With the Iguazio AI platform, we bridge that gap, helping organizations embed gen AI efficiently into their business processes and applications.” Used separately or as part of McKinsey’s growing catalog of solutions designed to address function- and industry-specific use cases, the underlying architecture of the Iguazio platform facilitates gen AI adoption. For example, the platform promotes the efficient use of infrastructure such as cloud services and computing power by automating many tasks for engineers. Likewise, AI infrastructure components such as Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) can be shared across projects, helping keep costs down and make the most efficient use of resources. Code written to extract data could be converted into managed microservices and reusable components to support a wide range of data extraction processes across the enterprise. McKinsey launches new product suite to help clients scale AI As organizations expand their reliance on Iguazio, additional benefits become apparent, including, for example, the ability to orchestrate and unify the data science process across teams, and centrally integrate and manage data from different sources. The Iguazio AI platform is versatile and can be deployed on-premises and in public, private, and hybrid configurations; includes advanced data lineage, tracking, and privacy features required in highly regulated industries such as financial services and telecommunications; and can be used with a range of large language models. “When McKinsey acquired Iguazio last year, we did it knowing we could quickly integrate its offering into our core QuantumBlack technology to the benefit of enterprises interested in building out robust—and safe—gen AI functionality,” said Ben Ellencweig , a senior partner. “The combination of Iguazio’s platform, McKinsey’s strategy and consulting expertise, and our gen AI ecosystem of tech partners provides the full range of solutions for our clients as they harness the power of gen AI. If 2023 focused on gen AI pilots and experimentation, 2024 is all about production at scale, and Iguazio plays a critical role in achieving that.” To ensure the responsible use of gen AI, the Iguazio platform has built-in guardrails at each stage of development  to help forestall risks such as data breaches, biased results, AI hallucinations, and intellectual property infringements. The platform also supports an effective governance framework. As leaders turn to McKinsey to create measurable and sustained business value from gen AI, they may look back on the early days with a sense of accomplishment at how far they’ve come, even as other companies continue to struggle to get out of the gates. related McKinsey and NVIDIA help industry leaders harness the power of generative AI Never miss a story"

It also discusses our responsible practices—the high professional and ethical standards we use to govern our firm. We understand that without a dedication to responsible practices, our commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth isn’t possible. That’s why, since 2018, we’ve spent nearly $1 billion on building, enhancing, and operating a globally integrated risk, ethics, and compliance framework and culture. Daniel Trujillo , partner and chief ethics and compliance officer based in Austin, Texas, joined our firm in October of 2021 and has 32 years of experience in the field. Here, he describes our approach to operating responsibly and living our values. 2023 ESG Report Why did you choose to come to McKinsey? McKinsey has such a global footprint, and an opportunity to have an impact at that scale is exciting—and rare. I knew I’d be able to make a difference here from my interview process. When our current Global Managing Partner Bob Sternfels mentioned to me how important it was for him to continue improving our approach to ethics, compliance, and risk management, I asked, “Is the firm willing to make sacrifices to continue that journey?” For example, it could require time, shifting focus, or money. The conversations I had with firm leaders showed me that the organization prioritizes ethics and responsible practices. Often, companies have to slow down to get stronger before they can speed up. That’s been the case here, taking time to make changes and new investments—such as doubling our legal team and significantly increasing the size of our risk team. What is your approach to strengthening ethics and compliance? We organize our work into five building blocks that I think of as a wheel to be cycled through. The building blocks are: leadership (ensuring the appropriate resources, tone from the top/middle, accountability, and incentives), risk management (following proper enterprise risk management and annual risk assessments), governance (having clear and accessible rules based on values), training and education, and monitoring and response (to ensure we have a continuous improvement mindset). All of these involve changing human behavior and further enhancing culture—that takes time and perseverance. We work our way through the cycle, learn lessons, and then repeat. After several times around the wheel, the culture has been strengthened. What is your implementation strategy? This work has three pillars: people, process, and technology. We have amazing people at McKinsey, but I learned many years ago that having great people is not enough. More is needed: the right people have to work in tandem with the right processes and the right technology. We need clear, actionable guidelines paired with easy-to-use tools so our people have the seamless support they need. What is an improvement you’ve observed that showed you were on the right track? People come to us asking a simple question before starting client work: what could go wrong? After going through our education and training process, people question what work we should be doing, because not everything is right for us and our values. We want our colleagues to think not only about what we can do but also about what we should do. They’re proactively thinking about scenarios that could challenge how we uphold our values and strategizing if and how to proceed. That’s organizational growth. We want our colleagues to think not only about what we can do but also about what we should do. When you have that level of maturity, of understanding the difference between the can and the should , then you’re better prepared to grow, because you’re leaner and smarter. That’s slowing down so you can speed up. How are you thinking about the future of this work? I’m inspired by the way our firm continues to learn, grow, and improve. Our firm truly understands that there is no finish line for this work, only continuous improvement, which makes me very proud to be here. So, we’re going to keep pressing stop and asking, “What are we missing here? What do we need to do to ensure that we are generating a positive impact?” We aim to build the trust of our clients, colleagues, and society. And we’ll keep going around the “wheel” and earning that trust as we work towards the next hundred years of our firm. related With gen AI, helping green businesses strengthen our ‘blue economy’ McKinsey’s work to bolster HBCUs brings recognition from the White House Never miss a story"

These 20+ products and over 140 use cases combine advanced AI and machine learning techniques with domain-specific expertise to solve today’s most challenging business problems across a spectrum of industries, including Life Sciences, Retail, Mining, and Financial Services. They represent the very latest in AI capabilities and incorporate deep industry expertise, developed from almost a century of serving clients around the world. Our R&D team, QuantumBlack Labs, with 200 software engineers, designers, product managers, and data scientists, has collaborated with over 1000 industry and functional practitioners, to build these AI products. They were developed using our Horizon platform, which incorporates best practices and risk guardrails for security, privacy and resilience. “These products codify knowledge gained through on-the-ground consulting and transformation programs—thousands of projects over eight years. We have infused this insight into the latest AI models, software, and tooling,” says Matt Fitzpatrick , a McKinsey senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack Labs. “Now clients can benefit from deep industry expertise in the form of leading-edge AI models, running on proven technology, along with the change management to ensure that new ways of working are adopted throughout the organization.” These high-impact solutions can help organizations move quickly while building capabilities for long-term success. “We have invested significantly in developing a technology approach that allows these products be deployed in three distinct ways, to whatever our clients need,” says Rory Walsh , a distinguished engineer at QuantumBlack. There are three deployment models available: QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey Metals & Mining Case study: Metals & Mining A major copper concentrate producer was struggling to run grinding mills at their ideal capacity and to achieve top-decile recovery performance. The challenges were driven by the plant’s complex operations, where thousands of sensors were fed into a control system to solve for non-linear functions and trade-offs. QuantumBlack deployed OptimusAI to build an AI model that could use operating data to identify optimization opportunities to boost copper production at consistent quality. As a result, the plant improved throughput by a range of 10 to 15 percent, and copper recovery in a range of two to four percentage points. One of the core assets is OptimusAI, an industry-leading product for optimizing performance to transform plant productivity and decision-making in the production of materials, food, and energy. It incorporates our expertise in process manufacturing and applies cutting-edge machine learning techniques to unlock capacity, reduce emissions, and boost quality, and additionally offers configurable dashboards to improve industrial processes.  A proprietary control-room advisor application was designed to optimize performance in the context of thousands of variables, presenting a straightforward user interface to offer optimization recommendations. “Capturing value from artificial intelligence requires multiple skillsets, and at any point in time, our client engagements require similar toolkits,” says Alexander Sukharevsky , senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack. “With QuantumBlack Labs, we created a center of excellence and learning that codifies domain knowledge into reusable assets that can be deployed into client environments and unlock new scales of impact. Today, this end-to-end AI tech and service stack, including 20+ products across data, infrastructure, tooling and sector-specific use cases, reduces time and cost to develop AI capabilities.” Life Sciences Our core Life Sciences product leverages AI and analytics to serve leading pharma and medtech clients. As new types of clinical and scientific datasets have become available, along with new generative and predictive models, and ever greater computing power to run them, the product has changed the research paradigm by embedding scientific AI into all the core processes. AI is a powerful lever to transform how Life Sciences can improve the probability of success and increase productivity. QuantumBlack’s AI-powered transformations unlock order-of-magnitude acceleration in research and improved drug candidate efficiency, enabling new molecule entry into the clinic within 6 months of deploying our machine learning model for molecule design. Our goal is to accelerate the drug development timeline by one to two years, from discovering endpoints to gaining approval.  QuantumBlack’s AI products are steered from within by practitioners with expertise in data science and deep domain knowledge of biological and clinical science. “We recruit PhDs, doctors and practitioners in medicine who have been on the ground with patients and know the IT systems. They understand the nuances of data capture and of patient journeys,” explains Bhavik Shah , a McKinsey partner. “On the biological side, we have people who've generated and worked with the raw data in the lab and, so they know the value and the limitations which is really important in understanding the biases and gaps.” Insurance QuantumBlack’s work in insurance steers the delivery of AI use cases into transformation projects using reusable code components and use cases, built to production-grade standards for easier scaling. Client teams benefit through accelerated timelines, with pilots deployed in just a few weeks that deliver greater impact, through codified best practices and know how. Case study: Insurance A leading global insurer sought to fundamentally reimagine claims processing in a competitive European market. QuantumBlack’s technologists, along with input from our insurance experts, deployed use cases to augment intelligent decision-making across the claims value chain. The insurer was able to establish new analytics capabilities, building a series of reusable data assets by consolidating internal and external data and establishing additional safeguards around the deployment of AI-related risk and fairness standards. In one aspect of claims management, the time spent on processing claims was reduced by up to 50 percent through use of an AI agent to guide claims handlers in call triage and onward processing. “We have been tirelessly iterating on the technical foundations of our industry solutions, which can create impact and transform any business, in any industry. Today is an exciting moment in the firm’s history,” says Matt. “We will always be a management consulting firm, but we’re also a technology company.” To learn more about what QuantumBlack’s AI products can do for your enterprise and to request a demo, please e-mail Marc Solomon .  You can subscribe to the New at McKinsey blog for updates to QuantumBlack Labs. related McKinsey’s ecosystem of strategic alliances brings the power of generative AI to clients McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology Never miss a story"
Looking to improve productivity? Think small.,"In this new report, McKinsey Global Institute highlights the role of small business in raising overall productivity.",2024-06-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/looking%20to%20improve%20productivity%20think%20small/mgismallbiz-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,McKinsey Global Institute,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/looking-to-improve-productivity-think-small,"Looking to improve productivity? Think small. June 26, 2024 For many people, small business is a part of their everyday life: the corner bodega, the dog walker, the food truck, the plumber. In the US, people trust small businesses more than any other institution. “They are the one thing, literally, that we interact with every single day, and they make a big difference to the lives of people,” explains Anu Madgavkar , an MGI partner. This week, as the United Nations marks Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day on June 27 , we look at the McKinsey Global Institute’s (MGI) first-time report on this small, but mighty, business sector. Our analysis ranges from sole proprietors to mid-size companies of 200+ employees. It goes broad, spanning 16 countries, and deep, covering 200 plus subsectors. In this post, Anu, Kanmani “KC” Chockalingam , an MGI fellow, and María Jesús Ramírez Larraín , a McKinsey associate partner, share what they learned from their research. What prompted MGI to focus on this sector now? Anu :  Productivity, for us, is an important research theme and small businesses are a powerful force.  They account for more than 90 percent of all businesses, roughly half of the global GDP, and more than two-thirds of business employment. They form the backbone of many economies. But micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) are only half as productive as large companies, and even less so in emerging economies. If we can raise their productivity to top-quartile levels relative to large companies, that is equal to 5 percent of GDP in advanced economies and 10 percent in emerging economies. They have an important role to play in long term prosperity, resilience, and growth. You can't really lift productivity systematically unless you take the MSME sector with you. A microscope on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to boost productivity What was your key takeaway from the findings? María : For me, a very powerful idea is the fact that creating and increasing these linkages between small and large companies is actually a win-win situation. A lot of large companies would think about it as a bit of a philanthropic act: “You're doing it from the goodness of your heart.”  But actually no. There's a true business case for working with smaller companies.  You reduce the risk in your supply chain; small companies have local insight and resources; greater flexibility; and access to certain skills.  That's incredibly powerful. KC : The granularity of the data allowed us to see the incredible complexity of the MSME sector across countries you would think are similar. It also highlighted opportunities to improve productivity. For example, in Mexico, the sector is about food products, whereas in Brazil, it's chemicals; in India, the information and communications sector (ICT) could potentially drive up productivity, whereas in Indonesia, it's construction. With such a complicated landscape, is there a universal formula to lift productivity? Anu : More than a set formula, there are universal principles. One of them is to think about: which intangible is really the critical one? Is it capital? Is it technology?  Skills? Access to global markets? Because each business is quite different in terms of these things. The second is really being thoughtful about the power of those networks. Because almost nowhere is it the case that small businesses can flourish without very meaningful relationships with productive larger businesses. Sometimes they are highly functioning as collectives of small businesses: that is, with each other. But often, they are interacting with a larger company, as a consumer or a buyer. But understanding those kinds of networks is, I think, the most powerful idea that came from this research. What actions can leaders take to “lift up” the small business sector? María : From the perspective of associations, policymakers and large companies, there's a lot you can do. It's basically a combination of better access to the intangibles Anu talked about. Leaders should focus on creating the “economic fabric” where both MSMEs and large companies can perform well. For example, in Japan, large automakers have a history of tight integration with smaller suppliers, and very much live by the credo “we're in this together. ” It provides them with access to talent, operational efficiencies, and leading-edge technology. They are intertwined, and highly productive together. KC : We found a number of these win-win examples, each with a different formula. The Italian government provides its winemakers, generally smaller family-owned enterprises, with centralized branding and marketing resources for access to the international market. They can command premium prices, and a highly networked industry association gives them a powerful voice. In Australia, the government has fostered a high rate of public and private partnerships between small and large companies in specialized construction, especially mining. This enables them to be highly productive in a remote, harsh environment—they’ve streamlined red tape, and provide strong vocational training. Do small businesses stay small forever? Anu :  Some do, yes…but when we looked at the data over a 15-year period we found that almost 19 percent of all the largest companies actually started as small businesses. So this gives us a sense of how things evolve. The other trend which is really important is that at some point, less-productive firms will exit. Small businesses that are uncompetitive will down their shutters, or merge with others. But large businesses exit at a healthy rate, too–and that opens up opportunities for the newer, more productive, small businesses, right? related A new McKinsey look at the role of productivity in sustainable growth Inside a new blueprint for accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth Never miss a story"

AIDS was still a huge question at the time and the corporate world was also absorbing the challenge of equal benefits and, eventually, equal marriage ,” recalls Brian Rolfes , a former partner at McKinsey who recently retired after nearly 30 years of serving clients and leading talent and diversity initiatives. “The silver lining was that we had this great community, including our families and allies, step up and say, ‘No, no, this has to change…' We were seeing that desire for change and activism surface in corporate life. And we learned we could broaden this to other regions around the world.” The network was first called the Gay and Lesbian Interest Group or GLIG. “Someone in the group sent out a note saying, “This is ridiculous. We should be a little bit more fabulous than GLIG… so we became GLAM,” laughs Brian. “We obviously needed to be more inclusive of all of our LGBQ and trans colleagues, which is why we have adopted Equal at McKinsey .” Over the next 25 years, Equal at McKinsey's early mission of support expanded to include recruiting, mentorship, global conferences, learning programs, pro bono work, and research initiatives.

While many leadership books highlight external capabilities, this title looks inward…to the psychological traits required to lead in a turbulent, increasingly complex world. The CEOs of the 2,000 largest organizations alone employ 70 million people. In a global survey, 83% of them said they felt unprepared for the job. Many are leaving sooner: the average CEO tenure has shrunk from six years to five. The Journey of Leadership aims to codify some of the internal processes and psychological and emotional growth necessary to achieve success as an individual and as a leader. The Journey of Leadership The book offers examples of a CEO who learns how to trust; one who makes mistakes and has to live with them; another who overcomes her feelings of being an “imposter.” Many of these stories have been shared by participants of our own Bower Forum , McKinsey's longest-running leadership development program. “We've been counseling CEOs, helping them become fully realized for over a decade through this program. We help CEOs crystallize their mandates, reflect on key challenges, and work with peers on a few ideas that can effectively address these challenges,” observes Ramesh Srinivasan , a McKinsey senior partner who along with Hans-Werner Kaas , senior partner emeritus, is a co-dean of the Bower Forum. Each forum is small, a group of about ten people from very diverse backgrounds. Three to four are active CEOs, along with their McKinsey partners, and the faculty is comprised of a McKinsey senior partner and one or two former CEOs/Chairs. “There are no slides, no tracking, no data; the agenda is determined by the participants,” explains Santiago Raymond , who has managed the program for a decade. About 20 in-person workshops take place around the world every year. More than 520 leaders have participated in some 145 Bower Forums to date. Unlike many programs which assemble groups of similar attendees, it draws from different industries, geographies, and tenures, which helps to create a sense of anonymity in the room and richness of perspectives. “This allows people to speak more candidly,” says Santiago. “But the idea is that the participants are peers, so they understand what the life is like; the sacrifices they make; the demands on time; the stresses of conflict and crises. They know the impact it can have on them, their families, friends, and society.” The two-day meeting starts with getting to know each other, their context, and the topics they want to bring to the table, along with their McKinsey partner. The faculty then share their own experiences: their North Star, their legacies, what they wish they had known or would have done differently. The agenda includes a deep immersion module when the participants are in listening-and-reflection mode, and their reinvention starts based on feedback they have received. Some participants develop plans with specific commitments on how they will lead themselves, their executive teams, and broader organizations, a tangible outcome of the Forum. The only training for being a CEO is being a CEO. “A lot of times, the discussions tend to be around relationships: with the team, with the environment, with the board, the organization. It’s a combination of self-discovery and hearing different perspectives,” says Ramesh. “But at the end, the participating CEOs choose the topics, changing from program to program .” The Journey of Leadership includes the story of the CEO of an Asian tech giant who attended the Bower Forum and realized that he needed guidance in managing a complicated, somewhat rivalrous relationship with his chairman, also his mentor. It was impeding him from undertaking significant changes to the company. After much self-assessment, he became more open and humble, and recognized he needed to become a better listener. He sought input from his management team, outsiders, and the board. He had been trying to go it alone, but after feedback from the other CEOs, he realized that he is not always expected to be ‘the smartest one in the room. ’ This gave him permission to ask for help. Some CEOs experience the imposter syndrome, feeling they don't belong because they lack a certain expertise or background. At the Bower Forum, one executive learned that he had to move beyond his internal, personal insecurities and focus outwardly on his goals for a bold transformation, starting with assembling the right team. It ’ s the kind of message that resonated when he heard it from his own peers. “The only training for being a CEO is being a CEO,” observed Marvin Bower, McKinsey’s longest-serving global managing partner, who alongside James O. McKinsey defined the foundations of the firm in the twentieth century. “What we are saying then is here is a program where we're going to share our own experiences and insights,” observes Hans-Werner, “to become better leaders and human beings, making a significant step towards reinventing ourselves.” related One book.

The McKinsey partners putting middle managers at the center of organizational excellence,"It&rsquo;s been one year since our book, Power to the Middle, has been published. Find out how leaders have been reinventing this critical role.",2024-08-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/power%20to%20the%20middle%20one%20year%20later/middlemanager-hero-small-book-1536x864.jpg,"Our Publishing,Organization,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/power-to-the-middle-one-year-later,"The McKinsey partners putting middle managers at the center of organizational excellence August 1, 2024 When you ask someone about their career goals, they may say, “I want to be a school principal” or “store manager” or “leading the team discovering a cure for a devastating disease.” “But they probably aren’t going to say ‘I want to be a middle manager,’” laughs Bryan Hancock , a McKinsey partner. “Yet, these are all middle management positions.” A year ago, McKinsey published Power to the Middle , a book exploring how this under-rated role has become top of mind for leaders whose companies have experienced high rates of burnout, leaves of absence, and attrition in the aftermath of the pandemic. “Businesses are realizing that investing in their middle management is not just a nice-to-have; it is a business imperative,” observes Emily Field , a McKinsey partner, who along with Bryan and Bill Schaninger , a former McKinsey partner, co-authored the book. We talked to Bryan and Emily about how this pivotal organizational role has been changing over the past year. We are well-known advisors to the C-suite. How have we also been working with companies to rethink middle manager roles? Emily: The companies that are doing this right—and we’re getting to help them—are thinking about it not as, “We need to send our managers to training,” but actually, “We need to rethink our manager operating system.” They are asking questions like: how do we first create space so our managers have time to think critically, to focus on developing their own skills, and to coach their teams? What administrative work can we eliminate? What technologies can we use to automate some of the work? How do we build resiliency habits? Let’s face it: a manager’s job is incredibly hard: their spans are becoming larger, the personnel situations they have to navigate are more complicated, and they’re having to execute and deliver on business objectives in constrained environments as organizations cut costs. Power to the Middle What does an effective manager look like today? Bryan: Managers need to be able to do four things particularly well. They need to connect what the team is being asked to do to the broader “why.” This “sense-making” aspect is incredibly important. They empower their people: give them the context, guidance, and the confidence to do their job, and not micro-manage. At the same time, they challenge their team members to meet a high standard of performance—and to do more than they thought possible. A great manager is an inspiring, honest, and empathic coach—and not just a process-oriented taskmaster. They need to be able to build productive collaboration within and across teams—including fostering connectivity across many different forms of colleagues, including those working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and gig workers. They need to connect with divisions across the company, such as tech and support functions. They also need to understand the whole person—including the career and outside-of-work priorities of their team members—and provide empathetic and honest counsel on how to balance competing priorities. They need to recognize team members who may be struggling and guide them to supports which may be available. How has gen AI been re-shaping this role? Emily: We are seeing companies starting to use AI to improve their managers’ skills while they are in the flow of work. One organization is building in an AI-bot system of nudges to help their people better manage their work/life balance. For example, it asks ‘can you combine these meetings to be home on time?’ The same approach is being used to develop resilience: to guide teams to pause and take moment to re-calibrate their reactions to moments of stress such as a customer service crisis, or a tightened deadline, instances which will be a constant in their work life. Bryan: In addition to improving skills, gen AI is giving time back to managers. It is helping managers more rapidly complete the first drafts of their individual contributor work; alleviating administrative burdens, such as auto-filling required HR forms; and helping manage meetings and email via copilots which can summarize meetings and email threads and highlight areas for action. Gen AI-enabled tools are freeing managers to spend more time coaching team members, building relationships, and thinking critically about the most important problems. Where do you see middle management roles in two years? Emily: My hope would be that people can say proudly: “I am a middle manager because that’s a great place to be; I’m able to have impact, I have the space in my day to develop my people, which is was what gives me energy, and that is why I do my job.” And, if not, that’s okay. Companies are recognizing that not everyone wants to be a manager, and it shouldn’t be the only track for advancement. Companies are creating dual tracks: one for managers, one for knowledge experts. You don’t have to become a manager to advance; you can just be really good at what you do. Your expertise is your source of renewal and growth. And this dual-track approach can create an organization that is able to execute and thrive. related New McKinsey book explores how CEOs learn to lead Generative AI can give you “superpowers,” new McKinsey research finds"

McKinsey program supporting return from leave recognized by WEF,"McKinsey&rsquo;s unique reboarding program has been successful in lowering attrition rates for those taking leave, the majority of whom are new mothers.",2024-02-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20firm%20has%20my%20back%20mckinsey%20program%20supporting%20return%20from%20leave%20named%20a%20lighthouse%20by%20wef/reboarding-hero-small-kristina-1536x864.jpg,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-program-supporting-return-from-leave-named-a-lighthouse-by-wef,"McKinsey program supporting return from leave recognized by WEF Kristina Müller with her son, Lukas. February 7, 2024 María del Mar Martinez, chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer at McKinsey, had three children during her time at the firm, the first as an associate partner and the second and third as partner. While they were joyous times in her life, they also raised professional challenges. “Those years were some of my toughest at the firm,” says María. “Re-engaging was always somewhat of a shock.” María helped lead an effort at the firm to support new parents, and others taking more than 12 weeks of leave, aimed at reducing attrition rates and improving their overall experience at work. The reboarding program launched in 2019 in Europe as a two-year pilot and reduced attrition by 20 percent, drawing over 1,100 participants. In 2023, the program expanded to all McKinsey offices. With this program, María sees a paradigm shift at the firm from her early motherhood days. “McKinsey is a place for having kids and a successful career.  Our reboarding program brings parents back from leave into a supportive, thriving environment,” she says. The program was recently recognized by the World Economic Forum as a diversity, equity and inclusion 'Lighthouse' in 2023, part of a broader effort to recognize companies’ DEI initiatives that McKinsey helped launch in 2022 . Germany-based McKinsey associate partner Kristina Müller recently used the program and shares her experience with its five components. McKinsey is a place for having kids and a successful career. A customized reintegration plan Kristina: I was on leave for 10 months after having my first child, Lukas. I was uneasy about being gone for that long and what I’d face when I returned. But this changed when the firm helped me form a plan for reboarding before I went on leave. I determined I wanted to return part time at 70 percent, and I connected with mentors and sponsors to talk this through. These same people were there to guide my reintegration. Individual parental coaching Kristina: The firm provided an incredible parental coach. It was someone external, which made me very comfortable speaking about all my fears and challenges, but the coach also had counseled others in the firm and knew how it worked. I had conversations with her every few weeks to discuss what was on my plate, tips about working part time, about prioritizing, and about being a mom in this challenging environment. She helped me determine my support system and how I’d coordinate care and manage my time. Facilitating the return In general, I felt like the firm would help me with whatever I might need. Kristina: The first step to coming back is getting staffed on a project. Being gone shrinks your network, and I was part time which could make things complicated for a team. To solve for this, the firm offered extra staffing for teams I joined, a resource available for six months. Adding a person to the team helped me focus on my baby and made me feel cared for. My incredible colleagues were what I missed most when I was on leave, and they were there for me when I returned. Specially calibrated performance evaluations Kristina: When I took leave, I was an engagement manager, but not long after I returned, I was promoted to associate partner, even while working at 70 percent. It was very helpful to know that in my first performance review upon return would be conducted with the leave in mind, offering helpful feedback but not letting my new situation be a factor in my performance rating. This removed a huge potential stressor. World-class broader parental supports Kristina: The firm was proactive and reached out to me to remind me childcare reimbursement was available. Using it was a very simple process. There are always times when your system fails, someone gets sick, the daycare might close, really anything can throw it off. There was also an allowance of days I could access emergency childcare, such as hiring a babysitter, if I needed a short-term solution. It was great to know it was there. In general, I felt like the firm would help me with whatever I might need.  Early on in my return, I had a Zoom call, and I didn’t have childcare.  I had my baby on my chest and I was bouncing him gently so he wouldn’t wake up. I tried to tilt the camera high so participants couldn’t see him. I felt uneasy at first. But I made it through because I knew the firm has my back. It’s all good—I’m a working mom. related McKinsey’s new parental leave program supports inclusive career advancement Never miss a story"
McKinsey&rsquo;s work to bolster HBCUs brings recognition from the White House,McKinsey&rsquo;s work with HBCU Delaware State University led to pro bono support of the President&rsquo;s Board of Advisors&mdash;recognized by the President and Vice President.,2024-02-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/i%20never%20expected%20us%20to%20receive%20an%20award%20from%20the%20white%20house/mckinsey_hbcu_whitehouse_hero_1536x864px.jpg,"Diversity,Education",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinseys-work-to-bolster-hbcus-brings-recognition-from-the-white-house,"McKinsey’s work to bolster HBCUs brings recognition from the White House From left to right: partner Ryan Golden with chair of the President’s Board of Advisors Dr. Tony Allen and vice chair Dr. Glenda Glover. February 26, 2024 When McKinsey partner Ryan Golden began working to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), she never thought that three years later, she’d win an award from the White House and meet with President Joseph R. Biden. “When we first started this work, I knew that it had a lot of potential to be high impact,” says the Atlanta-based partner . “But I never expected this recognition from the White House.” Established in the 19th century to provide educational opportunities for African American students who were denied access to other institutions, HBCUs have remained critical platforms for the education and advancement of students of color ever since. McKinsey served HBCUs in the wake of COVID-19 to support their operations, which led to  a major opportunity: working with the President’s Board of Advisors (PBA) on HBCUs on a pro bono basis. Below, Ryan shares a debrief from her trip to the White House, what led to meeting the President, and the award. What is your area of focus at McKinsey? I’m a partner in our public, social and healthcare practices . My client work focuses on supporting universities and other educational organizations to improve student outcomes, which means partnering with these institutions to help them increase graduation and retention rates, grow student enrollment, and become financially sustainable. McKinsey's work on the PBA’s first report to the President has been immeasurable and will be central to what we believe are excellent recommendations. What is the special role of HBCUs? HBCUs are mission-driven institutions with a proud history and a rich legacy of achievement. They confer 17 percent of all bachelor’s degrees awarded to Black students in the United States, driving economic mobility for its graduates who often move into higher-income quintiles post-graduation. HBCUs are also key to developing talent and have educated prominent and esteemed scholars, business leaders, entertainers, and public servants, graduating 40 percent of all Black engineers; 40 percent of all Black US Congress members; 50 percent of all Black lawyers; and 80 percent of all Black judges. Tell us about the firm’s work with HBCUs. We began serving HBCUs in 2020 in the wake of COVID to bolster their financial stability and critical operations in the early days of the pandemic. This led to a partnership between the United Negro College Fund, Thurgood Marshall College Fund, the Partnership for Education Advancement, and McKinsey. Together, we launched a project to systematically improve and share best practices across the HBCU network of over 100 institutions. How did the invitation to the White House come about? We worked with Delaware State University (DSU) on their strategic growth aspirations, including supporting them as they became the first HBCU to acquire another institution. DSU President Dr. Tony Allen was later appointed the chair of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs. Dr. Allen brought us into a partnership with the PBA to help accelerate their efforts to advance educational equity and economic opportunity for the nation’s HBCU students. Our firm committed to support the PBA pro-bono—an example of McKinsey’s unwavering dedication towards racial equity . Through the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility , we developed a fact base and view on trends in the higher education sector. This helped the PBA develop a key recommendation to the President on how to best accelerate HBCUs on a trajectory of resiliency and long-term sustainable growth. As a result of this pro bono work, we were awarded the Vista Prize for Public Leadership, with Dr. Allen noting: “McKinsey's work on the PBA's first report to the President has been immeasurable and will be central to what we believe are excellent recommendations.  To have your expertise by our side was a tremendous lift to our efforts.” Dr. Allen asked that I join the PBA for the discussion at the White House —a true testament to the credibility we’ve built in this space and our investment in meaningful client relationships. How was the experience of meeting the President and Vice-President? In the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, our group met with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, and the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Tanden commended our research on the linkage between education and Black economic mobility. The dialogue with the President and Vice President was equally substantive and included recognition for the research and work underpinning the PBA’s recommendations. At the meeting’s mid-point, the press were allowed in and cameras began rolling . During his remarks, Dr. Allen mentioned the Board’s partnership with our firm, the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility and the quality of our work. I know that he really values our partnership, but I did not expect him to say that in that moment, sitting next to the President, on such a public stage. After the meeting, I had the opportunity to individually meet with both the President and Vice President—dialogue and exchanges that I will never forget. Later that evening, I received the Vista Prize with colleagues Charag Krishnan, Christopher Copeland, Ian Jefferson, Fiyin Oladiran, Ian Jefferson and Nora Gardner at a formal award ceremony. It was a true “McKinsey-only” moment, an unforgettable experience that inspired me and the team to keep working for transformative outcomes. related Creating an ‘ecosystem’ to close the Black talent gap in technology ‘Spotlight’ on board diversity: McKinsey and Goldman Sachs move the needle Never miss a story"
McKinsey launches an open-source ecosystem for digital and AI projects,"In addition to the open-source ecosystem, two enhancements to the Horizon suite of tools for AI development and implementation have also launched.",2023-09-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20launches%20an%20open-source%20ecosystem/open-source-hero-13-1536x864.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-launches-an-open-source-ecosystem,"McKinsey launches an open-source ecosystem for digital and AI projects McKinsey colleagues Stephanie Kaiser, senior designer; Rashida Kanchwala, senior software engineer; and Ankita Katiyar, software engineer. September 26, 2023 Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of a McKinsey open-source ecosystem that will host products from across the firm, including some of our leading-edge technologies and IP in AI including generative AI, digital, and cloud. The first major release in our collection is Vizro, a new component from our QuantumBlack Horizon suite, which helps users visualize data from their AI models. In addition to Vizro, the new ecosystem will host CausalNex , a tool for building cause-and-effect models that has been available to the public since 2020 through QuantumBlack Labs’ GitHub organization. “Open source has become a foundational element of how we deliver organizational transformation for our clients globally, because it enables technologists to adapt our methodologies and toolkits to meet their distinct needs,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky , a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey . “It is also our way to contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth and narrow the digital divide.” The open-source ecosystem can be accessed at GitHub . This milestone builds on our open-source momentum. In 2022 we released Kedro , a Python toolbox that streamlines the creation of machine-learning pipelines, to the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data incubator so it could evolve as an open standard. Early this year, we acquired Iguazio , whose open-source projects Nuclio and MLRun are integral to their strategy. “We are on a journey to be known for our technology capabilities as much as our strategic advice,” says Rodney Zemmel , a senior partner and global leader of McKinsey Digital. “This new ecosystem illustrates the firm’s belief and investment in open-source standards and gives all of our 6000+ technologists the opportunity to contribute their expertise and help clients gain the most value from their technology investments.” …this new ecosystem illustrates the firm’s belief and investment in open source standards and gives all of our 6000+ technologists the opportunity to contribute their expertise… Many businesses are struggling to scale their AI projects. In a recent survey , only 3 percent of companies have embedded AI in at least five business functions. Organizations are finding it takes as long to develop the 15th model as it did the first. Generative AI use cases, which have grown exponentially, are especially challenging due to the complexity of managing very large datasets and models. Our Horizon suite, announced in June, helps clients overcome these challenges and reduces the time it takes to realize value from their AI portfolios. It establishes a factory-like approach to delivering accurate data across all sources; building and monitoring scalable, integrated models; and ensuring transparency for quick, reliable decision making. Vizro, a tool that visualizes AI model data Vizro , the newest Horizon component, creates high-quality visualizations that allows users to better explore and analyze data from their models. In a matter of hours rather than weeks, teams can collaborate to define insights and present them to clients in live workshops or demos. Before Vizro, building dashboards required much longer timeframes, and often meant securing additional, scarce, front-end engineering or design talent. “What once required thousands of lines of code and extra staff to build, now can be accomplished in a day,” explains Joe Perkins , the product manager who led the ten-person team developing the tool. Vizro components are plug-and-play to maximize flexibility and scaling. A high level of visual design, code and data quality, and best practices are built into the tool, which also integrates industry and functional knowledge and leverages the power of open-source tools such as Plotly and Dash. “This accelerates the creation process and provides consistency and a high quality of output,” Joe says. “It all goes to increasing the client's understanding and trust in the data and insights.” Generative AI: Capturing the opportunity Horizon command center helps you understand ROI on data & AI initiatives In addition to Vizro, the Horizon suite has been enhanced with a new “command center” functionality for AI initiatives. It helps technology leaders see the status, adoption, and impact of their overall AI projects down to the individual use case, as measured by relevant business KPIs. The tool will help leaders analyze the health and productivity of an organization’s AI implementation, to flag roadblocks and opportunities for scaling. “Often organizations don’t know exactly how many use cases they are running because they are dispersed across the divisions, let alone how productive they are,” explains Matt Fitzpatrick , a senior partner and leader of QuantumBlack Labs. “With our command center, leaders can scan the landscape of their AI implementations and understand their value in terms that are meaningful to them, such as adoption status and ROI.” “The pace of AI development, in particular, has been stunning, and capturing and applying these new capabilities is extremely complex,” says Alex Singla , a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. “It can only be done through the intense collaboration and accelerated learning that comes from working within the open-source community.” Going forward, Horizon will become our firm’s platform for incubating, supporting, promoting and ultimately open sourcing more tools. Of the eleven Horizon components today, four are already available: Kedro and Vizro from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and MLRun and Nuclio from Iguazio.

Women with darker skin tones would now no longer have to blend foundations themselves. This prestigious international brand allowed Black women to finally have the glamourous, more equitable department store shopping experience they deserved. “The elegant ladies behind the counters at department stores, all Black and dressed to the nines... Young ladies going with their mothers to buy makeup for their first prom or dinner dance... That’s the legacy of Fashion Fair, and it’s part of our history,” says Desiree Rogers, now co-owner of Fashion Fair. To keep this legacy alive, Desiree rebooted the iconic brand in 2019 , due in part to the much larger market availability today for beauty products aimed at people with more melanated skin tones. Despite the progress in the beauty industry since Fashion Fair’s groundbreaking launch, there is still a long way to go to achieve equity . Today, Black cosmetics brands make up only 2.5 percent of revenue in the beauty industry, even though Black consumers are responsible for over 11 percent of total beauty spending, and Black consumers have reported high rates of dissatisfaction with many of the current beauty products available to them. Black beauty brands account for a maximum of seven percent of brands carried by most stores, but Black people are still underrepresented within the industry and founders raise capital at lower rates than non-Black brands. To help move toward a more equitable market, McKinsey has conducted research and identified solutions, convened Black beauty founders , supported the 15 Percent Pledge to increase representation in stores , and helped develop founders through our Next 1B program , part of our 10 actions toward racial equity . Desiree and McKinsey senior partner Tiffany Burns explain more about McKinsey’s efforts, the industry, and how Black beauty founders are making their mark. Why is McKinsey focusing on beauty founders in particular? Tiffany: Black beauty consumers are growing in their spending, but at the same time, their needs aren’t being fully met. It’s a lost economic opportunity for real growth. Even as Black beauty brands offer amazing new products, a constellation of issues, including underinvestment in new brands and not enough representation on retail shelves, holds them back. It’s a problem that presents a lot of opportunity, but requires convening multiple partners to solve—a natural role for us to get involved. What is McKinsey’s approach to promoting Black beauty founders? Tiffany: We’re working on four fronts: research, convenings, supporting emerging founders, and working with retailers on expanding representation. Our research helps make the economic case and the convenings create a community of founders to offer mutual support and solutions. Our Next 1B program is a 12-week institute that offers skill building for entrepreneurs, and our work with the 15 Percent Pledge was focused on its strategy to scale in a sustainable way, to make sure it has pledges from the right blend of retailers so Black brands will show up in a variety of stores—department stores, drug stores, cosmetic stores, and more. What has been the impact of McKinsey’s work? Desiree: I’ve been involved with McKinsey’s convenings and really felt the community support. It makes such a difference to know there’s other founders to bounce ideas off who face similar challenges. And out in the industry, I always make sure the retailers we deal with—Walmart, CVS, Ulta, Target, Sephora and more—have McKinsey’s research and refer them to McKinsey with any questions. Retailers have told me how McKinsey’s work has changed how minority audiences will be presented in stores moving forward—they’re not to be ignored. That is huge. Retailers have told me how McKinsey’s work has changed how minority audiences will be presented in stores moving forward—they’re not to be ignored. That is huge. It’s phenomenal to see the change, and to see the excitement on the part of the retailer. What motivates you to tackle this issue? Tiffany: I worked in retail before coming to the firm, so I’ve dug into this issue. As a Black beauty consumer myself, I’ve seen the full spectrum of challenges and opportunities. Making progress here benefits so many people. Desiree: When you invest in companies that are minority owned, it’s likely that money will support their communities in terms of who the company hires and its philanthropic giving. I believe together we can hold hands and create some real scale among companies that are owned by minorities in this country—and we’ve got to have that. related “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce New tech accelerator propels underrepresented founders to success Never miss a story"
New tech accelerator propels underrepresented founders to success,"Founders of tech startups who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ still face considerable hurdles. These founders are accelerating success through a new McKinsey platform for inclusive growth.",2023-02-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20nyc%20tech%20accelerator%20propels%20underrepresented%20founders%20to%20success/innyc-hero-small-3people-1536x864-v2.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-nyc-tech-accelerator-propels-underrepresented-founders-to-success,"New tech accelerator propels underrepresented founders to success Isabel Rafferty Zavala, Lisa Skeete Tatum, and Tanya Van Court February 3, 2023 When Isabel Rafferty Zavala began working with McKinsey on growing her start-up, she was a little anxious. She had a lot at stake as founder and CEO of Canela Media, a streaming platform for Hispanic and Latino audiences. While she had started other companies, she knew this one would be a much bigger undertaking—and risk—one she took on with her husband, Michael Rafferty, COO of Canela. “I told Michael, ‘Are you up for this? If we fail, we’ll be sleeping at our parents’ places with our four kids,’” she says with a laugh. Founded in 2019, Canela was one of few minority- and women-owned companies to secure venture-capital funding to help it grow. Following its series-A financing, Canela experienced whirlwind growth that’s been difficult to keep up with. That’s what attracted Isabel to McKinsey’s InNYC accelerator , a pro bono program that provides a suite of firm resources to New York City tech start-up founders from underrepresented groups. The program takes an expansive view of the underrepresented community to include, socio-economic status, first generation college students, LGBTQ+ people, and women. It is focused on bringing together start-ups with inspiring concepts that have faced systemic barriers and opportunity gaps in the past. Initially, Isabel was hesitant to place her baby in unfamiliar hands. “I thought, ‘Let’s see,’” she says, “but McKinsey earned our trust quickly. I felt at peace for the first time in a while because I had more clarity about our future.” Economies are stronger when growth opportunities are created for everyone, yet women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ business founders continue to face barriers, such as lack of funding and access to professional networks. These founders push forward, often without support, shouldering considerable emotional, operational, and financial burdens. InNYC, a program out of McKinsey’s New York office, aims to accelerate inclusive innovation in technology. To bring the tech start-up playing field closer to level, the New York office hosted its inaugural InNYC “cohort pitch day,” where nine finalists presented tech platforms poised to make a difference in their communities. From there, three start-ups—all founded by women of color—went on to receive 12 weeks of dedicated firm resources: Canela , the Hispanic and Latino streaming platform, Goalsetter , a family-oriented savings, investing, and financial education app, and Landit , a career-development platform aimed at increasing diversity. Parvathy Menon , an engagement manager who led McKinsey’s work with the start-ups, says that despite the innovative products and successes, the founders have had trouble securing corporate sponsorships, making deals, building networks, and more. “It truly showed how much factors like race and gender skew the playing field in a way that is hard to comprehend on a daily basis,” she says. “So not only did we work on a wide variety of business challenges, but we were there with them through real emotional highs and lows.” Focusing on long-term growth Canela launched not long before the pandemic—a turbulent time for a streaming platform, when viewership spiked, but advertisers were hesitant to spend. Despite these challenges, in the blink of an eye, Isabel and Michael went from being hands on in the work to growing their departments and figuring out HR onboarding; from just nine employees to 110. “With fast growing companies, you don’t have time to sit back and analyze the business, and you start to get separated from the baseline work,” says Michael. Working with McKinsey, they codified an onboarding process to ease growing pains in the short term, refined the equity story for the medium term, and performed an IPO readiness assessment and five-year charting for the long term. “They organized our brains,” says Isabel. Lisa Skeete Tatum, Founder and CEO of Landit, a personalized coaching and career pathing platform to increase the success of women and diverse groups, came into the program with massive opportunity in front of her—and wanted McKinsey to help her seize it. Having secured contracts with Fortune 50 companies, global HR companies and smaller organizations, she needed playbooks for scaling. “As a start-up we were trying to figure out how to successfully navigate and meet the major demand we were experiencing,” Lisa says. “How do we do that and not drown in the process?” She found that in her short three months in the program, everything changed. She gained quick access to experts who created expansion levers such as pricing; identified customers’ future needs for the changing workplace through case studies; strengthened the impact of her communication with customers through increased clarity of her business impact; and accelerated her team’s work by bringing them all in for strategy sessions. “Connecting the dots of the opportunity we’d built for ourselves with McKinsey’s global experience—that was invaluable. It was company making,” says Lisa. As a Black woman founder, the deck is stacked against you. McKinsey brought a few more cards my way in a short period of time. It was liberating. Learning from the founders Tanya Van Court, CEO and Founder of Goalsetter, the financial literacy app for children, says that her experience in the accelerator led her to break through longstanding challenges quickly and make major decisions, such as pursuing growth through bank and school partnerships rather than as an employee benefit. Brian Clement , a McKinsey associate, worked with Tanya throughout her 12-week engagement and says it was unlike any other experience at the firm, largely due to Tanya’s dedication and one-woman scrappiness. The juxtaposition of sky-high possibilities and existential crises made for a roller-coaster experience, pushing Brian to find solutions he’d never had to before. He credits Tanya with the success. “I was extremely impressed,” says Brian. “I’d never seen one person balance so much while setting such a positive tone for her staff.” Working with her also exposed Brian, a White man, to the experiences and difficulties being a Black woman founder faced. “There were many emotional ups and downs, and Tanya was so generous in talking about her experience with race and gender as a founder,” he says. “I learned a lot.” Spreading that awareness and building on it might have been most important to Tanya. “As a Black woman founder, the deck is stacked against you. McKinsey brought a few more cards my way in a short period of time,” says Tanya. “It was liberating.” The success of the inaugural cohort has Parvathy and others hard at work on refining the program— 2023 program applications are open now . “There’s been so many great learnings,” says Parvathy. “We're going to be even more impactful now.” related At Slush event, McKinsey shows how startups can become unicorns Fifteen unicorns founded by McKinsey alums may be shaping your world Never miss a story"

The economic implications, especially for developing countries, are significant. Research shows that increased connectivity can boost a wide range of industries, from retail and healthcare to manufacturing and oil and gas and add trillions of dollars to global GDP. In agriculture, for example, new use cases such as crop and livestock monitoring, farming by drone, drilling and production optimization and automation, and autonomous farming machinery all promise to radically reshape food production and accelerate sustainability. To help prepare for this next era of digital connectivity, more than 3,000 telecom leaders, analysts, and other industry players descended upon Copenhagen in September for the largest ever DTW (Digital Transformation World) global conference , an annual gathering sponsored by industry alliance TM Forum . The event, the first DTW conference to take place in person since the COVID-19 pandemic, came at a critical juncture for operators worldwide. As traditional value pools continue to erode, telcos are seeking to unlock new growth opportunities through data-driven transformation, an overhaul of traditional operating models, and novel approaches to ecosystem-building. McKinsey, a 2022 DTW knowledge partner, had a substantial presence throughout the three-day event. Our telco experts organized and participated in multiple sessions tackling some of the most urgent issues facing the industry, with McKinsey clients from the US, Europe, and Latin America discussing their challenges lessons, and achievements. “It was exciting the to see the momentum in the telco industry on full display, as leaders discussed the opportunities and challenges of becoming truly future-fit,” said McKinsey partner Duarte Begonha , who leads our core technology work in the telecom sector. “Telco leaders know that they need to think differently about collaboration, customer experience, talent, operating models, and what it takes to meet the needs of the modern enterprise.” Nik Willetts , President and CEO of TM Forum, said DTW 2022 would leave participants with “energy and inspiration” for urgent change and the importance of designing “the right operating model.” “We’re done talking about silver bullets from 5G,” Willetts told Duarte. He added: “It's about building a data-driven or AI-driven business, and the right operating model to achieve it.” In a session called “Thinking like a techco, not a telco: How to win in B2B,” Duarte outlined untapped B2B opportunities for connectivity providers—services like cloud and AI ops and next-generation connectivity products like SD-WAN and edge computing. The discussion included the impact of delayering, the need to change the CIO role to a COO role, shifting from a focus on just products to broad solutions, and establishing journeys specific to B2B customer needs. It was exciting the to see the momentum in the telco industry on full display, as leaders discussed the opportunities and challenges of becoming truly future-fit. In a McKinsey-driven session on data, partner Benjamim Vieira was joined by associate partners Sebastián Cubela and Victor Trigo , to discuss how to build a data-driven telco. A key strategy is digital twins : virtual representations of real-world products or systems, to collect and model data. “Digital twins bring together the mirrored [data] and intelligent [AI] worlds,” Sebastián said, adding that roughly three-quarters of large enterprises, across industries, are actively investing in them. In the final McKinsey session, on Cloud migration, partner Frederik Van Hecke discussed how telcos play a “marginal” role in the cloud market—for now. They can modernize their own IT systems to achieve scalability and cost efficiency; and as cloud suppliers, they can enrich ICT (information and communication technology) offerings for enterprise customers. “While there are multiple options, partnering with a cloud provider is the best viable option to quickly develop a capable cloud offering,” Frederik advised. related The Mobile World Congress insights shaping our conversations with tech and telco leaders Never miss a story"

This year also marked the first time McKinsey was an official air show partner. Throughout the week, at a purpose-built chalet overlooking the event’s airstrip, colleagues from McKinsey’s Aerospace and Defense Practice hosted hundreds of client executives and industry leaders to explore topics like the future of air mobility, sustainable aviation, diversity and inclusion, and resilience. “Our presence at Farnborough this year is a perfect expression of the way our practice has grown and expanded,” says senior partner Varun Marya , who helps lead McKinsey’s aerospace and defense work globally. “Today, working in areas from general aviation to space, we help our clients set bold agendas, implement technologies, and develop capabilities to improve their businesses in substantial and sustainable ways.” This work is informed by our expertise and perspective in the sector, which was on full display at Farnborough. Partner Jesse Klempner moderated a panel on “The Role of Space in Driving Sustainability and Security,” where he was joined by representatives from the European Space Agency, Lockheed Martin, the World Economic Forum, and the satellite internet provider OneWeb. Elsewhere, partner Robin Riedel , who co-leads the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, spoke on the event’s mainstage about what it will take to coordinate sector efforts and reach net zero by 2050. Later, along with leaders from the Mission Possible Partnership and the World Economic Forum, Robin convened an executive session on sustainable aviation at our McKinsey chalet and interviewed six industry disruptors whose ideas and innovations are shaping the future of aerospace and defense. Partner Emma Loxton also spoke about the road to net-zero aviation during a CFO panel that focused on building sustainable business models. Held on the event’s mainstage, the panel included executives from Rolls Royce, Shell, Virgin Atlantic, and ZeroAvia, a renewable-hydrogen aircraft developer. In another event, Emma held a reception for women working in aerospace at the McKinsey chalet, bringing together dozens of women executives and their allies to discuss inclusive talent. Clean skies for tomorrow: Delivering on the global power-to-liquid ambition That topic was the subject of one of our most widely talked-about reports of the week, Debugging the software talent gap in aerospace and defense . Published on one of the event’s busiest days, the report generated several client conversations and earned coverage in the print edition of Aviation International News’s air show daily. In it, the authors describe the skills deficit facing the industry, particularly on the tech front. They illustrate the opportunity companies have to “think differently” about their talent pipelines, which can be seized through several tactics, including increasing recruitment among traditionally underrepresented populations. Women, for example, are a third more underrepresented in aerospace and defense than they are in other sectors, and women of color make up just 10 percent of entry-level employees. One path to improving those figures lies in creating and nurturing enthusiasm for the industry among diverse groups of young people. Late in the week, we hosted the final round of the Air League’s 2022 Global Innovators Challenge. The Air League is a UK charity focused on changing lives through aviation, and this year’s challenge asked participants to propose ideas for accelerating the sector’s transition to zero-carbon emissions. Six finalists presented their ideas in front of a judging panel that included representatives from leading industry organizations; McKinsey was represented on the panel by Emma. The winning team, “Flush to Fly,” presented its concept to source sustainable aviation fuels from sewage waste, had the opportunity to present their concept at the event’s mainstage at the close of the week. related Are flying cars finally ready to take off?

However, data-driven opportunities to move faster and make better-informed finance and people decisions are challenging to seize and execute. With this in mind, McKinsey and Workday have teamed up to bring McKinsey-proprietary knowledge and analytics, benchmarks, and recommendations onto the Workday Enterprise Management Cloud . This alliance provides real-time data-driven insights and recommendations for the C-suite to solve challenges in finance and human resources. The combination of McKinsey’s expert insights across industries and functions paired with Workday’s innovative technology and analytics enables clients to address business challenges and maximize returns from their technology and data investments. In one case, for example, the collaboration between Workday and McKinsey resulted in a real-time dashboard that identifies sources of attrition – at the individual level – to help retain critical talent. McKinsey is also building a team of in-house experts to develop solutions directly within the Workday platform. “Companies today are navigating an increasingly dynamic environment, which requires new and innovative ways to solve business problems,” said Chano Fernandez, co-CEO of Workday. “By working with McKinsey, we look forward to delivering the next generation of analytics and insights to the C-suite so that our joint clients can address key business needs in finance and HR and maximize their investment in Workday.” There is perhaps no better time than now for an alliance between McKinsey and Workday, which will help leaders build thriving and resilient organizations. McKinsey and Workday have already achieved substantial impact in their initial phase of work, including enhancing Workday Strategic Sourcing by building a dynamic negotiation analytics engine to evaluate procurement bids. Within the first sixteen months of implementation, McKinsey and Workday refined, piloted, and successfully deployed the technology with more than 30 clients, capturing them nearly $2 billion in savings as measured by McKinsey. “Leaders are looking for the technology and expertise that will help them make the best decisions possible in this challenging moment,” said Bob Sternfels, McKinsey global managing partner. “There is perhaps no better time than now for an alliance between McKinsey and Workday, which will help leaders build thriving and resilient organizations.” Never miss a story"

April 22, 2022 As Head of Environmental Sustainability at McKinsey, each day I feel a mix of cautious optimism and burning urgency. On the one hand, I am energized by the incredible green solutions that are being developed to make operations more sustainable. This includes recent wins and milestones across technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels and carbon removals. Our fellow Sustainable Aviation Buyer’s Alliance member United Airlines recently completed the world’s first passenger flight on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel, while the Frontier initiative, of which McKinsey is a founding member , created an advance market commitment to buy $925 million of carbon removals by 2030. These examples show us that progress is possible, meaningful, and happening every day around the world. On the other hand, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments offer a stark reminder that we must recommit ourselves to our mission daily if we hope to limit global warming to 1.5°C degrees. One year ago, our firm committed to reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030 and set science-based targets for 2025 validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative in line with a 1.5°C-degree pathway. Since then, we have made significant progress that we can be proud of, and we also have a long way to go. Today, on Earth Day, I want to take a moment to reflect on our journey. Reducing absolute emissions from office operations by 25 percent Embracing electric transportation, shifting to renewable electricity, and creating sustainable office spaces. Within just one year, offices with the highest share of automobile transportation have introduced electric vehicle or hybrid vehicle policies. We are actively working on rolling this out globally — and for countries with nascent electric-vehicle infrastructure, we are exploring alternative mobility packages that enable our colleagues to use different transport options like rail passes, shared mobility memberships, or occasion-based access to rental cars. In terms of our electricity consumption, we were the first global consultancy to join RE100 in 2018, and we set a target of 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025. We reached 95 percent in 2020, and we are anticipating to have reached 97 percent for 2021. For countries without an established renewable energy certificate system, we are actively working with other RE100 members to send a demand signal to drive progress and scale up renewable energy production globally. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds of our existing global office space has achieved green-building certification. Reducing travel emissions by 30 percent per colleague Implementing hybrid working models and supporting the advancement of sustainable aviation fuels. Travel accounted for 83 percent of our firm’s 2019 carbon footprint. With the switch to remote working, we have seen travel drop by 70 to 80 percent over the last two years. As we shift back into the new normal, we are implementing hybrid working models, aiming to walk the fine line between maintaining the social fabric of our firm and how we serve our clients, all the while also drastically reducing emissions. Some examples include virtual recruiting, remote client engagements, and traveling for critical meetings only. Aside from traveling less, sustainable aviation fuels are the most promising near-term solution that can help us on our 2030 net-zero journey. These fuels have the potential to deliver the performance of fossil jet fuel with over 70 percent fewer lifecycle emissions. However, there is currently no accounting system approved by Greenhouse Gas Protocol to track a company’s emission reductions from sustainable aviation fuel against their science-based targets. A functioning certificate and accounting system will be critical to scale demand. This is one of the reasons we are founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance , and why we are working closely with the World Economic Forum Clean Skies For Tomorrow initiative as knowledge partners and signatories to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow 2030 Ambition Statement to reach 10 percent sustainable aviation fuel adoption by 2030. Halting the rise of global emissions is one of the world’s biggest challenges, and its complexity is an inspiration for us to work harder... As the world works toward a green overhaul, it can be intimidating to take on challenges that seem intractable. Our ethos at McKinsey is one of problem solving, and there is no challenge too great to solve.

Our experts on the numbers—and what’s at stake. Climate change will unevenly affect regions, sectors, and communities, with developing countries and those with large fossil-fuel resources among the most in need of a well-managed transition to net-zero. February 8, 2022 “It’s heartening that the conversation we are having now  is not ‘do we transition,’” says Mekala Krishnan, “but ‘how do we do it — and do it well?’” Mekala is a McKinsey partner who led the work on our new report, The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring , that focuses on the economic and societal changes needed to limit the planet to  1.5°C degrees of average warming. It analyzes the implications for demand, capital spending, costs, and the impact on jobs in the sectors that produce 85 percent of overall emissions. It also looks at what this will mean for 69 countries, in some cases down to the county level. “Often when we discuss the net-zero transition, we focus on the end-state,” says Mekala . “But this report offers an unconventional lens: we take a close look at the sheer magnitude of the changes along the way of this massive undertaking to help leaders prepare for and understand what to expect.” We spoke with Mekala and two members of the research team: Danielle Imperato , an engagement manager, and Ryan Barrett , a climate risk specialist, to learn more. First, how did you come to work on sustainability at McKinsey? Danielle: I’ve been focusing on energy transition and decarbonization here for about three years. Working on reports like this one and the net-zero Europe report has been an energizing and invaluable complement to client work. Ryan: I’ve long had a personal interest in sustainability topics. Early in my career, I had the opportunity to highlight the connections between climate change, finance, and the economy at a financial institution, where I created scenarios for transitioning to a net-zero economy. It was good preparation for my work on this report years later. Mekala: I knew I wanted to work on the most important, complex, and systemic problems that affect the most people around the world—and to help create a better world for our next generation. I led the work on our physical climate risk report in January 2020, which laid out the imperative for the net-zero transition—which is the focus of this new report. What changes should leaders expect in a full-scale net-zero transition? Mekala: First, a net-zero transition will be universal, affecting every country and sector. It will be significant. We model a particular net-zero scenario from the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of central banks. In this scenario, $9.2 trillion will need to be spent per year over the next 30 years on physical assets, such as renewable power and infrastructure for electric vehicles. That’s a $3.5 trillion increase from what we’re spending today. The transition will also be front-loaded, in that we need to take action and deploy capital now for benefits down the road. If the transition is delayed or disorderly, it will come with a lot of risk... But if it is managed well, it brings opportunity for everyone. Perhaps most importantly, it will unevenly affect countries, sectors, and communities—this is the heart of the climate challenge. Developing countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Kenya, and those with large fossil fuel resources such as Qatar, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, will be among those where the most significant economic shifts could be needed; as well as sectors such as power, mobility, and heavy industry. Finally, if the transition is delayed or disorderly, it will come with a lot of risk, such as energy supply shortages, stranded infrastructure assets, price increases, and worker dislocation. But if it is managed well, it brings opportunity for everyone; this is what we all have to work towards. What about jobs? Ryan: We estimate that 185 million jobs would be lost by 2050 while 200 million direct and indirect jobs will be gained.  But it’s important to put these numbers in context; they are relatively smaller compared to what we would estimate for shifts driven by automation, the future of work, and other macroeconomic forces. As Mekala pointed out, this shift will be uneven—the losses and gains will be concentrated in specific sectors and geographies, which is a challenge that has to be managed well. Managing the transition well will take good leadership. How will the net-zero transition shape corporate agendas? Danielle: From a day-to-day standpoint, we will see sustainability become ingrained in every part of a company’s agenda. Whether it’s a defining strategy for new and existing products; managing supply chains; or assessing risk and making capital allocations, climate will become a deciding factor. Businesses will have to hire new types of talent to manage environmental requirements and develop new means for reporting progress to all of their stakeholders. Every colleague will be affected, from the leaders setting the agenda to the front-line workers creating and selling the products or services. How might our lives as consumers change? Ryan: At the moment, consumers suffer from a lack of choice—it’s hard to find sustainable goods at affordable prices. Over the next five years, I expect it’ll become easier to make the choice to lower emissions in your day-to-day life, whether it’s about which car you buy, how you heat and cool your house, which household items you use, or other consumer choices. Finally, what will it take to ensure this transition happens in an inclusive way? Mekala: As someone who comes from India, which will likely be disproportionately exposed to the physical and economic risks of climate change and the net-zero transition, I think it is extremely important to keep in mind. For this transition to be inclusive, leaders will need to create incentives that account for the inherent unevenness of the problem. This has to be a shared problem, otherwise there will be winners and losers.

This August, he became the global leader of our Marketing & Sales Practice . A married father of four who lives in Atlanta and grew up in Virginia and Kentucky, Greg has spent his career focusing on helping clients grow and outperform in the consumer sector. We spoke with him to learn more about his background, how he thinks about growth now and in the future, and what McKinsey is doing to help clients get there in a sustainable and inclusive way. Tell us a little about your background and how it has shaped you. Education has always been a priority for my family. My grandfather was a student in a one-room schoolhouse in Appalachia. He saw firsthand the way that education could change lives, and he dedicated his life to that mission. He worked as a school superintendent in Virginia for 46 years. My father followed in his footsteps. He was a college professor, and he served as president of a women’s university. I see education the same way they did. Good education empowers and mobilizes people. It gives people choices and opportunities to pursue their desired professions and, most importantly, it enables growth—both on an individual and macro level. Investments in education and training programs that teach and reinforce people’s skills increase workforce participation, decrease unemployment, and upskill workers. Family is another passion of yours. What’s a lesson from them you bring to your client work? Understand aspirations before you rush to advice and solutions. I have a son more passionate about tech company rivalries than sports rivalries, a daughter with a computer science degree who’s pursuing priesthood, a highly-creative daughter exploring a career in marketing, and a transgender son focused on animal welfare and human rights who’d like to be a veterinarian. I have learned from them to search for what gives them real meaning and purpose and to help them prioritize their pursuits for getting there no matter how different they may be from my wife or me, or each other. We often refer to a poem in our home that advises parents to give children “roots and wings.” For me, roots are what your values are, where you come from, and wings enable you to go off and achieve your dreams. Similarly, with clients, my focus is on listening to them, understanding their context, helping them set their aspirations, and then getting specific on how they can achieve them. How does McKinsey think about helping clients grow? Being an impact partner for our clients today means helping them fuel their recoveries, which will restart our economies and in turn speed the world’s recovery. But this isn’t about growth at all costs; sustainable and inclusive growth requires understanding how the future of communities and the environment are deeply intertwined and understanding how driving social equity and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive. In today’s transparent world, consumers understand just how much of an impact companies have on the environment and society. And so, companies with a relatable purpose that is authentic to their heritage are the ones that resonate most for consumers. We’re thinking hard about how we can help our clients grow and make an impact that transcends the bottom line and improves communities and the environment. How can they help their people develop and reskill where necessary? How can they not just cut emissions but restore, renew, and replenish the environment? These questions are top-of-mind for the CEOs I serve now. What’s the most exciting trend in marketing and sales right now? Selling direct-to-consumer (DTC). Consumer decision journeys —what, how, where and when they buy, and how they interact with a brand post-purchase—have been completely upended throughout the pandemic. Seventy-five percent of consumers have tried new digital behaviors. E-commerce sales penetration in the United States more than doubled to about 35 percent in 2020 from around 16 percent the previous year, the equivalent of roughly ten years of growth in a few months. All this accelerated growth has driven our clients to move. Consumer-facing brands are looking to connect with consumers in a more personalized way at scale. Business-to-business (B2B) digital commerce is also undergoing a major transformation as buyers have flexed to remote and digital ways of engaging. Eight in ten B2B leaders say that omnichannel is just as or more effective than traditional methods. To connect directly with its customers, B2B leaders are completely changing their go-to-market approach by building new DTC models at record speeds. For example, one company we worked with stood up a new DTC model in a matter of months, which would typically have taken years. And more companies are innovating their sales approaches and allocating resources at speeds not experienced before using a hybrid sales model. The growth triple play: Creativity, analytics, and purpose Lastly, where and how do you see CEOs driving transformative growth in 2022? Uncertainty is the new certainty. While there is no playbook for this kind of disruption, there are courses of actions leaders should be considering and planning. From a marketing and sales perspective, with inflation rising, the most important immediate action is to strengthen value propositions and plan for 2022 price increases. Our assessments show that inflation will abate but not evenly across commodities and companies. Companies need to have 2022 aspirations that address the increase and go beyond relying on discounts and promotions by putting the customer front and center. Second, leaders need plans to accelerate ahead of the digital and e-commerce shift. Too many companies are still trailing, waiting for it to become more significant. Consumers increasingly expect the same type of digital engagement and fulfillment as they experience in their personal lives, and most suppliers are not delivering it. Finally, leaders are strengthening what we call full-funnel marketing —an approach that combines brand building and performance marketing. While virtually every company has opportunities to continue to improve their performance marketing, which relies on granular data and predictive analytics, our work shows that it has to be complemented with a focus on building awareness and brand love.

Meet two partners on a mission to help women of color lead at work,"Women of color have faced disproportionate challenges in the workplace, especially during the pandemic. Sara Prince and Gayatri Shenai talk about their work to combat this trend among colleagues and clients.",2021-09-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/two%20partners%20commit%20to%20finding%20the%20missing%20women%20in%20the%20workplace/blog-women-of-color-support-1164229682-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,"Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/two-partners-commit-to-finding-the-missing-women-in-the-workplace,"Meet two partners on a mission to help women of color lead at work September 10, 2021 A record number of women have left the US workforce during the COVID-19 crisis. Of those, Black and Latina women have faced disproportionate challenges, with unemployment rates climbing to nearly 9 percent for both groups. Our research has shown that there is a correlation between profitability and companies that build inclusive cultures of diverse talent. To do so effectively, leaders must be role models of change who go beyond words and implement change. Two of our colleagues, partners Gayatri Shenai and Sara Prince , have served as moderators at the Minority Women Lead conference, which is dedicated to helping women of color advance in the workplace. They talked to us about how they’re helping support minority women colleagues as well as clients. How has the pandemic shaped your focus on women in the workplace—and particularly women of color? Sara: Honestly, my priorities haven’t changed.  The twin pandemic issue of the global health crisis and racial inequity only bring into sharp focus the very real issues women, women of color, and even more specifically Black women, face. Gayatri: For me, COVID has been an opportunity to celebrate women’s achievements—for example, those in STEM —and to thank them for all they do every day. I prioritize my day around people—which means having conversations with my clients, my teams, my colleagues, and people in my community. We talk about personal and professional development goals. I offer whatever advice I can. As a consultant so accustomed to solving problems, one tough lesson I’ve learned is that not all problems necessarily need a solution. Sometimes as a leader, your people need you to just be there to listen, even if it’s for 10 minutes. What’s most top-of-mind for your women minority clients and colleagues right now? Gayatri: As more companies talk about the return to the office, there’s growing concern that the inequities women of color have faced will be even more exacerbated. Even before the pandemic, women of color were promoted more slowly than other groups of employees and were less likely to say their manager advocated for new opportunities for them. In this moment, connectivity is what everyone’s talking about. Sara: Building off the return-to-office topic, leaders are having to make tough choices about the spectrum of flexibility they will allow while teammates and employees are making tough choices about what working dynamics they will accept.  In that, the focus on support for a diverse profile of leaders can get lost. There is a bit of tension as to whether all the work for racial justice and equity will fade to the backdrop in this moment. How is McKinsey helping organizations respond to these challenges? Gayatri: As a firm, we have been raising this issue, creating awareness and getting organizations to act through our research , publications and work with clients. We’ve also developed programs specifically focused on elevating executives of color to reach their professional aspirations. One such example is our Black Leadership Academy . Sara: What’s particularly impactful about our Black Leadership Academy, which is one of our 10 actions to advance racial justice and equity, is that it’s an opportunity to spend time with leaders of participating organizations and help them think about how they reshape their talent pipelines to be more inclusive.  In addition to this, our Institute for Black Economic Mobility is helping equip communities and organizations with the facts and insights they need to take action. What we lose when we lose women in the workforce We know women of color are more often under-mentored and under-sponsored than their White counterparts. How are you both working to change that at McKinsey? Gayatri: Anytime I have a new opportunity—like a speaking engagement, for instance—I offer it to a minority woman before anyone else. I’ve also formed a habit of checking in on them regularly to see how they are feeling, what’s going on for them, and how I can be helpful. In the last year, I’ve found myself starting emails with an acknowledgement of thanks—letting these women know I appreciate them and their work. This could be following a difficult analysis they drove, a client meeting they led, a conference they moderated. The feedback I have received is that it helps them feel seen and appreciated and makes a difference in morale. Sara: I’ve been doing 15-minute zoom hangouts with folks on my team. They are optional, but it clears time to be connected in a way that’s not necessarily about a specific workstream or deliverable. I have also been looking for those quiet voices and asking them for time to check in. Separately, I’ve been involved in putting together a series of events as part of our Black Leadership Academy that brings our current and former women participants together for discussions. It’s intended to help foster a community for these women to network, and we’re now extending it to our Asian, Hispanic, and Latino Leadership Academies as well. I just try to be a listening ear where they can put down whatever mask they are holding up for a few minutes. We all need that space of relief so we can keep doing the hard work of forging new paths. Do you have the opportunity to do similar things with your clients? How so? Gayatri: In the world of the pandemic, virtual happy hours with a glass of wine have been my go-to, but I also have clients who WhatsApp, text, FaceTime, and just call me. We share laughs and also frustrations over what feels toughest right now, and I’m just happy to be a listening ear and friendly face for them to vent to. Sara: I make a conscious choice to spend time with clients of diverse profiles to really understand their aspirations and how they want to shape their organizations beyond a particular engagement.  I use that insight to offer perspective on how they can get there including flagging to their leaders how they can be helpful to that persons’ journey. Many times though, I just try to listen and create a space where they can put down whatever mask they are holding up for a few minutes. We all need that space of relief so we can keep doing the hard work of forging new paths. Finally, in your view, where can organizations make the greatest progress on diversity and inclusion right now? Gayatri: If we all wait for organizations to get it right, we will fail. Ultimately, an organization is a collection of people. Leaders and managers need to role model and get in front of this issue. If they can find ways to let women on their teams know they matter and are supported and appreciated, that’s when we’ll see real change. Sara: The biggest change over the last year and a half is people’s willingness to discuss the issues and try to take more action to address them. What’s important now is that we don’t lose the focus, commitment, and accountability that the past year has brought us. related A McKinsey leader unites women in tech to prepare for the future of work How we’re building the next generation of Black executive leaders Never miss a story"

Guangyu is co-leader of Equal at McKinsey, McKinsey’s global network for LGBTQ+ colleagues. Here, he reflects on courage, representation, and allyship. You were born in China but have studied and worked in several countries, including the U.S. and Canada. How has that shaped your perspective on diversity and inclusion? I had planned to go to university in Canada or the U.S. Back then, half of the motivation came from a chance to be my true self. At the time, I perceived those countries to be more open, and my choice to study at McGill ended up opening my mind in ways I couldn’t have expected. For the first time in my life, I was part of an association for gay and lesbian students, and the group had lively weekly discussions that were fascinating to me. I left China in 1989, and the notion of being able to come out at that time felt like a privilege. I was wowed when, in my first days at McGill, I got the student handbook and it had a section on safe sex education, the directory listings of all the student organizations, and then all the discussions going on in the college newspaper. You just can’t imagine what it was like for me. It was like opening up a joy box. When I came out to my family in 1995, they were so worried. Back then, pretty much everybody I knew associated being gay with AIDS, because most of the newspaper articles, especially the newspaper articles in China, reflected that. So when I heard that McKinsey was recruiting at places like Harvard Business School, I was thrilled. When I got my offer, I couldn’t wait to share that precious news with my family and my friends. It was like, “Hey, you know it’s really not what you think. You don’t have to worry that I might not be able to get a good job.” It meant a lot to me—a lot, lot more than people could imagine today. What was it like to come out at McKinsey? I went through a few stages. When I first decided to bring my significant other to a retreat as a second-year associate, many close friends outside the firm were saying, “Are you ready to ruin your career?” They wanted to make sure I was ready for anything that might come next. But I thought, this could go one of two ways. On the one hand, it could ruin my career. And if it had, I would have been happy to leave. I don’t need to stay in a place where I work hard but can’t feel comfortable with who I am. But on the other hand, I might find a place that embraced me, and I might go on to spend a significant chunk of my career there. It turned out to be the latter—and I’m so happy it did. And then you went on to co-lead Equal at McKinsey globally. After I came out, I heard from colleagues who were scared to do the same or skeptical of the response they would get. It underscored how important it is to have allies. I’ve especially been excited to get involved with local Equal at McKinsey chapters around our different office locations. It’s incredibly rewarding to be able to help people feel more comfortable at work, and it’s crucial for attracting talent, so it carries both personal and professional meaning to me. Who have been some of your biggest allies at the firm? The firm has been supportive as a whole over many years. One of our earliest supporters was Kevin Sneader. He talked about it with me in Hong Kong long before his election to managing partner. I remember he said, “If we want to do this right, we better do it in a very big, bold way, rather than small incremental changes.” That made a huge difference. Right after his election, we decided to have the first-ever global Alliance , a McKinsey-led gathering for LGBTQ+ business executives. Then we had a global Equal at McKinsey conference for colleagues. I immediately sent invitations to Kevin. Within the day, I got a confirmation from him, saying he would give it his priority. And he did. We’ve made a lot of big strides as a result of Kevin’s leadership, and we’re so excited knowing this is one of Bob Sternfels ’s priorities as well—and to continue our progress under his upcoming tenure as global managing partner. You and Diana Ellsworth, a fellow Equal at McKinsey co-leader, recently sent a personal note to the Asians at McKinsey group about the racist attacks their communities have been suffering. What prompted that? Diana and I have both experienced being a minority during our lives. And during my time in North America, I experienced being a dual minority of sorts. It shouldn’t be left to any individual community to defend itself. It’s in our collective interest to show up for each other with concrete action and to come together in solidarity. And this is very much in the tradition of McKinsey—we’re a global firm, not just because we work in places around the world. Our people are part of communities around the world, so it’s imperative we support them. I know personally how meaningful it is to be able to bring your whole, authentic self to work, and I want to ensure our colleagues globally feel empowered to do so as well. related To celebrate National Coming Out Day, five McKinsey colleagues talk identity and inclusion Never miss a story"
Four lessons in business-building from our work with Tech for Good innovators,"From the team supporting Nesta’s Rapid Recovery Challenge semifinalists, tips on scaling for social good.",2021-04-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/lessons%20in%20business%20building%20from%20tech%20for%20good%20innovators/techforgood-hero-small-1058881454-1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/lessons-in-business-building-from-tech-for-good-innovators,"Four lessons in business-building from our work with Tech for Good innovators Focuses on digital innovation and is a strategic advisor to banking, fintech, and Tech for Good organizations on scalability and growth. Coleads the Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice in the UK and Ireland; leads digital and growth transformations in both B2C and B2B environments. Focuses on value proposition for fintech startups in UK and Europe. Supports founders and tech businesses to grow and reach financial sustainability. April 9, 2021 The Tech for Good movement is all about applying technology to areas like job security, health, education, safety, and elsewhere to improve lives and livelihoods. Nesta, one of the UK’s leading innovation foundations for social good, launched their Rapid Recovery Challenge in September 2020 to identify and support organizations that promise to improve access to jobs and financial stability for people living in the UK, focusing particularly on those impacted by the economic shock delivered by COVID-19. For the last two months, we have supported Rapid Recovery Challenge semi-finalists pro bono by helping them refine their value propositions, plan their customer distribution, and review their business models. To them, success means social impact. Sustainable scalability and ‘reach’ were at the core of these conversations; the more support to vulnerable users, the higher the potential for impact on people’s livelihoods and career development. When we asked them, ‘What does success mean for you?’ many said their core focus was to reach and help as many people as possible with their solution. To them, success means social impact. What consistently stood out from our workshops with social entrepreneurs was the passion of the founders and their teams. They are driven by missions bigger than themselves and dedicate their entire energy to support the most vulnerable. This energy and willingness to serve others is contagious. As we await the announcement of the challenge’s finalists next month, we wanted to share what we’ve learned through these conversations in hopes of helping other Tech for Good innovators scale their solutions and bring the greatest good to the greatest number of people possible. Tech for Good: Helping the United Kingdom improve lives and livelihoods Know your customers; understand their needs and where their attention is. Your customer base is often not a single, homogenous group. The wider the group you aim to serve, the harder the path, but you don’t need to serve everyone at the same time. To improve effectiveness, organizations can focus on specific customers, reverse engineer their specific needs, and map where their attention is. This simple exercise refocuses the effort of the organization into what really matters for their target users. For instance, a semi-finalist was targeting a very wide group of users, some of whom were more tech-savvy than others. As such, they decided to explore non-digital channels, too, in order to adapt and optimize their outreach impact. Do less to do more, especially where it matters. Understanding where to best direct your limited resources is a difficult art to master. This is especially the case when you are in an early stage of your organization’s maturity, when resources are limited and a clear product or solution has not yet emerged. Many of the semi-finalists (and a lot of companies) have a number of great ideas they could potentially test in unlimited directions. But given the limits of time and resources available, what is often required is bold focus on fewer options, establishing a roadmap, executing step by step, and adapting the plan if needed. Yes, you can do anything—but not everything at the same time. When partnering with other organizations, be a value-provider for them—and their network. When scaling a Tech for Good organization, take the time to identify potential partners who share your mission and values. Think about how you can help them — whether it’s developing a product, an initiative for their employees, or a joint campaign that will publicly demonstrate how they live the values you both share. If you find how to contribute to their journey, you may find inroads to a relationship. And when you do, don’t be afraid to ask for their help finding more partners among their suppliers, distributors, retailers, media agencies, or other organizations they know who might be interested in working with you Your users’ voices are a living proof of the value of your solution. Stories from satisfied users are rewarding for you and your team; they’re also a useful metric of success. As you see your product fulfilling its mission, you can use feedback from your customers both to understand the impact you create and as testimonials demonstrate the power of your solution. The individual stories of your team members are likely to become the shared story of the organization. Learn how to read them, identify your unique strengths, and communicate them loudly. These tangible, impact-oriented, real-life stories are what make your product distinctive—and memorable. A 2020 McKinsey.com article described how Tech for Good innovations offer innovative paths to drive sustainable and inclusive economic growth over the next decades, while improving key aspects of societal living. All of the semi-finalists we worked with on this initiative drove this home in a powerful way. They reminded us that it is now more important, and powerful, than ever to use technology to support solidarity and inclusivity across society.

"This year, we aim to welcome more new colleagues than ever before","We&rsquo;ve broadened our search for exceptional people who can help us serve clients in technology, change management, design, and much more.",2021-02-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our People,Recruiting",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/welcoming-more-new-colleagues-than-ever,"This year, we aim to welcome more new colleagues than ever before February 23, 2021 This year may see many of us transition into the next normal, and for more people than ever, we hope that shift will include embarking on a McKinsey career. In 2021, we aim to hire more new colleagues than at any time in our 96-year history. Together, they’ll fulfill dozens of different kinds of roles across cloud, data, and software engineering; implementation and change management; user and product design; business presentation support; and, naturally, strategic consulting. “We’re growing and have seen that during this time of such uncertainty and change our clients have sought our support and advice more than ever,” says Brian Rolfes, the McKinsey partner who heads our global recruiting. “We opened two new locations in 2020 - Nuremberg and Santo Domingo - building on the 40 we opened in the last decade. We welcomed more than 5,000 full-time colleagues and 1,500 interns globally in 2020. And we recently acquired a new cloud consulting firm .” That growth will help us better serve clients across a wide range of business functions, and it’s also helping us build a more diverse and inclusive firm that better reflects the communities in which we live and operate. We’ve expanded our recruiting strategy to include more historically Black colleges and universities in the US. “We are in a movement, not a moment,” says Roselyn Cason-Marcus, an associate director of recruiting and senior McKinsey Black Network hiring and retention. “Our leaders and our teams are working together, pushing forward, to create an even more inclusive environment where distinctive Black talent feels welcome and can thrive.” Overall, we search for and find talent at a growing number of institutions — more than 370 schools last year — and hire talented experienced professionals from industry, academia, tech, and the sciences. 2020 tested our firm, as it did every organization, in a range of ways. Our top concern was and remains the health and safety of our people, who we supported through several wellbeing programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the ability to work side-by-side with our clients onsite vanished overnight, forcing us to quickly adapt to virtual and remote settings. Whether we’re helping clients navigate COVID-19, protect the environment, fight for racial equality and inclusion, or lead the way in technical solutions, the efforts of McKinsey colleagues matter. During that time, as the stay at home orders were unfolding, we honored our outstanding full-time and intern offers. More than 1,000 interns globally—including more than 500 in our North American offices—were onboarded virtually, trained remotely, and connected with project teams that provided authentic McKinsey experiences. “After joining, my virtual onboarding was smooth and professional,” said Ikram Mecheri, a business analyst in our Montreal office. “I received all my IT equipment a week before my start date, so I was ready on day one. Several colleagues reached out to welcome me and make me feel at ease. I immediately felt at home.” We have been recruiting for our summer 2021 interns and are excited and ready to welcome them in whatever virtual or hybrid fashion COVID-19 will allow. Last year saw us strengthen our client selection process and due-diligence efforts to help ensure that we create positive, enduring change in all our work. In response to COVID-19, we helped several organizations save lives and livelihoods by tapping into the expertise and experience of colleagues who are experts across a range of critical areas, including public health, healthcare operations, vaccines development, manufacturing and supply chains, and more. Elsewhere, among several sustainability efforts, we worked with the World Economic Forum’s Nature and Net Zero initiative to analyze how to create a voluntary carbon market of unprecedented scale to help combat climate change. And we are now one of 61 organizations that will share metrics focused on “people, planet, prosperity, and governance” as part of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative. The murder of George Floyd galvanized our commitment to anti-racism. In June, we committed to 10 Actions for advancing racial equality at work, and during the Davos Agenda this January, we became a founding member of the World Economic Forum’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business initiative, a new global coalition dedicated to fighting racism in the workplace. Our 10 actions toward racial equity Our work to find the best talent wherever it resides will accelerate over the coming months. For now, most of our recruiting events and interviews—like most of our client work—will be conducted virtually, as we follow local government requirements and health authority best practices to put the safety, health and well-being of our candidates and colleagues first. But even in a virtual world, says Brian, there remains perhaps no better place to work on challenges facing the world and organizations today. “Whether we’re helping clients navigate COVID-19, protect the environment, fight for racial equality and inclusion, or lead the way in technical solutions,” says Brian, “the efforts of McKinsey colleagues matter.” related Build a reef?

Photo by Andrew Eckmann December 11, 2020 Today we launch the fourth part of our knowledge partnership with CNBC, on sustainability, as senior partner Dickon Pinner discusses the importance of making economic and environmental resiliency core to the COVID-19 recovery. Our research shows that a low-carbon recovery could not only significantly reduce emissions, but also create more jobs and economic growth. As Dickon explains, the next decade is decisive for climate action: Warmer temperatures over the next ten years will bring greater risk of physical and economic hazards. And after 2030, the pace of warming depends on human actions, requiring a collaborative response to reach net zero emissions by 2050. We spoke to Dickon, who leads our global Sustainability practice , about the extent of climate change’s risks, how organizations can transform to become more sustainable, and why a green post-pandemic recovery is critical on the path to the next normal. The challenge of climate change 1. Why is a green recovery critical on the path to the next normal? Confronting climate change was critical even before COVID-19. Now, as we work to protect lives and livelihoods from both the public-health and economic crisis as a result of the outbreak, investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive the post-pandemic recovery by providing significant near-term job creation and increasing economic and environmental resiliency for the long term. Research has shown that climate change can actually contribute to pandemics . For example, rising temperatures can create favorable conditions for the spread of certain infectious, mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. Addressing climate change now can help us become more resilient for the future. 2. In the CNBC video, you share that a utility player could save $1 billion over 20 years by investing in climate resilience. Given this potential economic impact, why is change still so hard? For new players, I’m not sure change is so hard. We’ve seen that capital markets are wide open for investment in green businesses in a way that they’ve never been before: Interest rates are at historical lows, technology costs have fallen, and financial regulators are beginning to nudge investors, so the risk-reward equation is beginning to shift. These new companies won’t likely struggle to attract capital, but talent—and getting the right people and capabilities in place. For incumbents, there can be an inertia from doing things a certain way. A number of things have to be reallocated to change: Leaders have to move capital away from day-to-day business to something new, free up people to manage and implement that new approach, and have a shift in mindset in the way they assess climate-related risks. Organizations frequently don’t have these capabilities in place—and moving large capital from one area of the business to another can be confusing for shareholders—so it’s a difficult challenge. 3. How, then, do you counsel CEOs to act to prevent the risk climate change poses not only to their businesses—but society at large? It’s so important that companies have a complete and granular understanding of how their own businesses are shaping climate change. Without that, leaders are likely over-exposed to the risks, such as physical climate threats to their infrastructure or falling demand for their products, and underexposed to opportunities around approaches, like building resiliency in their operations, investing in innovation, or reducing emissions. Climate change is already having socioeconomic impacts in some specific regions. Our research has shown how disruptions will impact workability, livability, assets, infrastructure services, food systems, and natural capital. It all relies on a stable climate, which we do not have. That’s why courageous leadership is needed like never before—and that’s across industry, regulation, tech, and capital. We’ll need the creativity and dynamism of business to be an engine for innovation and delivery. We’ll need finance to mobilize capital, reward productivity, and price risk. And we’ll need thoughtful regulation to direct market forces and solve equity issues. 4. In which industries can a more sustainable approach to business have the most impact? Perhaps the unsurprising answer is: all of them. The entire global economy needs to transition to avoid the most serious effects of climate change in the future. To give an example, agriculture may become the “new Oil & Gas.” As the world’s eyes turn to the inefficiencies in the food and land use industries, agriculture will become increasingly recognized as one of the big untapped decarbonization and negative emissions levers. I also think that insurance markets will grow and change significantly . The world is overexposed to the risk of climate change, and underinsured, driving innovations like parametric pricing, insurance-linked securities, and public-private partnerships to manage their exposure. 5. What are some of the ways we’re working with clients that you’re most excited about? We recently worked with a global retailer to do a physical assessment of its nearly 10,000 stores. We looked at the physical climate risks to the company’s assets, but also the commodities and supply chains feeding those assets. We uncovered that the main source of vulnerability were actually the people and materials flowing into and out of its stores—and that the way to address that risk was to diversify its supply chain and invest in new technology that would be more resistant to the risks we identified. Elsewhere, we’re working with a leading alternative protein startup that’s focused on changing dietary behavior. We’re helping the company with its international expansion strategy so that it can scale its impact globally. 6. You’re a physicist by training. Why did you want to lead McKinsey’s sustainability work? I was a bit of an anomaly going into a career in science, having grown up in a family of musicians and actors. It was nice coming back to a house where no one really knew what I did. I spent my early career at the firm almost exclusively in the semiconductor industry, working around the world doing a lot of capital productivity operations improvement work. A little over ten years ago, cleantech was beginning to really take off, specifically solar panels—technology that happens to be largely based on semiconductors. Climate change is one of the biggest risks we face globally—from the urgency of managing the physical and economic risks to the opportunity sustainability holds for every sector, there is tremendous work to do that will require tremendous cooperation from governments, regulators, companies, and other organizations. Because our firm works across industries, functions, and geographies, we’re uniquely positioned to have impact and help move the needle. It’s a privilege—and also an obligation. When Kevin Sneader talks about creating change that matters, I can think of no better work that fits that theme. related Six sustainability priorities from our new climate change compendium Never miss a story"
Partnering with Rethink Food to create a more equitable U.S. food system,"With more Americans facing food insecurity, a McKinsey team based in New York City helped create a program to safely feed people while keeping restaurants running.",2020-11-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/partnering%20with%20rethink%20food%20to%20create%20a%20more%20equitable%20us%20food%20system/rethink-hero-small-team-1536x864.jpg,"COVID-19,Inclusive Economy,Social Impact,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/partnering-with-rethink-food-to-create-a-more-equitable-us-food-system,"Partnering with Rethink Food to create a more equitable U.S. food system November 2, 2020 Prior to COVID-19, an estimated 37 million Americans were food insecure, with limited and uncertain access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods. Since the start of the outbreak—due to the pandemic’s impact on jobs—nearly 17 million additional people now face food insecurity in the U.S., accounting for a 46 percent increase. The effects of this crisis have been felt across the country, and in cities where larger restaurant cultures exist, they have been particularly grim. Among them is New York City. A shelter-in place-order from mid-March through early June saw thousands of restaurants suddenly close and leave millions of people out of work. “This had an almost immediate trickle-down effect on so many other areas,” says Jill Zucker , a McKinsey senior partner and leader of the New York office. “During April, food pantries and soup kitchens suddenly reported running out of food with a spike in first-time visitors.” In an effort to support and give back to this community, Jill and other McKinsey colleagues from the New York office quickly formed a team and began pro-bono work with the non-profit Rethink Food . Historically, the non-profit had worked with restaurants and corporate cafeterias to donate their excess food to community-based organizations. “When COVID-19 began, we wanted to find the best way to use our capital to feed people safely while keeping businesses running,” says Matt Jozwiak , founder and CEO at Rethink Food. To provide immediate short-term support to industry employees, McKinsey and Rethink Food developed Rethink Certified , a program where participating restaurants commit to making a certain number of meals in their kitchens each week, over a twelve-week period, which then get donated to community-based organizations. “As a native New Yorker, it was painful and scary to see the pandemic’s impact on this city—both from a humanitarian and livelihood perspective,” says Tejas Shah , an associate partner at McKinsey. “On a personal level, watching my wife on the frontlines as a physician made me feel even more compelled to find a way to help any way I could.” From April through July, Rethink Food raised $10 million to fund Rethink Certified. Not only did those contributions support two million meals made across 40-plus restaurant partners, they also helped create over 100 jobs. “Our goal is to create lasting change in our communities, and the Rethink Certified model will feed those in need while helping to stabilize restaurants—not just in times of crisis,"" says Matt. “As a former culinary professional, I see the benefit of the additional, predictable revenue stream restaurants will receive to prepare meals for their local community based organizations.” Food security “My background is in cooking,” Matt explains, “so having a team that could help structure what the program would look like and help answer questions about which restaurants should participate, or how to match restaurants with community organizations in an efficient way, was critical.” In addition to helping scale the Restaurant Response Program quickly, the McKinsey team helped  Rethink Food redesign its organizational structure. “To keep up with all the changes they were pursuing, Rethink Food needed to make a number of key hires to give Matt leverage  and support the organization's exponential growth,” says Doug Patterson , an engagement manager at McKinsey. “Our team worked with them to define the organizational changes and process improvements that would be required to maintain their momentum.” By early summer, a new COO and CFO had been hired—two new roles to the organization. Elsewhere, colleagues from Aberkyn , a McKinsey company of change facilitators, worked with Matt to help develop his leadership style, manage his team relationships, and improve ways of working with the board of directors and other stakeholders. Once Rethink Certified was up and running, the team began work to help sustain its efforts—and create a more equitable food system at large. Doug explains that the certification program established a national ""always on"" source of meals for those in need. “By having a network of restaurants already in place, operationally set up and paired with community-based organizations for distribution, Rethink Food's partners can mobilize in real-time to meet elevated needs in future crises.""  Unlike the pressure food banks had from rising meal demands with COVID-19’s onset, scaling this type of program across the country ensures the right infrastructure will be in place for when we’ll need it. Similar to LEED certification for buildings, being Rethink Certified signifies a restaurant’s commitment towards a more sustainable and equitable food system. “Once you have it, you’re branded as part of the network—visible to consumers on online platforms like food delivery and reservation services,” says Doug. Additionally, the program includes a rating system whereby community-based organizations rate restaurants' performance to ensure they consistently meet program standards. “We’ve always wanted to bring restaurants and community centers closer to each other and felt this would help enhance the level of transparency between the two and ensure restaurants feel accountable for their actions,” Matt explains. Rethink Certified program participants must commit to making 50,000 meals a year and in return, Rethink Food will fund them $250,000. Since launching this summer, over 600 restaurants have applied to get certified. The first Rethink Certified restaurant was Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park where chef, owner, and Rethink Food co-founder Daniel Humm has praised the program for enabling restaurants to make feeding their communities a part of a long-term business model. “I don’t want to just cook for the one percent anymore when we know that 10 percent of people may not know where their next meal is coming from,” he says. “Any projects we do in the future will always have this in mind.” Rethink Food is now focused on expanding into other U.S. cities beyond the existing New York, San Francisco, Nashville, and Chicago locations. “We’re looking at the data that underpins Rethink Certified,” says Tejas. Through data from Rethink Food’s delivery partners, the McKinsey team will be identifying ways to further boost impact and get feedback from participants. One example is matching restaurants with community-based organizations right in their neighborhood to reduce the burden on the delivery component. “There’s so much excess capacity in restaurants and demand for a more food secure system in a post-COVID world,” says Matt. “Restaurants just need the capital to realize this, but this type of work will always be needed.” Never miss a story"
How are working women doing during COVID-19? Our Women in the Workplace study explores.,A co-leader of our flagship work on gender inequality in corporate America explains how COVID-19 is shaping the experiences of women at work.,2020-09-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20are%20working%20women%20doing%20during%20covid%2019/womeninworkplaceherofullcol12201711191536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Our Publishing,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-are-working-women-doing-during-covid-19-our-women-in-the-workplace-study-explores,"How are working women doing during COVID-19? Our Women in the Workplace study explores. September 30, 2020 Today we release the 2020 edition of Women in the Workplace , the largest study of the experiences of women and gender inequality in corporate America. Produced in partnership with Lean In , the annual report, published since 2015, analyzes workplace data and the experiences of men and women from the previous year. The team began working on this year’s report before COVID-19. While the pipeline data reflect the end of year 2019 and predate the pandemic, the team pivoted quickly to ensure the final output would be relevant. “We rewrote our entire HR and employee surveys this past spring to best reflect the impact of the crisis on women so far,” says Jess Huang, a McKinsey partner and co-lead of the Women in the Workplace research. She explains that the longitudinal nature of the study will be particularly helpful next year. “Knowing that many companies made structural changes during and post-pandemic, we’ll be able to assess the impact on the pipeline,” she adds. We spoke with Jess on what the biggest takeaways are from this past year’s findings are. Here’s what she had to say: Women could be leaving the workforce more than men Every year since 2015, women and men at every level have considered leaving and actually left their companies at comparable rates. But the pressures of COVID-19 and the new work environment have completely changed that landscape. “It’s been surprising to see how many women are having such a difficult experience that they are considering stepping out of the workforce or switching to less demanding jobs,” says Jess. Women are 1.3 times more likely than men to have considered stepping out of the workforce or slowing down their careers—particularly mothers, senior women, and Black women. In the worst case scenario, if women leave the workforce at the rates they say they are considering, corporate America could lose over two million women in the workforce—more than the number of women who graduate from college and graduate programs in the US each year—and over 100,000 women in senior leadership roles in the short term. “This could potentially wipe out the progress we've made over the last six years,” she adds. Mothers, Black women, and senior women are feeling it the hardest Working mothers absorb a disproportionate amount of childcare and homeschooling responsibilities, and that double shift has grown to a “double double” shift. Mothers of children under age 10 who are in dual-career couples are twice as likely as men in the same situation to spend more than five additional hours a day on household responsibilities than they did prior to COVID-19. Meanwhile, one in four senior women has considered stepping out of or slowing down in their careers. “This is particularly concerning given senior women can have an outsized impact on diversity and inclusion at their companies,” says Jess. “Part of the reason they may feel so exhausted and always on is because they are more likely than senior men to champion diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and act accordingly,” she adds. “They are also more likely to mentor or sponsor women of color.” Black women are facing additional unique challenges from both COVID-19 and recent events of racial injustice.  They are three times more likely than non-Black women to report the death of a loved one as a recent challenge. “It’s critical that allyship — coupled with action — becomes part of the answer here,” Jess adds.  Our data show that while over 60 percent of employees consider themselves to be allies to women of color at work, relatively few take consistent action. Women in the Workplace Companies need to rethink work norms Next year’s pipeline data will show the impact of COVID-19 on women’s representation — both in terms of decisions companies have made in reorganization and potential attrition due to women stepping out of the workforce. Every year our firm has conducted this research, we’ve seen that attrition is not a driver in the difference between men and women’s representation, but this could be different next year, possibly as a result of the shift to remote work. “We’re really at a crossroads right now,” Jess says. “The data tell us that while there are some benefits to remote work, employees are also dealing with financial uncertainty, burnout, and mental health issues.” As a result, certain groups are really struggling, like working moms, Black women, and senior women. Companies are at a place where they need to be deliberate about redesigning this new workplace or else risk losing the women who are struggling the most. Work-life flexibility was the number one issue raised by survey participants regarding workplace inclusion by women and men last year. In fact, companies anticipate that increasing flexibility could allow them to better attract and retain diverse talent across different geographies. “This means rethinking some previous workplace norms,” says Jess, “such as what productivity looks like, or supporting employees’ mental health, or fostering inclusion in a remote setting.” Never miss a story"

What does that mean, and what do these companies have in common? In a recent webinar hosted by McKinsey, Reid Hoffman , co-founder of LinkedIn and partner at venture capital firm Greylock, and Chris Yeh , co-founder of the Global Scaling Academy, offered insights. They explained that ‘serial business builders’ are organizations that relentlessly come with new ideas and spin them into scalable businesses—businesses that can disrupt entire markets by creating value in radically new ways. Being the first to scale is extremely important. And in times of uncertainty like COVID-19 the ability for organizations to move fast matters even more. Ari Libarikian , a senior partner and global leader of Leap , McKinsey’s business-building capability, and Rock Khanna, a senior partner and co-leader of our Marketing & Sales Practice in North America, led the discussion with Hoffman and Yeh on blitzscaling , a phrase the two use to describe the set of practices that enable companies to rapidly grow and beat competitors. The importance of speed and innovation is something we've also seen in our own work with clients. “The companies that have stayed at the top for decades are always regenerating,” says Ari. “They’re finding new sources of value, new sources of revenue, and creating new businesses. This is really a requirement to being successful today.” Rock adds that, even amid the disruption to global business caused by the pandemic, ""we have seen some companies outpace their competitors by acting quickly and launching new products and services in a matter of weeks that have typically taken years."" So how can executives blitzscale their organizations? Below are four tips from Hoffman and Yeh. 1. Act fast Speed matters. Now is the chance for businesses to make fast moves, and being first counts. This means prioritizing speed and deciding which actions must be taken now versus what can wait for later. Speed, after all, is relative to what the competition is doing. Today, technology is enabling every company to move with even greater speed. Elsewhere, markets are more global and hyperconnected, creating greater opportunities to blitzscale. Leaders should know blitzscaling only lasts a finite period: Only when competitors can no longer catch up should they stop. Blitzscaling: Business-building with speed and agility 2. Embrace smart risk Every good strategy involves risk, but it’s important to manage that risk as you go. Leaders must be willing to make and survive mistakes, learn from them quickly, change their minds, and embark on an ongoing learning journey. Decide which risks matter and should be taken, and use data from previous experiments to shape strategy. Uncertainty is a core part of innovation. Before doing anything, leaders need to establish a marketplace, market fit, and accept uncertainties. 3. Hire for adaptability People typically focus on financial capital at the expense of human capital. Yet it’s largely human capital advantage—people with experience growing companies from the ground up—that makes companies successful. Getting the right entrepreneurial people in at the right phase of a business is key. This means hiring in those employees who understand change is afoot and may not necessarily stay with the company forever. Hire who’s right for the role right now, not right for later. Make it clear what their specific mission is and what constitutes success. 4. Focus on winning First, determine where you stand next to others in the market and how that fits into your business model. As people navigate the ongoing pandemic, there’s an even greater need for flexibility and adaptability to move from survival to growth mode in order to leapfrog the competition. While the ability to scale quickly is often triggered and enabled by technology, it’s not always the case. Competitiveness of another player, for example, can also be an impetus to scale fast. No matter how analog or old-school a company, whenever there’s a chance for a winner to take most of the market, there is reason to rapidly business-build.

To help recent grads and summer interns navigate this moment and prepare for the next normal, our publishing team has collected our best thinking on thriving in the workplace into a single guide . “We had never done this before,” explains Mike Borruso , a McKinsey executive editor. “Young people graduating from college or starting their first internship are now finding themselves in a very strange time, and we wanted to welcome them to the world of work with some helpful information.” The idea was hatched as many students were heading into finals and graduation season. In the spirit of the firm’s new agile publishing model, which has produced hundreds of coronavirus-related articles since March, the team pulled together the collection within 48 hours. The articles, videos, podcasts, and other material we’ve put together will be helpful to anyone entering the world of work for the first time. “We went through all of the firm’s most popular insights content from the past few years, which includes hundreds of interviews with executives of well-known organizations,” Mike says. “The articles, videos, podcasts, and other material we’ve put together will be helpful to anyone entering the world of work for the first time.” Chris Konnari , who heads the firm’s web-production team, organized the material and laid out the page, and designer Nathan Wilson provided guidance on art. Our new manager of social-media content, Mona Hamouly , worked with Steve Lackey from our media services team to come up with a fun and creative video to promote the page on social platforms. The resulting collection includes 41 articles and 16 video interviews with leaders from organizations such as Girls Who Code, Pixar, Starbucks, and water.org. Some of the pieces cover pragmatic topics, such as making good decisions, running better meetings, managing time well, building great teams, and more. Other pieces, meanwhile, explore more theoretical questions: What is the meaning of work? What does it take to lead? How does your work contribute to society, and why does it matter? A number of the pieces in the collection were published in our pre-pandemic past. All of them have been added to the guide for the way they can help new workers thrive in a post-pandemic future. For example, AI, automation, and the future of work offers a bird’s eye view of how these technologies will reshape the labor market over the next ten years. The future is not what it used to be offers a vision of life and work after COVID-19.

As consumers demand virtual, customized, and sustainable products and services against a rapidly shifting economic backdrop, organizations are looking for insights that can help them capture more value in procurement, and even position the function as a source of competitive advantage. A new approach to digital procurement—Orpheus, a McKinsey company In early February 2020, we announced the acquisition of Orpheus GmbH, a leading provider of spend-analytics technology and a recognized innovator in digital procurement. We have now launched Orpheus, a McKinsey company, a new service that combines Orpheus’ advanced platform technology with McKinsey’s industry expertise and content-rich services in digital procurement. According to those closest to the acquisition, the new offering will help revolutionize certain aspects of the procurement process and give organizations a new way to create value. “We’re changing how organizations optimize procurement,” says Bill Wiseman , a senior partner in McKinsey’s Operations Practice. “The new combination of McKinsey expertise and insights with a world-class technology platform is unique in the industry.” According to Bill, we’re also changing the way we deliver that service. We’ve created a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that lets clients choose from a palette of options in creating a unique solution that suits their specific requirements. Whether it’s a building a one-off spend cube based on software licensing, or launching a full-service engagement incorporating spend-data processing, actionable insight services, and program management, the hybrid model allows clients to choose the exact level of service they need. “That flexibility,” Bill adds, “will allow a much broader range of organizations to access our benchmarking information—an exciting shift for both us and our clients.” The new offering also frees up capacity to focus on what matters most. “We’re going to be able to spend more time with clients on ideation, driving change, and actually delivering impact, while offering faster and better data analysis,” says Bjorn Uwe-Mercker , a partner in our Operations Practice. “And that will free up clients’ time to pursue other value-added activities. While we take care of the analytics and insight generation, users will be able to bring the human element to the fore and focus on negotiation and implementation, rather than crunching numbers.” We’re changing how organizations optimize procurement. The new combination of McKinsey expertise and insights with a world-class technology platform is unique in the industry. Orpheus’ CEO Jörg Dittrich and COO Michael Lauer were instrumental in making the acquisition a reality. They saw that the combination of our consultants’ expertise and Orpheus’s market-leading software could help create the future of digital procurement. “We couldn’t be more excited to be working together to make that future a reality,” says Jörg. As Pieter points out, that reality will be anything but dull. “We’re redefining a complex, underestimated, and undervalued discipline of procurement excellence,” he says, “and transforming spend analytics into an exciting and high-value activity.” Never miss a story"

December 4, 2019 The winner of the 2019 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award is an investigation into how a gender gap in data perpetuates disadvantages for women across the world. Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men , by journalist and activist Caroline Criado Perez , delves into the ways data collection systematically ignores half the world’s population. McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader and Financial Times editor Lionel Barber presented the award on Tuesday, December 3, at the Park Hyatt Hotel in New York. Verizon CEO Ronan Dunne sat down with Barber for the event’s keynote interview. In the book, Criado Perez investigates the shocking root causes of gender inequality. Informed by hundreds of studies in the United States, the UK, and around the world, Invisible Women reveals a dangerous pattern that lurks in data and lays bare the consequences it has on women’s lives. “Unassailable facts, backed by powerful stories, are what move minds,” said Kevin. “This year’s winner brilliantly uses that combination to cast a bright light on one of the most important issues of our time.” The judging panel spent Monday deliberating the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. In addition to Lionel Barber, who chaired the group, this year’s judges included Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman at Mozilla; Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz; Herminia Ibarra, professor of organizational behavior at London Business School; Randall Kroszner, professor of economics at University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Dambisa Moyo, global economist and author and non-executive director at 3M Company and Chevron; Shriti Vadera, chairman of Santander UK and independent director of BHP Billiton; and Rik Kirkland, partner, global publishing at McKinsey. “ Invisible Women is a stunning book that tells people about sexism that is hidden in plain sight,” added Lionel Barber. “The data that Criado Perez marshals are overwhelming, and her call for action is compelling.” The Bracken Bower Prize for 2019’s best business book proposal by an author under 35 was also awarded on Tuesday night. The winner was Jonathan Hillman for The Sinolarity , which the judges called “a thought-provoking and topical analysis of the battle between the US and China for control over tomorrow’s technology and networks.” This marked the 15th year of the FT and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award. Given annually to the book that provides “the most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues,” the prize has shortlisted 88 books since 2005 that comprise a thorough overview of business in a tumultuous era.

According to global communications partner Steve John , our new visual identity is one example of how we’re taking our own medicine on that front. “We’re not the same firm we were even five years ago,” says Steve. “Experts in artificial intelligence, data science, and design of all sorts have joined McKinsey to deliver change that matters to our clients. Updating our visual identity was an effort to better align our firm’s look and feel with who we are now, and we’re humbled by Red Dot’s recognition of that work.” Director of brand communications Jane Goehring agrees. “What’s special about our firm is the combination of old and new: our heritage, which is rooted in our mission and values, and all of the new ways that we can help our clients create and sustain meaningful change,” she says. “Our new identity reflects that tension by embracing the idea of ‘high contrast’; which helps us cut through, and focus on what matters most.” The Red Dot Award , which works “in search of good design and creativity,” is one of the largest design competitions in the world and perhaps the most prestigious. For the Brand & Communications competition, 24 international design experts viewed and evaluated almost 9,000 entries from around the globe. Updating our visual identity was an effort to better align our firm’s look and feel with who we are now… The new McKinsey visual identity work has been overseen by our firm’s chief reputation officer Peter Dahlstrom and led internally by Steve, Jane, design director Elliot Cravitz , and brand communications managers Kevin Drennan and Lana Markovic , working in collaboration with brand consultancy Wolff Olins and the branding and creative agency OPX . Its most prominent components feature an updated script mark, a new graphic element we call the Partnership Mark, a bespoke typeface, a high-contrast color palette, and a revamped approach to data visualization and photography. This year’s Red Dot Award winners are invited to attend the annual awards ceremony in Berlin at the end of the year.

The ABCs of McKinsey Design,"See the original art dozens of designers from across our firm submitted for 36 Days of Type, a global creativity challenge.",2019-05-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20designers%20participate%20in%20instagram%20typography%20challenge/blog-instagram-thumbnail_1536x864.jpg,"Digital,Design",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-abcs-of-mckinsey-design,"The ABCs of McKinsey Design Numerals 3, 4, 5, and 6 by McKinsey designers for 36 Days of Type May 16, 2019 This is a short story about a project that was just our type. It all started when two graphic designers from Barcelona created a daily creativity exercise that became 36 Days of Type , a global design challenge that now partners with Adobe . This year, the project asked designers everywhere to come up with visual interpretations of the letters A through Z, and the numbers 0 through 9, and share them on social media between April 2 and May 8. The project caught the eye of Rob Mathis , a communications head with McKinsey Design . “We really felt this would be a great chance for us to showcase the range of McKinsey’s design talent and creativity,” says Rob. “We also thought our colleagues would have a ton of fun with it.” So, Rob put out a call for submissions, asking designers to loosely follow the McKinsey color palette so that all 36 characters would look cohesive together. But beyond that, people were free to do as they saw fit. “Our designers are often creating solutions within any number of constraints,” says Rob. “This project was more of a blank canvas, allowing them to show off their artistic sides. It’s fascinating to see the various ways each designer approached the challenge, and how unique and distinctive all of their output has been.” Almost 50 designers and graphic artists from across the firm, including client and non-client facing colleagues alike, volunteered to submit artwork. You can see all of their pieces right now, along with captions explaining their process or inspiration, at McKinsey Design’s Instagram account . Some of the illustrations are animated, like Senior Product Designer Kazumi Terada ’s stop-motion, claymation 9 that concluded the series. “The ‘professional art materials’ I had long ago in art school are gone and I’ve been mostly absent from making art,” Kazumi wrote in her caption, “but I am now surrounded by ‘kid art supplies’ like Play-Doh and toy pizza making tools.” Elsewhere, Design Lead Mohamed El Abbassi created a sharp, computer-animated M (for McKinsey, naturally). “M as in Motion, a medium we use to tell stories, present concepts, and showcase complex ideas,” Mohammed wrote in his caption. “Motion involves timing and spacing, rhythm and pace, a connected path that leads the eye and talks to the mind.” Others, meanwhile, took simpler routes. Yin Thum , a Junior Designer with McKinsey Digital, used a photograph of a pencil shaving for P . “P for ‘Pencil’ and ‘Paper,’” Yin wrote, “the simplest, most powerful tools anyone can use to ideate and create.” Earlier in the series, Lead Interactive Designer Megan Dweck produced a luminous, almost Yves Klein-blue I . “I for ink. I for idea. I for inspiration,” she wrote. “Design itself is a fluid process—you might start with a structured idea, but the creative journey leads you to a result you probably didn’t expect.” And Melanie Carnsew, a designer with our Brand Communications team, created a Rorschach-like image of a Q by splattering black ink against a cutout stencil on white newspaper. “How do you question?” asked Melanie in her caption. “No matter, just keep questioning.” This project made clear that creators of all kinds, both at our firm and beyond, are eager to answer that call.

Three solutions to watch in 2019,"Our three solutions focus on cybersecurity, organizational structure and real estate value – all intrinsic to strong business performance.",2019-01-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/3%20solutions%20to%20watch%20in%202019/3solutions-hero-wide_v2_1536x864_3.jpg,"Solutions,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/3-solutions-to-watch-in-2019,"Three solutions to watch in 2019 OMNI uses geospatial analytics to help retailers understand shopper behavior inside the store—and out. January 20, 2019 Solutions are the technology tools we have developed to help our clients analyze, benchmark, and use data in new ways. Over the past ten years, we’ve developed a range of solutions across industries and business functions, and as we start 2019, we believe that three of them may be particularly relevant to clients this year. From agile organizations to cybersecurity to retail channel planning, these solutions can provide insights that help our clients make more informed decisions. Two are used to diagnose organizations, evaluating structure and security, and the third helps retailers and other businesses maximize the economic value of their real estate. OrgLab: capturing an amoeba If an organization chart depicts the structure of a company, what does it look like when the organization is fluid, with three quarters of its employees rotating among teams? “Like an amoeba,” laughs Carolyn Pierce , director of product management. “‘ Agile organizations ,’ with flexible teams, will be the dominant new way of operating—so it makes sense that OrgLab reflects this.” OrgLab is our solution that helps organizations visualize their structure—and is often the first step when a company reorganizes, acquires a business, or undertakes a transformation. When introduced in 2014, OrgLab depicted organizations as boxes and lines in a hierarchy of reporting relationships. In 2019, OrgLab is being refined to depict organizations by the way the work gets done: through teams, by projects. It will help companies evaluate whether their teams are the right size;  do they have effective structures and skill sets; and leaders who are performing well. OrgLab also depicts processes: visualizing work flow and decision points. “If my most important activity is onboarding new customers, OrgLab can help me see where key decisions are being made,” explains Ashwin Acharya , senior solution leader. “Are they happening in sales? Finance? How many layers do they go up? How quickly do decisions happen?” Having served more than 300 clients in the last 3 years, OrgLab often provides a first-time, bird’s-eye view of an organization to its senior leaders. In 70 percent of our projects, they are surprised by what they learn, says Ashwin. For example, a large financial-services company discovered that it had more contractors than employees. A telecom found that 10 percent of its senior management reported to peers. A bank was overcounting its employee population by 20 percent. The OrgLab team today, part of McKinsey’s larger Organization Practice , has 40-plus people: software developers and data scientists who  create the product; org-design experts who scope, problem solve, and run client projects; and coaches and specialists who load and run data and train clients. They estimate that 20 percent or more of their work this year will focus on helping companies convert to agile methods. “Reorganizations take a long time. By the time you complete one, you need to start all over,” says Carolyn. “""If you do an agile transformation, it’s the last reorganization you'll have to do.” Cybersecurity:  first things first Cyberattacks, once a threat to financial firms and governments, are now universal, affecting any business that’s digital and connected to the internet. So it’s not surprising that cybersolutions are on our list for the second year in a row, this time, specifically, Digital Resilience Assessment . “In 2018, we have seen attackers become increasingly sophisticated, regulators laser focused, and companies becoming more stringent with their suppliers,” observes James Kaplan , a partner. “Cybersecurity has gone beyond being a technical issue to become organizational in nature. Eighty percent of what you need to do is outside the CEO’s office and integrated into basic processes.” This 360-degree benchmarking diagnostic scans a company, pinpointing vulnerabilities across seven areas. It answers questions such as: Once the assessment is complete—it typically takes a week or so—we can help the company put a plan into place, from securing data to investing in the cybersecurity market. The team has grown from zero to 50 in 2 years, and it brings together a mix of deep industry expertise and proven risk experience across a wide variety of scenarios. We expect growth to keep to the same pace in 2019. “Every company today wants to become digital, to use data and analytics in strategic ways. As a first step, you need the confidence that comes from effective cybersecurity—built into a product’s specs,” says James. “No cybersecurity, no digital, no innovation.” OMNI: retail therapy for an omnichannel world The “retail apocalypse” rolled through 2018, with nearly 5,000 stores closing—many of them well-known names—and it will continue through 2019. While retail networks may be shrinking, physical stores, in some form or other, are here to stay. Often they are evolving to new identities as product showrooms, “brand experiences,” service centers, or fulfillment locations. This evolution, paired with the fact that many digitally native brands, such as Amazon and Casper (mattresses), are building physical stores, means that traditional “four-wall metrics” of sales and profit will become increasingly irrelevant. Our OMNI solution builds on more than a decade of geospatial-analytics work and helps businesses fundamentally change the ways they think about, and operate, their sales channels—including decisions about their physical footprint. The solution incorporates large data sets in new ways to calculate interactions between channels, quantifying the “halo effects” that strongly influence the economic value of a store, adding or detracting up to 20 percent of its sales. OMNI integrates traditional geospatial data—such as demographics, mobile-phone foot traffic, and competitor locations—with internal business data. It is all fed through customized machine-learning models to uncover the factors that are driving performance in each channel, quantify how channels are interacting at a hyperlocal level, and help create the optimal cross-channel footprint for each market. “Retailers can make informed decisions about where to put stores, which formats to choose, how to use the stores to drive online sales, and even all the way down to fine-tuning store categories to meet the demand for that particular consumer base,” explains Nathan Uhlenbrock , a geospatial-analytics expert. “It’s become increasingly important be able to quantify channel interactions (owned and third party) at the micromarket level. We have a number of powerful use cases, including optimizing a store network, recapturing volume from store closures, and improving personalization,” explains Kelly Ungerman , a McKinsey partner. Looking ahead to 2019, she says, “We’re a global capability, and we completed dozens of projects in 2018, ranging from 1-week sprints to 6-month transformations. Every retailer faces these challenges, and few know how to tackle them—but those who do will win.” related Three breakout solutions of 2017 How to protect your business from a cyberattack Never miss a story"

There’s a playbook for bringing out the best in people, a sports page-turner about a data-driven underdog victory, and a humorous look at strategies gone awry. Talent Wins by Dominic Barton, Ram Charan, and Dennis Carey Dominic Barton, our former managing partner, made a habit of meeting with two CEOs or leaders almost every day for 9 years. “Knowing what you know now,” he’d ask them, “what would you do differently?” “Spend more time on talent,” was an almost unanimous answer and the inspiration for this new book, Talent Wins: The New Playbook for Putting People First (Harvard Business Review Press, March 2018). It lays out seven steps for managing people in a world that runs on gigs, works in real time, shifts shape regularly, and is digital, analytical, and technology driven. These steps include creating a troika of an HR leader, along with the CEO and CFO to lead the organization; focusing on the 2 percent of people who create the most value; and making people decisions based on data. The book follows up each step with real-life examples: Haier, a Chinese white-goods manufacturer, flattened itself into 2000 micro-innovation units, and Telenor, a Norwegian telecom giant, is boosting its tech-oriented senior leadership from 5 to 50 percent. The bottom line? It’s all about the people. Astroball by Ben Reiter, senior writer, Sports Illustrated Astroball: The New Way to Win It All (Crown Archetype, July 2018), is a gripping tale with two sets of winners: the losing baseball team that became a champion, and the data-quant team that helped it win. It’s the behind-the-scenes story of how Jeff Luhnow—a McKinsey alumnus (Chicago office, 1994 to 1999) and now general manager of the Houston Astros—and his group of data scientists used analytics to guide the team’s amazing turnaround. In a scant 3 years, the Astros went from the “worst team in half a century” to become the winner of the World Series in 2017. The book chronicles their efforts to quantify the human factors in scouting, coaching, and playing, and how they worked to combine hard stats with gut instincts. It’s also a story of building an analytics program from the ground up, changing the culture of a fluid and complex organization, and managing devastating crises, including a hack and hurricane, with lessons for all types of organizations. Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick by Chris Bradley , Martin Hirt, and Sven Smit It’s happened time and again: executives carefully put together a bold, thoughtful strategy that will catapult their company from the middle of the pack into the lead. The strategy incorporates market dynamics, creative thinking, and factual data. They walk into a meeting room to start galvanizing their team—a group of people with their own agendas, territories, and biases. Six months later, the strategy has been whittled down to a series of action points. But one in 12 companies do succeed in becoming leaders. Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick: People, Probabilities and Big Moves to Beat the Odds (John Wiley & Sons February 2018) outlines how the winners deftly manage the “social side” of strategy—organizational dynamics—so that they can effectively make the big strategic changes their company needs. It’s the first strategy book to wed behavioral psychology and data analytics. Best of all, it captures the painful moments everyone will recognize—in sharp and poignant, but very funny, cartoons.

The new analytics translator: From big data to big ideas,An expert in business. Fluent in analytics. Focused on results. Every analytics team needs a translator. Here&rsquo;s what we are doing to prepare the next generation for this critical role.,2018-04-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-new-analytics-translator-from-big-data-to-big-ideas,"The new analytics translator: From big data to big ideas Prudencio Pedrosa Grandes , a partner and the first analytics translator at McKinsey, congratulates Marta Matecsa, an engagement manager, on completing her training and becoming our 1,000th analytics translator. April 20, 2018 Three of the top five “most promising” jobs in the United States this year are high-tech data positions. But  not every role on an analytics team requires a math or science degree. “In fact, in the role of a translator, having a computer background can go against you,” says Prudencio Pedrosa Grandes , a partner based in Madrid who holds degrees in economics and business. He should know—he was the first analytics translator at McKinsey and helped to define the role more than 3 years ago. “I don’t have advanced programming skills. But I think logically and understand how to make analytics create tangible value in day-to-day business—that’s the crux of what the translator does.” In late 2013, Pruden worked on an early analytics project, helping a bank reduce its number of nonperforming loans—and he was hooked. Jump ahead to 2015, and data technologies such as machine learning were gaining traction. As demand for analytics work grew, the need for the role of a translator to lead projects was clear. An early goal was to train a group of some 200 translators, including delineating the role, establishing a learning program and defining a career path. This year, the translator program…with Carnegie Mellon University, will have graduated more than 1,500 translators in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Jordan Levine , a senior analytics learning manager trained in math and engineering, had joined McKinsey in 2011 after a stint in the Marine Corps. He, along with Pruden and Aaron Horowitz , a junior analyst at the time, quickly assembled 30 participants for the first learning program—“We got about 50 percent of the curriculum right”—and they have been refining the training ever since. This year, the translator program, which includes classes conducted in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, will have graduated more than 1,500 translators in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. “Translators come in with a wide range of experience,” observes Jordan. “We teach them a hybrid of skills essential to leading projects with analytics components. This means articulating a problem statement, identifying and collecting data, applying a modeling technique, leveraging the model to influence decision making, and capturing the value from better decisions.” In the classes, students can present use cases they are currently working on. “We’ve seen projects to optimize railroad use, improve the quality of corrections facilities, and even to find the most effective way for power companies to trim trees to reduce outages,” says Carla Vale , who started her career in physics research and now runs the learning program. So what do translators actually do? They have the traditional responsibilities of an engagement manager—leading a team, managing the project, and serving as the key liaison with the client. And they apply their domain expertise in an industry or function, using a deep understanding of the drivers, processes, and metrics of a business to better leverage the data. And, of course, they have a fluency in analytics: wrangling large data sets, understanding the ins and outs of various algorithms and models, managing “quant” colleagues such as data scientists and developers, and knowing how to turn data insights into concrete measurable actions. “Analytics projects are different,” explains Carla. “In other types of work, we talk about the 80/20 rule [the belief that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes], but not in modeling. There is no quick and easy answer—it takes time and painstaking effort to manage multiple, immense data sets. There are false starts, dead ends, and a lot of ambiguity. We have to find new tips and tricks so that translators can help their clients know what to expect.” We developed a model with an almost perfect GINI score…but it was a complete failure… Once the translator and client define which business problem to focus on, they have to identify the data that are the most valuable: “It is like opening a closet in complete disorder,” says Pruden. “We meet with different groups—business intelligence, IT, and sales, for example—to ask about the types of data they have. Everything is in different formats, measures different things, and is sometimes incomplete. What can create the greatest value? Is it usable? Is it relevant? How do we put everything together to build the model?” The translator then needs to know enough about the nuances of various models to ensure that the team solves the client’s problem. Pruden shares an early experience with a class. “We developed a model with an almost perfect GINI score. Data were accurate, current, and clean. It was beautiful,” he pauses, “but a complete failure because the model couldn’t be updated in real time.” Translators then help the client integrate the analytics model and data results into their ongoing processes. One sign of success, Carla points out, “Last year we extended our translator academies to several clients.  They have to know how to use the model themselves after the project is done and our team has gone.” This year, it’s estimated that some 25 percent of our projects will include analytics. Does this mean a promising future for this new role? “For now, yes,” says Pruden. “But the role of translator is transitory—in 5 years, we should all be translators.” Never miss a story"
"After 3 years of tackling youth unemployment, Generation has 15,000+ graduates—and counting","It&rsquo;s been three years since McKinsey founded Generation, a nonprofit focused on addressing the global problem of youth unemployment.",2017-12-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/15000%20lives%20transformed%20and%20counting/generation-tylin_hero_1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Generation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/15000-lives-transformed-and-counting,"After 3 years of tackling youth unemployment, Generation has 15,000+ graduates—and counting Tilynn recently graduated from Generation's retail careers program in Jacksonville, Florida; now she is a mentor for other Generation students. December 18, 2017 When asked to name a Generation student who stands out in his mind, Ali Jaffer, Generation’s COO, has a ready answer: “I just met her this past week.” Tilynn,  a student from Generation’s retail-career-advancement program in Jacksonville, Florida, like many Generation learners, joined the program from a difficult background, after cycling through several temporary jobs without feeling like she was building a career. “She came into our program and did so well and was so motivated,” says Ali, “that she has been hired by the Generation Jacksonville team as a mentor for others.” Even more inspiring is the fact that this isn’t an isolated example—it’s happened with other outstanding Generation students as well. In the 3 years since McKinsey founded Generation to address the global issue of youth unemployment, the independent nonprofit organization has brought new thinking to the workforce development space, graduating nearly 16,000 students across five countries. Many of these students came to the program with hardships that had disconnected them from the job market in a significant way, ranging from long-term unemployment to homelessness and everything in between. Generation is now the world’s largest program that trains and places young people in jobs. According to Generation’s global leader, Mona Mourshed , “Generation is now the world’s largest program, by annual volume, that trains and places young people in jobs.” These jobs currently span twenty professions across four sectors, including healthcare, customer service, technology, and more. Typical roles include certified nurse assistants, customer service representatives, and IT help-desk staff. Most importantly, Generation has developed a methodology and rolled-out a program that has a proven return on investment for both employers and learners—at scale, across a rapidly broadening set of geographies and industries. In the United States, Generation raised $10 million in grant money in 2017. In Spain, McKinsey received an award from Fundación SERES recognizing Generation’s impact in that country, where the program has helped more than 81 percent of its 1,000 students to find employment within 6 months of graduation. In Mexico, Intel has sponsored hackathons in support of Generation. “The more we do, the more we realize how much more there is yet to be done,” says Mona. “With every cohort, we try something new so that we continuously evolve our delivery model.” More countries, more programs After successful rollouts in India, Kenya, Mexico, Spain, and the United States, Generation is poised for geographic expansion in 2018—with confirmed launches planned in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. Discussions are also underway at various levels in more than fifteen other countries. Since this time last year, the number of Generation professions has nearly doubled—to twenty—with another five to ten in the works for 2018. And new partnerships and models are being created as well, with Generation embedding in employers in Mexico and in public-sector institutions in Kenya and India. Generation’s targeted approach Generation trains its learners through boot camps that run between 4-12 weeks, depending on the profession. Programs are heavily focused on the most important activities employees engage in and the curriculum is designed to make sure graduates can perform them at the highest level, starting on day one. According to Lauren Wein, a Chicago-based McKinsey fellow who has been leading Generation’s global curriculum and instruction team since January 2017, “If you look at other programs, they might teach a set of 20 skills you need to do a given job. What we look at are the five breakdown moments that differentiate low from high performers in a specific profession, and we are laser focused on practicing the skills learners need to get them right. This gets integrated into every single week and day of our curriculum.” For example, shift change is a “breakdown moment” for certified nurse assistants (CNAs). Doing this well involves technical skills like taking good patient-care notes, and behavioral skills like showing up on time for the shift, making a plan to see all patients before the shift ends, and knowing how to ask for help in case of questions. If CNAs cannot perform all these activities with a high level of proficiency, they will not be successful. Generation is also rethinking traditional assumptions around predicting a person’s success in a profession, preferring to focus its selection process as much on a person’s innate skills and talents as their educational background. For example, nearly one-third of the students in Generation Spain’s robotics process-automation program have a liberal arts background, challenging the notion that students need a computer science or coding background to be successful at programming robots. “It’s not about the academic background,” says Lauren. “It’s about your ability to show during the selection process that you have the potential to be successful.” And when it comes to skills, Generation’s curriculum reaches beyond the technical skills required to perform a job. “We also address the behavioral skills and mind-sets necessary to build a career beyond an entry-level role.” How McKinsey supports Generation Though Generation is an independent nonprofit organization, McKinsey continues to provide critical support to the program in the form of funding, knowledge, and people. McKinsey colleagues, like Ali and Lauren, can apply for a Generation fellowship, an experience Lauren calls “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a direct and powerful impact by applying what you learn as a consultant to this important global issue.” As Generation grows, so do its internal capabilities—something which inspires deep pride in its leadership. “Two years ago, probably 50 percent of the people in Generation were McKinsey employees donated on fellowships,” says Ali. “Now that number is less than 15 percent. McKinsey consultants are able to lead some of the strategy and business-development areas but also give some of those capabilities and skills to many others who are employed directly by Generation.” Never miss a story"
McKinsey and CEO.works: A new approach to managing talent,"Traditional talent management focuses on the top executives. But as companies realize their most valuable jobs are often dispersed, talent management is taking more of an inside out perspective.",2017-07-28T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Organization,AI & Analytics,Solutions",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-and-ceo-works-a-new-approach-to-managing-talent,"McKinsey and CEO.works: A new approach to managing talent The traditional approach to talent management focuses on the top-level, most senior jobs. But often, the highest value jobs can be found several levels down in an organization, changing the focus from the top down to inside out. July 28, 2017 In many companies, the top jobs sit on the top row of the organization chart. But this is changing. Research has shown that only about 5 percent of the jobs in a company today create 95 percent of the impact. And this 5 percent is different for every company—with key roles sometimes found deep within or on the outskirts of an organization. “To help clients identify their most valuable jobs, we start with their aspiration,” explains Sarah Pobereskin , an associate partner who is helping to develop the new Talent Management service line within our Organization  Practice. “How much do they want to grow? Which markets or products do they want to develop? Then, we can help them define the critical jobs and talent that they need to get there. It’s not unusual for a company to find significant gaps—complete sets of jobs they will need in 3 to 5 years but don’t have today.” To deepen our expertise in this area, McKinsey has formed a partnership with CEO.works, an advisory firm founded by Sandy  Ogg . Sandy has held leadership roles in HR for Unilever and Motorola, and he helped pioneer the concept of linking talent and jobs to the value they create within organizations. “Together, we are helping clients find their very best talent and place them in the highest value jobs— whether it’s one at a time, ten at a time, or a hundred,” explains Sandy. “This can be a source of true competitive advantage.” “Sandy is the person that CEOs and other heads of HR look to for advice on this topic,” says Chris Gagnon, senior partner. “We have been integrating CEO.works’ intellectual property into new tools and methods of working with our clients.” Sarah and associate Rahul Mathew describe helping a major industrial company that wanted to double revenues in 5 years, in part by expanding into Asia, through mergers and acquisitions and developing a digital sales channel. To meet these goals, the McKinsey team identified 35 critical roles, which, if not filled, would bring the business to a standstill. They included content developers, HR business partners, product officers, and service salespeople. “We could quantify the dollar amount of value each position brought to the business—a group of five positions would deliver nearly $20 million. This was an “aha moment” for the company—many of the roles didn’t exist, or were three to four levels down in the organization and weren’t getting the right kind of CEO attention,” says Rahul. The next step was to find the right talent for each role. One of our solutions , People  Analytics , helps organizations systemically and accurately define roles by analyzing publicly available ‘markers’ and data for such positions. The Talent Match solution can then assemble and connect the best talent to each role. “What was once a paper-based process of binders and static Excel sheets is now interactive and data based,” observes Mike Barriere, who recently joined McKinsey as a partner after serving as chief talent officer for Walmart and CHRO  for Alcoa. “Our Talent Match solution changes the conversation. We can see the implications of moving people around in real time, and decisions on candidates are made based on data and evidence rather than on opinions and impressions. And it can surface talent that previously may have been overlooked.” Managing to talent also means changing the way an organization develops and manages performance in those critical roles. Rather than annual reviews and one-size-fits all training programs, Chris points out that “skill building for critical roles needs to be dynamic, personalized, and reviewed at the CEO level.” While managing high-potential talent once meant focusing only on senior executives, now the conversation could be revolving around the talented user-experience designer, the local Indonesian sales manager, or the junior analytics expert.

Long term value: from intuition to index,"For the past 3 decades, leaders in business, government, and academia have debated whether the unrelenting focus on quarterly profits at the expense of long-term commitments has undermined the growth potential of companies and even the economy.",2017-03-17T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,AI & Analytics,Long-termism",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/long-term-value-from-intuition-to-index,"Long term value: from intuition to index March 17, 2017 For the past 3 decades, leaders in business, government, and academia have debated whether the unrelenting focus on quarterly profits at the expense of long-term commitments has undermined the growth potential of companies and even the economy. We believe it has. For years, McKinsey has encouraged businesses to take the long view . It underlies our concept of organizational  health developed almost 20 years ago: if a company manages only for its short-term performance—without minding its health—it won’t last. My ingoing assumption was that there were too many factors driving corporate performance—I was surprised,  in a good way, that we could come up with meaningful results with only five [factors]. To create long-term value, we urged companies to look beyond immediate product cycles and redefine their relationships with their customers, employees, and communities—to solve mutually relevant problems and protect resources. In a landmark 2011 Harvard Business Review article , Managing Director Dominic Barton outlined a road map for shifting companies to a longer-term orientation. We helped create Focusing  Capital on the Long Term , a global not-for-profit coalition which creates practical tools for companies, including a CEO survey last fall highlighting the pressures for short-term decision making. So while there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, it was clear that the best way to advance the conversation was through data. “We wanted to quantify what we instinctively believed to be true,” said Jonathan Godsall, an associate partner. A small team from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) was organized, and in 6 months they  developed the Corporate Horizon Index , a survey of 615 companies’ performance across five key indicators over 15 years. The index provides the first statistical evidence that shows the positive influence that long-term thinking can have on a company’s performance. “The hardest part of our research was looking for the less obvious factors that indicated a short- or long-term orientation. For example, there’s a myth that companies should have smooth earnings growth and meet quarterly earnings consensus. Long-term companies are not concerned with managing short-term earnings and are less likely to consistently hit earnings consensus or to have smooth earnings growth,” explains Tim  Koller , McKinsey partner and coauthor of the bestselling book Valuation , now in its sixth edition. For Jack McGinn, a recent-graduate hire with a degree in applied math, this was exactly his sort of problem solving. “We worked from hypotheses on how short-term decision making would manifest in a company’s financial disclosures. Then we created indicators based on these hypotheses and refined them so they could be applied to companies of different sizes and performance levels.” After conferring with external academics, they ultimately settled on five factors. Our Corporate Performance Analytics team began pulling the data across these factors—and in January, the index was ready. After running the numbers, it was clear that the group of 164 long-term focused companies performed significantly better than those 451 with a short-term lens. Their average revenue and earnings growth were 47 and 36 percent higher respectively, and they added nearly 12,000 more jobs than their short-term peers. Interesting to note, a small number of the companies even shifted from a shorter-term to a longer-term view over the 15-year period. A recent Harvard Business Review piece summarizes the findings of the MGI paper . So what gives some companies the vision and courage to make and stick with their decisions—despite tremendous external pressures? And how can we help others follow suit? We are conducting extensive interviews to understand how companies make decisions and identify the traits of those who take a long view, such as tenure of the ceo; employee incentives; values and culture; and the makeup of the board. “For example, one of the factors we are finding in outperforming companies is that they often set targets using a grassroots, bottoms-up approach—rather than top down,” says Tim. “They benefit from having more balanced view.”  One challenge will be how to get companies to start thinking longer term when they are doing relatively well now and don’t even think there’s a problem.

May 12, 2016 When Korea’s Chamber of Commerce wanted to understand how Korean companies could raise their game, it turned to our Organizational Health Index (OHI). More than 40,000 employees at 100 Korean companies have completed the OHI survey, yielding insights into working patterns, leadership styles, employee mind-sets, and, importantly, differences between generations and genders. The findings could help the chamber recommend ways for Korean companies to improve their management practices, productivity, and business cultures. Although this was the first time the Organizational Health Index had been applied at a national level, more than 1,300 companies around the world have used the tool since it was launched, in 2002. The OHI database holds over a billion data points, drawn from three million surveys completed by employees and leaders at these organizations. This massive data set allows the OHI team to create organizational-health benchmarks for companies in specific industries, geographies, and more. So, in plain language, what is organizational health? “It’s how you run the place,” explains Bill Schaninger, a senior partner in our Organization Practice.” It’s about the basics of what leaders do, how they align the organization against a clear direction, and how well they execute. It’s also about how they renew the organization over time to deal with external forces, such as new competitors.” Bill joined McKinsey, in 2000, after completing a PhD focused on organizational analysis and change. He was assigned to a team charged with finding out why some companies thrived over the long term, while others burned bright but fizzled. The team analyzed corporate performance over decades and across industries, conducted extensive interviews, and reviewed academic research. One basic truth emerged: companies that performed well over the long haul were managed for health as well as performance—their leaders were concerned not only with hitting quarterly targets but also with the organization’s culture and agility. Learn more about The Organizational Health Index The team set about converting these findings into a questionnaire that could measure organizational health and withstand academic scrutiny. The first iteration, designed for an Australian client, ran to 250 questions. “The biggest surprise was it worked right out of the gate. It gave us a pretty accurate picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the organization,” recalls Bill. With further refinements, the team cut down the tool to 100 questions and started using it to help other clients understand and strengthen their businesses. Over the years, the accumulation of data has allowed the OHI team to quantify the way organizational health contributes to financial performance. Healthy companies generate returns to shareholders roughly three times higher than their unhealthy counterparts do. They also identify the management practices that work for them. But there is no single path to organizational health. Instead, the data reveal four main “recipes,” or archetypes—bundles of related practices that increase the likelihood of creating a healthy organization. Companies that stick to a recipe perform better than those that mix management practices from different recipes. Adding further nuances, the OHI team’s recent work shows that the most effective management practices for an organization depend on its health at the outset. For example, the leadership behavior that drives performance in a company at the pinnacle of organizational health won’t work (and could be counterproductive) in a turnaround. The video below explains this data-driven take on “situational leadership.” For most McKinsey clients, the OHI is an annual survey allowing executives to track the health of their organizations over time. The launch of two alternative versions makes the tool available in new ways. OHI Live, now in pilot, puts one question a day to employees, helping a company to capture fluctuations in their attitudes and to track responses to specific events. A subset, myOHI, designed for small and midsize organizations, is available online at no charge as a self-serve platform. The Korea Chamber of Commerce and other projects promise to add a third new option for exploring organizational health: the opportunity to compare companies across a peer group. “If building healthy organizations was simple, everyone would be doing it already,” says Chris Gagnon, leader of the OrgSolutions group. “The work we are doing is needed precisely because it is hard.” Never miss a story"

November 18, 2015 Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots , about the challenges presented by an increasingly automated future, has been named the 2015 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year. Dominic Barton, managing director of McKinsey, and Lionel Barber , editor of the Financial Times and chair of the judging panel, presented the award last night at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York City. “While no one can be certain how the future will unfold, this year’s winner delivers an important message: Companies and governments are racing into a world where both work and the workforce will need to be radically redesigned,” Dominic says. “Rise of the Robots is a tightly-written and deeply-researched addition to the public policy debate du jour and du demain. The judges didn’t agree with all of the conclusions, but were unanimous on the verdict and the impact of the book,” says Lionel. In his acceptance speech, Martin , a founder of a Silicon Valley software company, reiterated his conviction that the rise of robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence were challenges yet to be addressed meaningfully. “We could be at the leading edge of a huge wave. Machines and smart algorithms are starting to become adept at climbing skill sets and beginning to do the jobs of people with lots of skills and degrees. People think they do everything right. . .but they may still find it difficult to find employment. We thought the only solution was more training and education but that may not be so. And it may all unfold faster than we think.” The judging panel spent Tuesday deliberating the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. Judges for the award included Mohamed El-Erian, former Chief Executive of PIMCO; Reid Hoffman, entrepreneur and co-founder of LinkedIn; Herminia Ibarra, professor at INSEAD; Dambisa Moyo, director at Barclays Bank; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Rik Kirkland, our head of global publishing at McKinsey. For the second time, we also presented the Bracken Bower Prize, awarded to the best proposal for a business book by an author under 35. This year’s winners were co-authors Christopher Clearfield and András Tilcsik for their proposal Rethinking the Unthinkable: Managing the Risk of Catastrophic Failure in the Twenty-First Century, which examines how ill-prepared most are to face the catastrophic risks posed by complex systems. In September, 2014’s winner Saadia Zahidi, a senior director of the World Economic Forum, earned a deal with Nation Books for her proposal, Womenomics in the Muslim World about the untapped potential of women in Islamic countries. The Business Book of the Year Award, in its 11th edition, is given to the book that provides “the most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues, including management, finance, and economics.” Since 2005, it has selected 167 books that comprise a thorough overview of business in a tumultuous decade.

Landing LUNAR,The award-winning design firm adds a new dimension to our product development practice and growing capabilities in digital design.,2015-06-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/landing%20lunar/lunar%20136%20864%20box.jpg,"Acquisitions,Product Design",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/landing-lunar,"Landing LUNAR Members of LUNAR’s leadership team at the US National Design Awards Gala accepting the 2014 Product Design Award. From left to right: Mark Dziersk, Gerard Furbershaw, Ken Wood, Jeff Salazar, John Edson, and Jeff Smith. June 1, 2015 It's no secret that design is increasingly a source of competitive advantage and business value. In a world of fierce competition, products, and services that are well designed—working better as well as looking better—have a critical edge. So more than 10 years ago we set out to build a bench of talent and tools to help clients launch new ideas, reengineer products and shape product portfolios. Today McKinsey is the world's leading product development advisory firm. The recent acquisition of design firm LUNAR adds a final, critical component to this thriving practice area. ""Until now we couldn't help clients with design execution,"" says Derrick Kiker, a McKinsey partner who led the acquisition. ""Bringing together top design, engineering, and business thinking in one holistic approach is going to be very powerful."" Creating business value through beautiful, ingenious and charismatic products is LUNAR's mission. Founded in 1984, the California-based company has worked with dozens of leading companies, including Apple, Nike, Siemens, Motorola, and Oral-B. LUNAR recently had to find space in its already over-stuffed trophy cabinet for a 2014 US National Design Award for Product Design, from the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Exploratory discussions about a McKinsey-LUNAR alliance or partnership started two years ago, says John Edson, LUNAR's president. As the two teams got to know each other, a full acquisition started to make the most sense. As you might expect from meticulous product designers, a lot of time was spent sizing-up the cultural fit—and finding it to be surprisingly neat. A quick look at John and Derrick's background underscores this point. One is a former US Navy submariner with a master's degree in design. The other trained as an engineer before taking a master's from Stanford University's joint engineering-meets-design program. Which is which? LUNAR's design team will also find more design practitioners than they might expect among their new McKinsey colleagues, including some leading thinkers in user experience design within our Digital Labs . ""We've been collaborating with LUNAR since 2013,"" says Hugo Sarrazin, who leads Digital Labs from our Silicon Valley Office. ""We've found that the expertise across industrial design and user experience design is complementary. We speak the same language and think about the strategic importance of design in the same way."" There are no plans, however, to move LUNAR's designers into McKinsey premises. In fact, some of our digital designers will relocate to LUNAR's hip digs in San Francisco. LUNAR's offices—in San Francisco and Chicago—will continue to operate at arm's length, serving the company's existing clients while also working on joint projects with McKinsey teams.

So why would a doctor change fields and become a management consultant? And why would a management-consulting firm need doctors? More than 150 medical doctors work in our teams around the world, and the number of medical professionals is even higher if you count nurses, researchers, and other trained medical personnel. Why join McKinsey? For most of our doctors, it's a combination of the desire to help at scale and an interest in institutional change. Alexander Ng, an associate principal based in Hong Kong, was formerly a cardiology trainee treating heart attack patients in New Zealand. To see the same symptoms day in, day out frustrated him deeply. ""It almost felt like you were at the bottom of a waterfall and there's no way you could stop the water from flowing,"" he says. He saw the great need for education and behavior change and decided to pursue a master's degree in public health at Harvard, after which he joined McKinsey. ""The only way you can try to [stop a waterfall] is to dam it upstream,"" he says. Ng now works on shaping healthcare systems with hospitals, payors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations across Asia. For Pooja Kumar, a principal based in Boston, an interest in international humanitarian relief pushed her toward medicine. After working in refugee camps in Azerbaijan and Zambia, she went to medical school and completed her internship, but she came to see medical training as just one piece of her broader interest in global public health. ""Over time, I realized that my excitement and energy for healthcare was really about the potential at a systemic level versus an individual patient level, and that's what ended up drawing me here,"" she says. Kumar joined McKinsey after completing her internship and has worked on a variety of US hospital and global public-health projects. For some doctors-turned-consultants, medicine is in the blood. Jean Drouin, a director based in New York, always considered medicine an option, even though he was also interested in business and international affairs. His great-grandfather, grandfather, and father were physicians. However, before attending medical school, Drouin joined McKinsey for two years as a business analyst. While he loved medical school, he decided to follow his interest in international institutions by completing an MBA and returning to McKinsey. His team works with clients to pioneer the application of technology and analytics in healthcare. Bridging business and medicine One constant for the doctors we spoke with is their ability to bridge business and medicine. Dustyn Baker, a senior implementation coach based in San Francisco and a practicing internal-medicine physician, works on the ground in hospitals across the United States to help implement new ways of working. ""Within a hospital setting, there are so many people to consider,"" she explains. ""One of the advantages of having a physician on the team is that I remember all of those people...I know that there's not just a nurse and a doctor—there's an OR tech, there's a scrub nurse, there's a chief nursing officer. As a physician, I know not only that these folks exist, but also the importance of incorporating their needs and views into any implementation plan we create."" Kumar's medical training allows her to empathize with other doctors and their patients. ""It's unique to have worked in the system, and to have known how frustrating it felt when you were on the ward overnight trying to make a decision about two or three equivalent drugs without the exact evidence about cost,"" she remembers. Drouin agrees. When he interacts with other physicians, they recognize a peer. ""What's been very powerful for us is having a mixture of clinicians and nonclinicians on our consulting teams. Clinicians help build trust."" Learn more about McKinsey Healthcare Systems and Services and Implementation Practices. Never miss a story"
How are women faring during COVID-19?,Two Women in the Workplace authors share thoughts,0001-01-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-are-women-faring-during-covid-19,"How are women faring during COVID-19? In the fall, WIW predicted that 1 in 4 women might leave the workforce or take a step back in their careers—and that we were at a crossroads. We’ve since seen significant women in fact leaving. Does the research and report give us any indication on what is happening? Jess: Last year was the first year in our 6 years of this research that we saw women tell us they were considering taking a step back or stepping out at higher rates than men. It was a big red flag for us, and I think the facts since have unfortunately started to support what we were worried would happen. Our research tells us that unless we are able to help address some of these challenges that women face more than men, the women considering taking a step back or out are likely going to do so. Companies need to act now if they want to avoid losing progress they have made on recruiting and retaining women. Anecdotally, what have you been hearing from clients on how women are faring in the workplace right now? Are there helpful practices that you’ve seen? Jess: What we’ve heard has been very consistent with what the data in our report showed: Women are having a hard time. In particular, mothers are having a hard time juggling additional housework and childcare responsibilities, senior level women are feeling extremely overstretched, and Black women continue to struggle with feeling comfortable bringing their whole selves into the workplace. Eight months later, we are actually seeing even more employees cite burnout as the numbers one challenge. We’ve seen companies really double down on trying to help address these issues—offering additional paid leave days, mandating company-wide days off, and trying to offer more mental health resources. What are some of the questions and topics you’re keen to raise with companies for the report this year? Jess: I think we, like everyone else, are staying tuned to see what some of the impacts of COVID-19 have been, and how companies are thinking about not only the pandemic’s impact on diversity, but also the impact of the return to work–whatever that looks like for them–on diversity. It will be fascinating to see how companies are considering whether or not they are taking into account what this new workplace might look like for women. You’re recruiting right now. What would you say to companies who are thinking about signing up? Jess: I’ll leave this one for Ishanaa since it’s squarely in her wheelhouse. Never miss a story"

November 11, 2014 We recently partnered with the Financial Times to support two book awards: the Business Book of the Year award and the Bracken Bower Prize for business authors under the age of 35. Thomas Piketty won Business Book of the Year for Capital in the Twenty-First Century . Shortlisted for the Bracken Bower Prize were three inspiring, business-savvy women with their fingers on the pulse of global business. The two runners up were Alysia Garmulewicz for 3-D Printing, Anything, Anywhere and Jenny Palmer for One Level Up . The winning entry demonstrated a deep understanding of global economics and gender in a Muslim environment: Saadia Zahidi's Womenomics in the Muslim World . Zahidi points to a disconnect in many Muslim communities between the high enrollment rates of women in higher education, which currently surpass those of men, and a culture that dictates that women must focus on the home. She reveals a hidden history of businesswomen in Muslim tradition, starting with the Prophet Muhammad's independently wealthy wife, who was a trader and completely self-sufficient. Zahidi reminds us that there are more than 800 million Muslim women, many of whom will enter the workforce as education and employment for women become normalized. The impact will be felt not only on the shifting cultural dynamics of the family unit, but also on the labor markets of many countries. Issues surrounding gender, organizations, and leadership in the Muslim world were addressed earlier this year in a report published by our Middle East Office— GCC Women in Leadership: From the first to the norm . Based on interviews with 50 women who are senior leaders and a survey of more than 500 men and women across the Gulf Cooperation Council states, the report focuses on the challenges and opportunities faced by women in the workforce, particularly women in leadership, throughout the GCC—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Find out more about the report on our Middle East office website . The Bracken Bower Prize is named after Brendan Bracken, chairman of the Financial Times from 1945 to 1958, and Marvin Bower, managing director of McKinsey from 1950 to 1967, who were instrumental in laying the foundations for the present-day success of the two institutions.

A clock and a key,"Real estate projects are measured in months and years, not minutes and seconds. But for Sangeeth Ram, the ticking clock is a reminder of the urgent need to provide affordable housing at scale in every region in the world.",2014-11-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"McKinsey Global Institute,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-clock-and-a-key,"A clock and a key Sangeeth Ram’s work in affordable housing is inspired by his childhood experience in India. November 24, 2014 Real estate projects are measured in months and years, not minutes and seconds. But for Sangeeth Ram , a partner in our Middle East office, the ticking clock is a reminder of the urgent need to provide affordable housing at scale in every region in the world. Every day, thousands of families migrate to different cities in search of a better life. Many struggle to find secure or affordable homes. By 2025, one in three people living in cities globally could lack an affordable home. The clock is indeed ticking. A clock Sangeeth understands the urgency at a personal level. Growing up in southern India, his family moved to three cities and five homes before he was 10 years old. His parents, worried that the constant moving would disrupt Sangeeth’s education, decided to take a risk. His father and mother worked for a state bank and managed to secure a loan from their employer—rare in the late 1980s in India—to buy a small plot of land on the far outskirts of the city and build a modest two-story house. There were only two other homes in the vicinity and one kilometer to get to the main road—“It was a desolate place,” Sangeeth recalls. But the family home was a springboard. Despite a long two-bus journey to get there, Sangeeth completed his education at a well-respected local public school. When he decided to pursue his education in the US, but still required money for expenses, his parents were able to take out a loan, using the house as collateral. Besides security, the house gave Sangeeth’s family the confidence and ability to take risks. It gave them an identity. A key After graduating from MIT in 2006, Sangeeth joined McKinsey. In 2009, a real-estate project centered on housing and city development took him to the Middle East. Suddenly, he could connect the dots: “Having this family home, I could see how it changed my life. Wouldn’t it be amazing if McKinsey gave me a broad canvas to shape the thinking on affordable housing?” Affordable housing is now at the core of Sangeeth’s professional practice, working with governments and private-sector developers globally. Wherever he travels, he makes a point of visiting housing projects and speaking to the people who live there. “How it touches individuals is the best part about being involved in this,” he says. “When you go and see the impact, it’s an unbelievable thing.” Yet the challenge is enormous. Today, more than 330 million families globally lack secure or affordable housing. This not only limits individual opportunities but also puts a brake on economic development. A recent McKinsey Global Institute report, Tackling the world's affordable housing challenge , coauthored by Sangeeth, aims to act as a catalyst for change by providing a fact-based framework for action. It offers ways to help build vibrant communities that enable opportunities for upward mobility. Increasingly, land is moving to the center of housing policy; in some cases, it is not about building new homes, but delivering better housing-related outcomes in existing communities. And yes, the key Sangeeth pulls from his pocket really is the key to his childhood home (pictured below). When he thought of sharing his family’s story, he asked his parents to ship it to him. Although his family doesn’t live there anymore, he’s been back to the area over the years. A canopy of trees now shades the house, one of 25 homes in a neighborhood absorbed by the growing city.

McKinsey's Digital Labs sent a team of four twentysomething digital analysts to participate in the first hackathon sponsored by the City of Boston. The challenge? Streamlining the online permitting process for consumers and small businesses. The city processes almost 100,000 permit applications a year—permits to put up walls, to install plumbing, to serve alcohol, to claim a parking space, just to name a few. Each permit application can include up to 40 questions. The hackathon was a way for Boston to tap the tech community for innovative solutions to one its biggest ""pain points"" for small businesses. Ten teams participated in the 24-hour challenge including universities, professional hackers, and enterprise software companies. On the McKinsey team, Christine Miao served as product owner/designer, Catherine Lee was a designer, Matt Casey focused on the architecture and Neil Ni handled the back-end development. When the clock started ticking, most teams dove into the database design and coding. But the Digital Labs team fanned out—and spent 6 hours interviewing the very people most impacted by the onerous permitting process, who had been invited to the event to provide input. They talked to city officials, consumers, and business owners including a burger entrepreneur and the owner of Roxy's Grilled Cheese. ""A rep from Main Streets, an organization focused on small businesses, and a city manager actually walked us step by- step through the process of how they help users applying for a permit—as if it were two people sitting at a desk,"" remembers Christine. ""This was a critical conversation.We then translated their physical process into a digital solution they could be excited about."" The key takeaway from their interviews was clear: citizens wanted a consistent, reliable process that they could use for all of their permits, whether it was for building an addition to a house or opening a business. The team worked through the night and next morning developing their approach, sleeping only 3 hours each. They checked in constantly with their stakeholders for feedback by text, phone, and e-mail. ""The hardest part was knowing when to stop designing and start building,"" remembers Matt. Holistic, 80/20, and integrated ""Our solution was aspirational—rather than fixing the existing process, we created a single set of rules that could apply to most users,"" says Christine. ""We followed the 80/20 rule, developing for one of the most complex use cases—an entrepreneur opening a restaurant—so that what we built could be easily scaled down and optimized for most users."" The approach integrated the ability to identify and apply for the right permit, along with a tracking mechanism so a restaurant owner could monitor the multiple permits he or she would eventually need. They simplified the entire process, whittling 40 questions down to 4. The next morning, the Digital Labs team won both for their category and for the overall hackathon. Would they do it again? ""Absolutely!"" said both Matt and Christine. ""But it has to be the right opportunity. This hackathon hit the sweet spot of what we do at McKinsey in terms of user research and how we can represent data in a new way to solve problems for a large-scale system."" Next-generation consulting The Digital Labs is a new way in which McKinsey is serving clients: turning ideas and strategies into technical applications—fast. Started in 2010, the Digital Labs today has 300+ digital professionals including UX designers, full stack coders, data engineers, and agile experts. They work on a range of projects, from rapid prototyping to building tailored data-analytics solutions. The Digital Labs can also help organizations grow their own agile development skills in-house. They run 24 hours a day, with teams operating in 10 cities on four continents, often handing off projects across time zones to meet tight deadlines. ""Winning the Boston hackathon exemplified the design principles that make the Digital Labs unique…how we think about scalability, the practical aspects from the design side,"" says Hugo Sarrazin, a Silicon Valley-based director, who leads the group. ""To us, success is to make something people want to use."" Learn more about Digital Labs . Never miss a story"

These learning environments help us help our clients build skills through hands-on experience. Now, it doesn't matter where your company is located—with 3-D game technology, our model factories can come to you. ""When we were exploring the idea of building a model factory in New Delhi, India last year, clients were skeptical, saying it would be difficult to send employees en mass for training to the north of India,"" recalls Anil Sikka, master expert. ""Also, would our factory be related to their particular process and industry? We realized we had to find a way to extend our physical model factories to benefit a wider set of clients."" The McKinsey team partnered with Dassault Systemes, a software company that provides process simulation platforms. In 6 months, we developed a virtual model factory using 3-D imaging technology. It looks and feels like a sophisticated video game, but instead of stalking enemies you are tracking down and eliminating bottlenecks, waste, variability, and other impediments to the smooth running of a factory. The virtual model factory reproduces an automotive plant complete with moving assembly lines, vehicles, operators, and robots. It can be configured in numerous ways to illustrate the concepts of lean manufacturing. Participants wear 3-D glasses that are 5-6 times more powerful than the 3-D glasses handed out at cinemas. A big screen displays a scene from a factory showing a particular production problem. Using a video-game controller, participants can walk down the aisle of a plant, approach a machine to closely observe inefficiencies such as a bottleneck, move the operators around on the floor, and balance the work loads of an assembly line. When the lights go up, the group brainstorms ways to make the production line more efficient and then gets to put their ideas into practice in the virtual environment. Did rearranging the order of the tasks across a line actually increase the output? Did changing the roles of the operators accelerate the speed of a line? Which had the best results? Each learning module incorporates insights developed from thousands of McKinsey engagements. Five countries, 10 months, 15 clients To date, the McKinsey team has completed 600 days of virtual-model-factory training—often in very remote locations. ""We were in a desert town in Saudi Arabia, miles from the nearest airport. The training center had few amenities—so we used one of the walls for the screen and black paper to cover the windows...and the show went on,"" laughs Anil. ""The participants had never had an opportunity for this type of learning before."" Will virtual model factories ultimately replace physical facilities? No, because they complement each other. For clients implementing large-scale skills development across a distributed workforce, the combination of virtual and physical learning environments can substantially accelerate progress.

Jeremy Oppenheim, a director in our London office, spent 2014 on sabbatical, serving as program director for the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. The year-long assignment culminated in September with the publication of Better Growth, Better Climate: The New Climate Economy Report , a report that sets out to answer one of the biggest questions facing the world today: Is it possible to combine growing the economy with tackling climate change? The report received widespread media attention—and a shout-out on Twitter from Barack Obama. In many ways, the project perfectly united Jeremy's interests and experience. As one of the founders of McKinsey's Sustainability and Resource Productivity Practice , he understands and cares deeply about the issues. Plus, the commission's mandate was to develop an independent, evidence-based perspective—very much in tune with McKinsey's tradition of intellectual independence and fact-based analysis. ""Climate change is one of those classic arenas where ideology, on all sides, has a bad habit of trumping the facts,"" says Jeremy. ""Even bringing a few salient facts into the debate can be transformative."" As he found out, however, shaping the debate on the public stage is very different from serving clients behind the scenes as a consultant. ""The skills and disciplines you develop inside McKinsey are incredibly valuable—good up-front problem structuring, prioritizing against the big numbers, knowing when 80/20 is good enough, and most importantly, how to build high-performing teams. But the experience was a healthy reminder that so much more is needed beyond expertise or insight. There are other frames of reference—for example, how political deals get done, how the rules of the game get set, how media creates stories, how to use the language of ethics and morality—that matter in profound ways."" ""At one point I found myself on the radio with Naomi Klein, of No Logo and The Shock Doctrine fame. Her world view starts from the need for greater equity and a deep concern for the least privileged members of society. It's enriching to engage with people like her and explore how the market system is more likely to deliver the social and environmental goods which she rightly values."" Would Jeremy do it again? Yes, he would. ""It was an awesome, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to create a platform that, within a year, built enough legitimacy to influence and help reframe the global debate. And it's not every day that you work simultaneously with the leaders of Unilever, the IMF, the Chinese Development Bank, and the International Trade Union Confederation!"" Never miss a story"
The many faces of diversity,Our ground-breaking Diversity Matters report shows a significant link between corporate performance and the gender and ethnic diversity of company leadership.,2015-01-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-many-faces-of-diversity,"The many faces of diversity January 26, 2015 Our ground-breaking Diversity Matters report shows a significant link between corporate performance and the gender and ethnic diversity of company leadership. Fittingly, the team behind the study—London-based partners Vivian Hunt and Dennis Layton, and Atlanta-based partner Sara Prince—brought an incredibly diverse set of personal experiences and professional interests to the research. Recalls Sara: ""When I first started work, as a 20-something year old on a Wall Street trading floor, I was the only person who looked like me."" The experience sparked an interest in organizational dynamics that later led her to McKinsey. ""As a black female in America, I fundamentally believe in equal opportunity, at an inherently moral level. But I started to really question what is the business value of diversity and how do you actually achieve it?"" These are the questions that Diversity Matters starts to address. A sociologist by training (and former military cryptographer), Dennis leads our Organization work in London and has a deep interest in how management practices effect organizational performance. Among his previous research interests: contributing to an international study of the impact of hospital management practices on clinical outcomes. Bringing that same level of cross-border, fact-based rigor to questions of management diversity was a natural fit. Dennis, who is also a leader of Equal at McKinsey , our LGBTQ affinity group, points to some intriguing details among the data. For example, in the US the impact on financial performance of increasing racial diversity was stronger than the impact of increasing gender diversity, whereas the inverse was true in the UK. ""Hopefully we will get people to reflect on what is going in terms of how the dynamics are playing out in their countries. The performance numbers are really a proxy for decision biases and blind spots,"" he says. For Vivian, the research was a chance to further shape the diversity debate, building on the impact of our ongoing Women Matter research, which focuses on gender. As the leader of our London office, she also understands the need to ""walk the walk"" on diversity, keeping a check on her own biases. ""The challenge,"" says Vivian, ""is to manage bias by making the unconscious conscious. Similar to the adage that you can't manage what you don't measure, you can't change what you don't acknowledge."" She adds: ""The single most important thing we want people to take away from this report is that greater diversity on boards and top executive teams helps deliver positive economic performance and organizational health. This is a great breakthrough. For a long time—too long, perhaps—the debate around diversity has lacked economic weight. Hopefully, we've started to reshape the discussion in a meaningful and global way."" Many companies are eager to start the process. Says Sara: ""One of the things that has been interesting to me in this journey is that while the clients that we talked to at the beginning were excited to understand if there was a relationship between diversity and performance, they were even more hungry to understand how to actually achieve it."" The team is already planning additional research exploring the impact of other types of diversity, in more areas around the world—and the best ways for companies to achieve diversity in a meaningful way.

February 4, 2015 McKinsey is widely known for the quality of its training and professional development—it’s part of what motivates accomplished individuals to join our firm. But what if McKinsey-style training could be shared more widely? What if we could offer clients the same courses that help our consultants develop their skills? Welcome to McKinsey Academy . Over the years, clients had frequently requested access to McKinsey training, says André Dua , the McKinsey director who helped create McKinsey Academy. The rise of online learning made it feasible to respond in a systematic way. André assembled a multidisciplinary team—including designers, technologists, and adult-learning specialists—to create our very own digital education platform. McKinsey Academy courses blend video, gaming techniques, and social-media-style collaboration with real-life project assignments. Titles such as “Mastering challenging conversations,” and “Team management, mentoring, and coaching,” indicate that the curriculum is more than academic. “At the end of a program, people should do their jobs differently,” says André. “This is a ‘change how you work’ platform.” To test the market, the team started by offering a digital-marketing course, without using McKinsey’s name in their promotional materials. The response was strong: 1,200 participants signed up. Following further research, two main programs were developed: the McKinsey Management Program, targeted at rising executives, and the McKinsey Leadership Program, aimed at senior-level executives. McKinsey Academy officially launched with its first group of clients in the fourth quarter of last year. “Participants work in small cohorts on assignments and discussions,” says Jennifer Gormley, director of product design. “They offer feedback on and grade each other’s work while getting guidance from McKinsey teaching assistants—motivated colleagues from relevant practices who volunteer their time. It’s like real life, working in teams.” In one exercise, the supply chain of a fictional fast-growing supermarket is contaminated. The team has a week to identify the source of contamination, problem solve, and come up with a plan. Course participants may come from a single company, or they may come from multiple organizations. Many fast-growing companies have a pressing need to develop their next generation of leaders but don’t have the time or resources to invest in traditional executive education, observes André. This is especially true in developing economies where qualified managers are harder to find. What does 2015 hold? “We are seeing very encouraging early results,” says André. “In 2015 we plan to scale the McKinsey Academy platform dramatically and explore new digital learning techniques.” Never miss a story"
Who do you call in a crisis?

Meet our experts McKinsey crisis response, supply chain and logistics experts helped the Red Cross triple their distribution of relief packages in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. February 10, 2015 David Chia is not excitable. ""I have a deadpan delivery—which does not work so well in video or presentations,"" he admits. ""And I'll never be the cheerleader type."" But he is the man you want in a crisis. ""I believe this work plays to my strengths—I am methodical and remain steady and calm when people are overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next. I work with them to regain control,"" he says. Over the past 5 years, McKinsey's team of crisis experts has helped corporate, government, and not-for-profit clients through 50 high-profile crises including epidemics, natural disasters, and catastrophic operational accidents. While the timing of a crisis is not predictable, the way it unfolds is. David and other colleagues help clients understand what may happen next, what issues they need to be ahead of, and, equally important, what they can deprioritize as they struggle with limited time and resources. An Australian with a background in chemical engineering, David held line-management roles in oil, gas, steel, and rail infrastructure before joining McKinsey. He then helped a large energy company over several years to reduce their operational risks. This led to work on crisis response in public health, in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. He worked at the country level to help reduce and manage the risk of an epidemic. ""While the threats are very different [in energy and healthcare], the leadership qualities you need, the capabilities and resources you put into place, and the coordination and approach during a time of crisis are similar,"" he points out. Helping clients prepare for a crisis is very different from helping them respond to one, according to David. In preparedness it can be hard to motivate people to focus on implementation when they have pressing deadlines in their day jobs competing for their attention. ""In responding to a crisis, people often are overwhelmed by fear and unsure of what to do next, because everything seems important. They can't see the forest for the trees because they are in the middle of it. I sit with clients and methodically work out priorities and break them down into small steps. You can literally see them start to regain control,"" he explains. ""As they start to get small wins, the fear subsides and that's the turning point—they can begin to see the clear path forward."" Based in North America, Becca O'Brien Kuusinen has led recovery programs for some of the world's worst natural disasters and public-health threats. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, the most catastrophic natural disaster in US history, swept across the Gulf of Mexico and into Louisiana and Mississippi. In New Orleans, the levees collapsed and the city flooded. More than 1 million people were displaced, and more than 1,800 died, nearly half of whom were elderly people who drowned. Becca took a 3-year leave from McKinsey to work for the US Federal Office of Gulf Coast Rebuilding and then as executive counsel and senior policy adviser to the mayor of New Orleans. ""I got to see the situation from both sides,"" she remembers, ""and I was completely captivated by how hard everyone worked and nonetheless how difficult it was to make progress."" During her 2 years in New Orleans, she and her team helped develop the framework for coordinating the government resources earmarked for the region's long-term recovery. Following this experience, Becca focused her efforts at McKinsey on helping clients think through the issues of governance and operational mobilization during a crisis, how they actually run a recovery and response, and especially how to make sure they bring lessons learned from previous events to bear on the crisis they are facing at the moment. She adds, ""I can walk into the office of a leader who is in one of the toughest moments of his or her life, and say, 'You don't have to do this alone. You can stand on the shoulders of many people who’ve been in this position before and learn from their experiences. We'll face this together.'"" Never miss a story"
A sea change in how we use plastics,"Many environmental issues are so big that no single institution can tackle them. Take the leakage of plastics into the world’s oceans. By 2025, a staggering 250 million metric tons of plastic are projected to be in the ocean unless action is taken.

February 19, 2015 Many environmental issues are so big that no single institution can tackle them. Take the leakage of plastics into the world's oceans. By 2025, a staggering 250 million metric tons of plastic are projected to be in the ocean unless action is taken. That is one ton of plastic for every three tons of fish. Plastic not only harms wildlife and habitats through entanglement with larger pieces of refuse, it also fragments into particles that find their way into living organisms in ways we are only beginning to understand. The plastics found in the ocean come from thousands of sources across multiple countries, so no international organization, government, or company has the authority, expertise, or resources to address this environmental threat on its own. But Martin Stuchtey thinks that the right combination of stakeholders can tackle the issue. Based in Munich, Martin leads McKinsey's Center for Business and Environment , which aims to tackle global environmental issues by working with coalitions to develop a shared understanding across the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. Coalition partners in recent projects include the Ellen MacArthur Foundation , Ocean Conservancy , Rocky Mountain Institute , and Stanford University . Significantly reducing the leakage of plastic into the ocean from land-based sources is the center's next challenge. A geologist and economist by training, Martin leads McKinsey's work on green growth. A particular focus: water management and closed-loop systems. His work analyzing the true costs of how we use natural resources has already made waves. At last year's World Ocean Summit he laid out analysis showing that government subsidies for deep-sea fishing make no sense from an economic perspective because they lead to further depletion of fishing stocks. He has also helped drive work on the economics of the "" circular economy ""—an economic system run, as he describes it, ""like a forest; it grows while other natural systems thrive."" The Center for Business and Environment selects projects based on three main criteria. First, does the issue relate to one of its core themes: the circular economy, the future of mobility, or transitioning energy systems/ecosystems? Second, can the center help bring together a critical mass of stakeholders to take action? Third, can McKinsey use analysis to frame the issues in a way that makes a big difference and helps to unlock a solution? Martin admits that one of his biggest challenges is helping coalition partners and other stakeholders understand the role of the center: ""We are not a nongovernmental organization, but we're also not acting as consultants in the traditional sense. Our aim is to be an incubator of long-term, systemic change."" Says Martin: ""Plastic is a huge, interesting topic. It is the ultimate single-use material. Not only does it clog our ecosystems in very graphic ways but losing a valuable material like plastic after one use is also a huge  loss to the economy. Bringing it back into use is at the heart of the solution."" In practice, this means designing economically viable ways to significantly reduce land-based municipal waste and prevent used plastics from entering the ocean. Creating the right economic conditions will be key so that waste collection and aggregation contributes to local economic growth and job creation. The center aims to lay out its analysis in a way that stakeholders—plastic producers, consumer-goods companies, municipalities, or waste-picker communities—can use as an objective basis for discussion. Then comes the challenge of working with a community of interested parties to develop and implement a plan. ""The real art is contributing McKinsey analysis and problem solving while also tapping the expertise of other organizations,"" Martin explains. Never miss a story"
Celebrating 20 years in South Africa,McKinsey Johannesburg celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2015 with a series of events that bring CEOs and government leaders together with our global leadership.,2015-03-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Offices,Africa",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/celebrating-20-years-in-south-africa,"Celebrating 20 years in South Africa McKinsey Johannesburg celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2015 with a series of events that bring CEOs and government leaders together with our global leadership. March 3, 2015 South Africa in 1995 was going through one of the most profound transitions of the century. President Nelson Mandela had been swept to power in an election that ended centuries of racial segregation. But his government had inherited a stagnant economy with high levels of unemployment and public debt. In business, South African companies finally had access to international markets after decades of isolation. Yet they also faced an influx of global competitors, making modernization essential. It was in this eventful context that McKinsey opened in Johannesburg—our first permanent presence in Africa—with a handful of consultants drawn from our European and North American offices. ""We were crammed into a single office—experienced partners and newly minted associates alike,"" says David Fine, the first South African to join the new operation. ""The sense of possibility was palpable. We were the only top management consulting firm in the country, and we went knocking on CEOs' doors. Before long, we were helping several of the largest companies rethink their strategies and reshape their operations."" This week our Johannesburg office marks its 20th anniversary with a series of events that bring CEOs and government leaders together with our firm's global leadership. There's a lot to celebrate. Our presence in South Africa has grown to around 200 consultants. After sustained effort to transform and localize the office, most consultants—of all tenures—are African. With six offices across Africa—Addis Ababa, Casablanca, Johannesburg, Lagos, Luanda, and Nairobi—McKinsey is helping to propel economic development across the continent. More important, though, are the achievements of our clients. ""Perhaps our biggest contribution has been to help leading South African companies become global champions,"" says Safroadu ""Saf"" Yeboah-Amankwah , leader of our Johannesburg office. He points to our work with one  publicly listed company in which a dollar invested at the start of the turnaround program was worth $500 8 years later. McKinsey consultants have also worked with government departments on everything from industrial policy to public finance, and helped to tackle urgent social issues such as strengthening public education systems and developing strategies to combat HIV/AIDS. More recently, McKinsey partnered with Malaysia's Prime Minister's Delivery Unit to help the South African government launch Operation Phakisa , a high-profile initiative to drive ""big fast results"" in areas such as job creation and primary healthcare. What do the next 20 years hold? Leadership development and capability-building will remain central to our work, as the country shapes a new generation of managers, professionals, and entrepreneurs from all hues of the ""rainbow nation."" The McKinsey Leadership Program trains young black South African professionals in our tools, methodologies, and working approach. Some participants in the 2-year program stay on at McKinsey as consultants, but most go on to key management roles in leading companies and public institutions. Advancing women's leadership is another priority. Lohini Moodley , one of several women partners in Johannesburg, is leading the next phase of our global Women Matter research across Africa. ""We want to inspire the next generation of women leaders with the stories of the pioneers,"" she says. ""We will draw on their experience to understand how they personally overcame cultural and other barriers, and identify ways to address those barriers more systematically."" Says Saf Yeboah-Amankwah: ""Our ambition in the years ahead is to help the next wave of South African companies win on the global stage, and to work with government to achieve excellence in public education and other national priorities. At the same time, we will build a cohort of world-class leaders whose careers are accelerated by their experience at McKinsey."" Never miss a story"

(McKinsey does not take part in the judging process.) Award winners have touched on every aspect of management. A few highlights: in 1974, Peter Drucker won for ""New Templates for Today's Organizations,"" which addressed a need for new organizational structures, but warned against excessive reorganizations as a panacea. In 1979, Rosabeth Moss Kanter's influential ""Power Failure in Management Circuits,"" presented ideas about how power is derived and wielded within organizations. In 1995, Joseph Bower and Clayton Christensen coined a term now firmly established in the business lexicon: ""disruptive technologies."" Other award winners have touched on more personal business concerns, such as John Gabarro and John Kotter's 1980 article, ""Managing Your Boss,"" or Clay Christensen's award-winning article, ""How Will You Measure Your Life?"" in 2010. This year's winner addresses some fundamental questions about capitalism, finance, and wealth creation—specifically, how and why companies use stock buyback programs to deploy surplus capital, as opposed to investing in their businesses. We asked him a few questions. Congratulations on winning the McKinsey Award. What reception has the article received, from business leaders and beyond? ""It's been hugely positive. It's been covered in the Financial Times , the New York Times , and other business journals. Harold Meyerson, a columnist for the Washington Post , says it "" decodes the Rosetta Stone of America's economic decline ."" Elizabeth Warren cited the paper at a hearing on inequality . People who manage money are also concerned about the practice, and I've been invited to talk to folks in the investment world, among other invitations I've received."" ""People have told me it's an eye-opener, people who didn't necessarily disagree, but who hadn't thought of it. That's what's valuable about the article."" ""One of the interesting things is, those that don't agree with me haven't taken it on. Maybe when the prize is announced, some of the people who violently disagree with me—and I know they're out there—will respond. I'd like them to respond."" Are there any business leaders now speaking out on this? ""I have not encountered one sitting top executive of a US industrial corporation who's publicly spoken out against stock buybacks. Either Harvard Business Review has published an article that is wrong—and you ' re giving a prize to an article that's wrong—or people in places in power recognize that there's a problem."" ""I advocate a regulatory fix to stop stock buybacks because business leaders won't regulate themselves. If they would regulate themselves, they wouldn't put themselves under pressure to cut wages or jobs. And that's also how you get effective regulation."" Is this a global issue? Do other countries strike a better balance between the interests of shareholders, executives and employees, in your view? ""It has a tendency to be a global issue. In Germany the board of directors of any company with more than 2,000 employees has to have one less than half of the seats filled by worker representatives and the rest by management representatives. It's a system called codetermination. At one of Sweden's leading global companies there are no stock options for executives. The company adopted stock-option programs in the late 1990s, early 2000s, but they quickly got rid of them."" What are you working on now? ""I'm working on what I call collective and cumulative careers. If we expect to stay in the labor force for 40 years with decent incomes and enough money accumulated to retire on, we're going to have to engage in career-long learning, even if we change companies. In the old economy, once you had a job with a major company, you had it for life. That's not coming back—the world's too competitive and globalized."" ""If people in their 40s or 50s lose their jobs for whatever reason, society still needs them, and it's not charity to figure out how to make use of their capabilities. Society needs to make use of the human capital that these people have accumulated, and these people need good jobs. We have to think about how to preserve and enhance human capital over lifelong careers now that the large corporations are not playing that role. My research shows that it's an economic and business issue."" ""Stock buybacks have business leaders thinking about what I call 'downsize-and-distribute,' or how to extract value from companies for themselves. We have to get everyone thinking about 'retain-and-reinvest,' or how to make use of productive capabilities to create value for companies and society as a whole."" Never miss a story"
A new CEO for McKinsey Social Initiative,McKinsey Social Initiative (MSI) announced that Helene D. Gayle will be its founding CEO.

Photo © Raegan Hodge/CARE March 19, 2015 McKinsey Social Initiative (MSI) today announced that Helene D. Gayle will be its first CEO. Helene is currently finishing her nearly decade-long tenure as president and CEO of CARE USA and will join MSI, the independent not-for-profit organization founded by McKinsey, in July. MSI was founded to develop innovative approaches to global problems. Its unique model leverages relationships across the public and private sectors to create, test, and scale new ways to address the world’s most pressing issues. Generation , MSI’s first program, is a global youth-employment program that aims to connect 1 million young people with jobs over the next five years in India, Kenya, Mexico, Spain, and the United States. Helene brings a deep understanding of how business, government, and philanthropy can shape what’s possible when working on global challenges—thanks to more than 30 years of her work on global issues with CARE USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Helene’s career has spanned from the doctor’s office to the highest levels of international development. As a young pediatrician, she saw how her patients' well-being was linked to wider societal issues and opted to pursue public health. In 1984, she joined the CDC, where she pioneered the domestic and international work on HIV and eventually became the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention; she also achieved the rank of Rear Admiral and Assistant Surgeon General in the U.S. Public Health Service. As the director of the Gates Foundation’s HIV, TB, and Reproductive Health program, Helene continued her work on HIV, funding an HIV prevention and treatment program in Botswana that was the first to show that treatment could reach people even in resource-poor settings. President Obama tapped her to chair the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS in 2010. At CARE USA, Helene has worked with partners in the private sector, governments, and nongovernmental organizations to expand CARE's reach to more than 97 million people in 2014. She’s been recognized by Forbes , Foreign Policy , Newsweek , and other publications as a top thinker and leader. She received the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Humanitarian Award in 2012. In 2008, Helene told Newsweek : “You reach a point in life where you know you may have more years behind you than ahead of you. I want to know that I’m using each day in ways that are meaningful to me. I want to feel that each day is better than the day before and that I’m happy to be waking up and have the opportunity to do the things I do.” When she joins MSI later this year, Helene will focus on building the organization and supporting the growth of Generation. In a world where 300 million young people are unemployed or underemployed and 40 percent of employers say they struggle finding qualified entry-level candidates, the program aims to create a replicable, scalable training approach that demonstrates a return on investment to both employers and young people. The resulting program will be made available to anyone who wants to use it anywhere in the world—to ultimately reach tens of millions of young people. Generation is a natural outgrowth of McKinsey’s work in education and education to employment. Mona Mourshed , who leads our firm’s global Education Practice and spearheads Generation, says of Helene: “She brings a tremendous set of experiences across the public and social space, and so we thought that she would be an ideal founding CEO for MSI.” Generation will operate pilot programs in all five countries by the end of 2015. Pilots launched in the United States and Spain in October 2014. Both feature two- to three-month skills boot camps for young people, including help with supportive services, such as transportation and child care, and mentoring during the first three months of job placement—the make-or-break period in most jobs. In Spain, the first Generation students are learning digital professions, such as web development and digital marketing. In the United States, Generation students in Pittsburgh and Wilmington are training to be certified nursing assistants. While it is early days, the program has already had a big win: 100 percent of graduates in Pittsburgh passed the state certification exam, compared to the national average of 50 percent. In addition, MSI and Generation recently received a $3.2 million grant from Walmart to expand the US pilots into retail professions. In one young student’s words, the program has been “a wonderful stepping stone for a person like me who didn’t have any help. . .this is something to change my life.” Watch this space for more stories about Generation, and follow the initiative on Facebook and Twitter .

A report from the Long-Term Value Summit,"As part of our initiative to help shift capital markets to a more long-term focus, earlier this month we helped pull together a one-day summit in New York. The event drew 120 chairmen and chief executives, chief investment officers, and government leaders.",2015-03-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Global Managing Partner",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-report-from-the-long-term-value-summit,"A report from the Long-Term Value Summit McKinsey’s Dominic Barton (left) with BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s Mark Wiseman at the Long-Term Value Summit. March 23, 2015 As part of our initiative to help shift capital markets to a more long-term focus, earlier this month we helped pull together a one-day summit in New York. The event drew 120 chairmen and chief executives, chief investment officers, and government leaders. I cochaired the summit alongside Mark Wiseman (president and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, one of the largest pension funds in the world) and Larry Fink (chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.) I'll say more about the event in a moment, but first, some background may be helpful. The road to the summit began six years ago, when I moved from Asia to London. I was amazed by the different pressures faced by CEOs in each region. To oversimplify, Western European and North American CEOs appeared to be much more pressured (and measured) by quarterly earnings-per-share performance, while their Asian counterparts appeared to be focused (and measured) more on the value and prosperity they generated over the course of a decade or more. There are clear exceptions in both regions, but the sentiment was clear. Concerned about the impact that excessive focus on quarterly earnings was having on trust in capitalism as a whole, I wrote "" Capitalism for the long term ,"" which was published in the March 2011 issue of the Harvard Business Review . Quite rightly, a number of CEOs (Mark Wiseman and Larry Fink among them) responded that while they agreed there was a problem, what was really needed was an effort to come up with possible solutions. We started working together on developing a rigorous research base, identifying changes we could encourage within our own organizations, and mobilizing a group of business leaders to join us. Our joint research made clear that companies and investors need to balance long-term goals with disciplined short-term action. For example, it took many successful multinational consumer-goods companies between 7 and 11 years to become profitable in China; and 70 to 90 percent of the net present value of the average public company sits in cash flows expected more than three years out. The problem is that our capital markets and corporate boardrooms are excessively focused on the short term—a fact confirmed by a McKinsey Quarterly survey of more than 1,000 CEOs and board members. We found that although here have been some unhelpful regulatory changes (for example, new solvency rules in the insurance sector), the underlying problem is a breakdown of the investment value chain. This value chain runs from savers to asset owners (such as pension and sovereign-wealth funds) to asset managers to corporate boards and finally, to management. While savers invest their capital for broadly long-term goals like retirement, most asset owners parcel this capital out to asset managers, who are usually incentivized on a short-term basis against a benchmark. These asset managers in turn put pressure on corporate boards and management to deliver over the next quarter. In January 2014, Mark and I published a second Harvard Business Review article, "" Focusing capital on the long term ,"" to share this perspective. But we knew that making change happen would require broad support for practical recommendations based on the real-world experience of corporate executives and investors. Working with a group of about 20 senior executives and investors, we started to develop the recommendations that you can now find summarized in our white papers Investing for the future: A long-term portfolio guide , Straight talk for the long term: How to improve the investor-corporate dialogue (available on the Focusing Capital on the Long Term website, fclt.org ), and in our most recent Harvard Business Review article together, "" Where boards fall short "" (January 2015). The Long-Term Value Summit was a chance to debate these ideas and encourage action among a wider set of business and government leaders. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew opened the session by calling for longer-term views and laying out a plan based on trade legislation, tax reform, infrastructure investment, and education. Larry Fink followed with a moderated discussion of his push to encourage boards and CEOs to be more oriented toward the long term. He argued that the media, in particular, play a very unhelpful role here. Next up was Nitin Nohria, dean of Harvard Business School, who led a “fire starting"" session with the whole room, probing what individual CEOs had done to balance short- and long-term pressures in their organizations or how they had kept their teams focused on a long-term ""North Star"" in the midst of short- and medium-term uncertainty. (For anyone who has sat through a Harvard Business School case, it was fun to see some of the world's most successful CEOs being cold called!) The participative approach continued with breakout groups building on the recommendations in our reports and fleshing out actions that attendees could take as investors or as companies. In the afternoon, prompted by the question, “What can we do together?"" we continued in breakout groups to determine how to improve the dialogue between investors and corporates, how to create a long-term ecosystem (inclusive of media, Wall Street, and regulators), and, last but not least, how to drive change. Perhaps most exciting was our final session: a discussion of the commitments to action that attendees were willing to make. These included a chief investment officer announcing that his funds would lengthen the time horizons over which asset managers were remunerated; another announcing that his organization would create a long-term value index to replace its existing benchmark; and a third announcing a change program to retrain fund managers. CEOs talked about ending quarterly reporting, publishing a suite of long-term performance and health metrics, and having more frank conversations with their boards. There was also enthusiasm to continue to work together in small groups of investors and companies to “fix"" the investment value chain. As for McKinsey, we have a role to play here as trusted advisers to organizations and senior leaders across the investment value chain. Whether advising companies on strategy and corporate finance, serving big investors and asset managers, or counseling new CEOs and change leaders, we will sharpen our focus on value creation over the long term. After all, our core mission has always been to help our clients improve their performance in an enduring and sustained manner.

April 6, 2015 If you want to understand how technology is driving innovation and reshaping industries, there's one place you have to visit: Silicon Valley. The 40-mile stretch of office parks and sun-drenched suburbia boasts the world's densest concentration of technology giants, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. ""We get eight to ten calls a month from executives around the world who want to experience the valley,"" says Eric Kutcher , who leads McKinsey's US West Coast region from our Palo Alto office. Our Silicon Valley Innovation Boot Camps are intensive 2- to 3-day sessions that bring these executives face-to-face with innovators who are at once potential business partners and potential formidable foes. Each boot camp typically comprises up to half a dozen executives and board members from a single client company. The McKinsey team puts together a custom itinerary of visits, workshops, and debriefs based on the client's industry and what they are trying to achieve. Michael Uhl, a Palo Alto-based McKinsey partner and boot-camp organizer, points to three key questions that are typically on the minds of participants: Putting together itineraries to address these questions—for clients across a wide range of different industries—requires a broad network of contacts. This is where the collective reach of McKinsey's Palo Alto and San Francisco  offices (60-plus partners and about 400 consultants are split roughly equally between the two locations) comes into play. Clients served from these locations include not only household names but also start-ups ranging from the scrappy to members of the ""billion-dollar club""—start-ups now valued at $1 billion or more. Combined with a community of McKinsey alumni spread widely across Silicon Valley, the network runs deep. Part of the magic is having a critical mass of decision-makers together for an extended period. ""When you put major players in an industry together with major players in Silicon Valley, the thinking evolves quickly on both sides,"" says Michael. Follow-up meetings can be arranged on the spot and pilot projects given a green light. Inspiration can come from unexpected places. Alex Kazaks, a San Francisco-based partner and boot-camp organizer, recalls a recent meeting between the top management team of a big financial-services client and the CEO of a start-up developing middleware for drones: ""Who even knew that drones needed middleware? But it was a great conversation and sparked some serious thinking about how drones could be used commercially in a totally new way."" ""Putting our network to work for clients is what makes the boot camps tick,"" says Eric. ""It shows that there are a lot of different ways that we can serve. Clients have described them as a perfect launchpad for their digital innovations and initiatives."" What does a typical day look like? Like all our client work, boot camps are confidential.

April 17, 2015 Forbes once described McKinsey as a ""CEO launch pad."" At the last count, about 450 former McKinsey consultants were running billion-dollar-plus organizations around the world. Moreover, a quick look at the headlines underlines that the leadership qualities we look for and nurture in our consultants are equally valuable in the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors. Some recent highlights: The list is, indeed, striking. Many of the world's largest and best-known companies—including Aon, Boeing, Deutsche Post, Morgan Stanley, and Vodafone—are currently headed by McKinsey alumni. In the social sector, alumni lead organizations including African Leadership Academy, Ashoka, Cancer Research UK, Hybrid Social Solutions, Joint U.S.–China Cooperation on Clean Energy, Teach First, The Conference Board, and Walmart Foundation and also serve in cabinet-level roles in national and state governments worldwide. What this roll call does not capture is the strong entrepreneurial streak among the community of 30,000 former McKinsey consultants. About one in four alumni go on to found their own company. Apax Partners, DeNA, FanDuel, Gogobot, InMobi, Innocent Drinks, MetaPack, Rocksbox, StubHub, The Muse, Yammer, and ZocDoc were all founded or cofounded by alumni. To be sure, many of our remarkable alumni would have achieved great things with or without spending time at the firm. But we like to think that McKinsey training and mentorship, combined with consulting work on a wide range of business challenges, helped them on their way.

Video games grow up,The leader of our video games practice explains why gaming is for everyone.,2015-04-28T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Digital,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/video-games-grow-up,"Video games grow up More than just a bit of fun: For Jayson Chi gaming is a personal and professional passion. April 28, 2015 In 1973, Atari sold 2,500 units of its coin-operated arcade game Pong . Each unit cost $1,200. Last year, the video game industry topped $100 billion. For Jayson Chi, a McKinsey partner in Hong Kong, what started as small-time hobby has turned into a large-scale professional passion. The head of our burgeoning video games practice remembers playing Pong at the age of four and, when he was six, cajoling his parents into buying an early Nintendo console. Later he would sneak into arcades to play Street Fighter . As an only child growing up in Hong Kong, video games were a good way to make friends. He recalls: ""All my school friends wanted to come over because I had the coolest games."" A fascination with high tech and business led Jayson to Stanford University in California for a joint degree in engineering and management science. When he moved to Tokyo in 2003 to pursue an interest in Japanese media and culture, the gaming bug came back with a vengeance—including a marathon 60-hour session playing Dragon Quest VIII right after its release on PlayStation 2. When he joined McKinsey in 2006, Jayson was eager to serve gaming companies but dismayed to find that the firm had few active clients in the sector. So he took a bold step: writing a turnaround plan for a troubled video game company and delivering it, unprompted, to the company's turnaround officer. It was well received. Introductions and inquiries from other gaming companies soon followed. Fluent in Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, business- and gamer-speak, Jayson was well equipped to help. Many of these early clients operated at the intersection of social media and mobile gaming, a model that served as a blueprint for the free-to-play games now ubiquitous on smartphones the world over. The boom in gaming has not slowed. Today, Jayson and colleagues serve a wide variety of gaming-industry clients, as well as non-gaming companies intrigued by the industry's innovation and growth. Their work for clients ranges from strategy and consumer insights to advanced analytics. ""I am so fortunate to have such a breadth of insight across gaming; I don't think there's a more interesting job."" Back at McKinsey in Hong Kong, Jayson's office is a popular place to hang out for the same reasons as his childhood living room.

Out and proud at McKinsey,"McKinsey's GLBT affinity group celebrates two decades of growth, support, and progress.",2015-05-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/out-and-proud-at-mckinsey,"Out and proud at McKinsey Poznan’s chapter of Equal at McKinsey, including Lukasz and Maciej, during the festivities for Day of Pink, a day for celebrating diversity and raising awareness about bullying. May 8, 2015 The appearance of a poster in an office dining hall in Poznan, Poland, might not seem like the bellwether of progress. But for Lukasz Kozanowski and Maciej Moder, team assistants at our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) service center, the posters represented a monumental step in their personal and professional lives: they were publicly coming out and starting the office's first chapter of Equal at McKinsey , McKinsey's affinity group for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) people. The posters Lukasz and Maciej hung in their office cafeterias in January 2013 invited colleagues to the kickoff event. ""We were nervous because we basically came out to the whole company with the posters,"" said Maciej. ""We weren't sure how we would be received,"" said Lukasz. ""But given the office demographics, we were hopeful."" Taking such a step required courage. ""We sometimes struggle with attitudes toward gay people in our lives outside of McKinsey. We see outdated views on television, on the Internet, and even on the streets,"" Lukasz said. Maciej noticed an immediate change at the office after the first Equal at McKinsey event. ""It's really good when you feel safe and you can be whoever you want to be and know that people will support you."" The start of a new chapter in Poland exemplifies the empowering, grassroots nature of Equal at McKinsey, which is celebrating an important anniversary: the organization turns 20 in May. Its network of GLBT members and allies around McKinsey spans the globe. As of May 2015, there are more than 350 Equal at McKinsey members worldwide, a membership that nearly doubled over the past two years. There are also over 1,000 Equal at McKinsey Allies, straight firm members committed to supporting their GLBT peers, in 20 offices around the world. These numbers are growing every day. Founded in 1995 by John DeVicentis and 13 others (including Brian Rolfes, the last remaining founder in the firm, who is now our partner leading Global Recruiting), Equal at McKinsey began as a response to requests from GLBT recruits to speak with ""out"" firm members. ""It all started with one candidate who asked the right question at the right time,"" Brian remembers. It was quickly understood that for the firm to continually attract top talent, targeted GLBT outreach was critical. Dennis Layton, a principal based in London, remembers attending one of the earliest Equal at McKinsey recruiting dinners: ""It definitely made me feel like I landed in the right spot."" Dennis was recently named one of the top GLBT businesspeople in the United Kingdom by the Financial Times. Equal at McKinsey quickly influenced firm policy as well. In 1997, McKinsey became the first consulting firm to extend medical and other benefits to same-sex couples in North America—and by 2007 we recognized same-sex relationships around the world. More recently, the firm introduced a tax-equalization policy, the first company at the time to do so on a global scale. As of 2014, McKinsey instituted broad transgender health benefits, ensuring any and all medically necessary health care. Thanks to these policies, Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index has awarded a perfect 100 score to McKinsey since 2006. Beyond shaping firm policies, Equal at McKinsey has also created a strong network that offers personal support. Its unique membership structure continues to allow for those considering coming out to have the privacy and care they need as they make that decision. Its global conferences, convened every 18 months, strengthen a growing global community. And local chapters' events and programs offer members meaningful mentoring, recruiting, and professional-development opportunities. ""I think that Equal at McKinsey has an incredible impact on people by helping them be authentic at work,"" said senior manager for Diversity Lori Dobeus. ""The fact that we're a strong, global community, where members can reach out to each other for support, creates unsung moments of accomplishment all the time."" Equal at McKinsey has also had an impact outside of McKinsey. Equal at McKinsey members have undertaken major pro-bono work for the Trevor Project , the Point Foundation , and GLAAD . McKinsey, along with other companies, recently signed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court in support of marriage equality. And Equal at McKinsey has convened a wider network of GLBT executives for leadership seminars in New York, London, and Amsterdam. The network is a step toward addressing one of the questions Equal at McKinsey hopes to answer in the coming years, according to Brian Rolfes: ""How can we bring together the GLBT leaders across different sectors so that they can grow in their leadership potential, as well as support them to continue making progress?"" At its core, Equal at McKinsey's story, much like that of Lukasz and Maciej, shows the power of motivated McKinsey members who want to change the firm and its culture for the better.

No ordinary business book,McKinsey Global Institute directors pen a guide for a disrupted future.,2015-05-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our Publishing,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/no-ordinary-business-book,"No ordinary business book McKinsey Global Institute directors Richard Dobbs, Jonathan Woetzel, and James Manyika celebrate the launch of their book, No Ordinary Disruption, in New York City. May 19, 2015 This month marks the publication of No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All The Trends (PublicAffairs, May 2015), a book by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) directors Richard Dobbs, James Manyika , and Jonathan Woetzel . As the title suggests, the book surveys powerful forces that are transforming the global economy, and argues that we all need to reset the intuitions and assumptions that drive our decision-making on everything from corporate strategy to personal investment. Take a 5-minute quiz to test your intuition about our rapidly changing world Publication coincides with the 25 th anniversary of MGI and brings together many of the big ideas that our in-house think tank has developed and refined over the past quarter century. Inspiration for the book came at a resort on the Malaysian island of Langkawi, recalls Richard. The Malaysian prime minister and the board members of Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the nation's strategic investment fund, were holding a management retreat. McKinsey was invited to outline trends that would shape the world over the next 50 years, over breakfast in an open-air restaurant surrounded by an ancient rainforest. This was strictly a no-PowerPoint affair, says Richard, ""so I needed colorful examples to compete with the monkeys swinging through the trees."" Elsewhere, CEOs had been asking for an overview of MGI's perspective to complement its steady flow of research on topics ranging from globalization to disruptive technologies to obesity. So the project was born—a collective effort to show how the world is changing by combining fact-based analysis with eye-opening examples. As the manuscript took shape it became clear that there was potential for a book-length treatment. PublicAffairs, an imprint of Perseus Books Group, signed up as publisher. The diverse backgrounds of the three authors contributes to the breadth of the story they tell. Jonathan, an American with a PhD in political science, has lived in China for more than 25 years. When not serving clients or engaged in MGI research he is co-chair of the not-for-profit Urban China Initiative—a joint venture led by Columbia University, Tsinghua University, and McKinsey. James, born and raised in Zimbabwe, a former member of the engineering faculty at Oxford University, and long-time resident of San Francisco, has a unique perspective on technology, growth, and globalization. Richard, now back into London after a six-year stint in Korea, is a former leader of our Corporate Finance Practice. The book focuses on four major disruptions: the industrialization and urbanization of emerging economies; the accelerating pace of technological change; the demography of aging populations and declining fertility rates; and increasing global interconnectivity. Each of these trends is larger than any disruption the global economy has ever experienced. Yet all four are hitting at the same time—creating second-, third-, and even fourth-order effects that are scarcely possible to anticipate. What will it take to succeed in this unpredictable new world? The book ends on a positive note. The first imperative for executives and leaders across all sectors (private, public, and not-for-profit) is to maintain an external orientation—that is, don't become so wrapped up with internal challenges that you lose sight of how the world is changing. A second is to be prepared to rethink your assumptions and stay agile, because change will play out in ways that are scarcely predictable. The third is to be optimistic—with three billion people set to join the the global middle class, and technological progress happening at breathtaking speed, there are huge opportunities for individuals and organizations. ""We believe that optimism will still win the day, even in the trend-break era,"" the authors write.

From paper to pixels,The McKinsey Insights app continues our long publishing tradition.,2015-06-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our Publishing,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/from-paper-to-pixels,"From paper to pixels Not-so-distant ancestor: An early issue of McKinsey Quarterly next to the McKinsey Insights app June 10, 2015 Sometimes, the simple ideas are the most revolutionary. Way back when, in 1961, a senior partner named Arch Patton proposed that McKinsey should publish a quarterly journal as a vehicle for its best thinking. Some colleagues worried that self-publishing would be perceived as self-promotional or even (the worst sin of all) commercial. It took Patton three years to convince his fellow partners. When it finally launched, the McKinsey Quarterly turned out to be highly effective. The firm already had a strong publishing tradition. James O. McKinsey , our founder, wrote some of the first books on budgeting and management accounting, and Arch Patton was a fecund writer of articles and books on executive compensation. The discipline of producing a regular journal spurred many more McKinsey consultants to research and write. It also necessitated the hiring of professional editors, which helped set new standards of consistency and clarity. Roll forward half a century and the Quarterly is still going strong. Yet the world—and McKinsey—have changed in ways that Arch Patton's generation could never have anticipated. First, our firm has grown from about 40 partners in the mid-1960s to more than 1,400 today. As a result, McKinsey produces more articles and reports (not to mention blog posts, videos, and infographics) than could ever fit between the covers of a quarterly journal. Second, publishing increasingly is a digital, mobile enterprise. Just like everyone else, McKinsey clients are more likely to be found reading (and sharing) content on their smartphones than handing xerographed pages around their offices. The McKinsey Insights app is our answer to the new needs of our readers: mobile, convenient, customizable, and compendious. It serves up not only McKinsey Quarterly articles but also research reports from McKinsey Global Institute , our in-house economics think tank, and a wide range of materials produced by our practices. What's more, it is available to all-comers for Android devices, iPad and now for iPhone . A few facts about the McKinsey Insights app: What comes next for our publishing program? Beyond creating a more mobile-friendly version of mckinsey.com (watch this space) it's fair to say we don't know for sure.

Giving companies a second chance,Our turnaround experts bring specialist skills and operating experience to companies in distress.,2015-06-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Recovery and Transformation Services,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/giving-companies-a-second-chance,"Giving companies a second chance June 19, 2015 ""My wife is a doctor. She fixes people. I think of myself as helping to fix organizations,"" says Richard Hudson, a London-based McKinsey partner and one of our growing team of corporate-recovery experts. ""Often I'm the last stop before a business fails, and I help it get back on its feet."" Our RTS group was created five years ago to address the unique business, financial, and legal needs of companies in distress. While helping clients turn around businesses has always been a part of McKinsey's work, recovery situations sometimes require specialist skills and capabilities. These might include a nuanced understanding of local insolvency laws and/or the ability to step into an interim management role—becoming a company officer, as opposed to a consultant/adviser. Since RTS was founded, our restructuring experts—partnering with industry and functional experts from across McKinsey—have served clients in 20-plus countries on five continents. ""Restructuring is all-consuming work,"" explains Greg Fern, who held senior operating roles at Motorola Mobility and Sears Holdings before joining McKinsey RTS. ""You have to thrive on change and enjoy teaching people to do things differently. We become personal trainers at all levels of an organization, from the CEO to the front line."" First impressions are critical to gaining credibility, especially when the stakes are very high. ""The magic of this work is you have to go in quietly and prove your value quickly—and then inspire people to change,"" says Richard, whose restructuring experience spans industries as diverse as helicopters and telecoms and countries from Ireland to Greece. RTS specialists help leaders, managers, and employees design and implement new processes, identify and track key indicators, model new behaviors, and motivate people to change. ""One of the cornerstones of effective restructuring is accountability or the 'say-do ratio,'"" says Greg. Weekly meetings with company managers track progress across a raft of operational, financial, and strategic initiatives. It quickly becomes apparent if individuals or departments are not living up to their commitments. Every turnaround has its own psychology and cadence. First comes a ""down into the valley"" phase as managers and employees acknowledge the critical nature of the situation. Then they work together to come up with a plan—""the hope agenda."" In the execution phase, the emphasis is on painting a picture of a better future and recognizing tangible milestones along the way. Then comes the point at which people start to believe. ""You can literally feel the tide turning,"" says Richard. Unfortunately, most restructurings do involve job losses. What is the best way to deliver bad news? ""I think you need a strong fact base&mdmdash;emphasizing that it is an objective decision, not a personal decision. Listen to the other person. Counsel them on what they will do next,"" advises Richard. But while restructuring may require layoffs, the long-term result may be saving jobs—or even creating new ones as a business moves in a new direction. ""I spent nine months helping restructure a mining company that employed 80 percent of a small town,"" Greg recalls. ""The company had job reductions early on...but as we reorganized the procurement group, focused on factors related directly to the bottom line, and tightened up management...people recognized what we were doing would help the company and, thus, the community overall.""

In addition to enjoying some downtime with family and friends, I hope to use some of my vacation to make a dent in my ever-growing reading list. Clients and colleagues have given me many great suggestions of books to read, podcasts to listen to, and summer events to go to—many more than I suspect I will be able to get through. The list below is not exhaustive, but it includes recommendations that have come up a few times or with very high praise and are at the top of my reading list this summer. Non-fiction The Road to Character (Random House, April 2015) by David Brooks Separating “résumé virtues” (our external successes) from “eulogy virtues” (our character and relationships), Brooks challenges us to invest more in the personal qualities that truly define us and less in our short-term advancement. Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 2015) by Evan Osnos From his vantage point as long-time Beijing correspondent for the New Yorker, Osnos provides incisive commentary on life in China through detailed portraits of well-known leaders, media figures, and dissidents, as well as everyday people. Dividing his book into three sections, Osnos focuses on modern China's search for wealth, freedom, and meaning. The Wright Brothers (Simon & Schuster, May 2015) by David McCullough This Pulitzer Prize-winning author draws on an extensive collection of private diaries and letters to tell the human side of Wilbur and Orville Wright's story, beginning with their childhood in a Dayton, Ohio home with no plumbing or electricity. Rejecting recent historians' depictions of the brothers as fortunate tinkerers, McCullough argues that it was the Wrights' courage, dedication, and ingenuity that helped them succeed. McCullough also explores the contributions of their sister Katharine Wright, overlooked by earlier historians. The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age (Harvard Business Review Press, 2014) by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, and Chris Yeh The authors argue that in the networked age, managers and employees must see one another as neither family nor free agents but allies, with different but complementary goals. They offer recommendations for how both sides can get the most out of the relationship, including investing in one another's success and recognizing that talented employees may leave for other opportunities—and that this is no great insult. Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money (Harper, May 2015) by Nathaniel Popper Popper, a New York Times technology and business writer, tells the story of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency produced via mathematical formula with no central-bank oversight. Digital Gold describes how Bitcoin grew from a radical new idea on the outskirts of the web to a technology with a market capitalization of more than $3 billion. Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future (Ecco, May 2015) by Ashlee Vance The first journalist to obtain exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, Vance provides an inside view of Musk's journey. He argues that Musk's incredible work ethic and deep desire to see his ideas proven right, partially influenced by his challenging upbringing in South Africa, have driven him to relentlessly pursue game-changing ideas. Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End (Metropolitan Books, 2014) by Atul Gawande Gawande, a surgeon and best-selling author, argues that end-of-life goals for patients and families are dignity and quality of life—and that much of current care runs counter to these goals. He explores different models of hospice care, ones that are more likely to offer comfort and meaning. Humans Are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That Brilliant Machines Never Will (Portfolio, August 2015) by Geoff Colvin Colvin responds to growing concern about a “jobless future,” in which working people are replaced by machines, by arguing that technology is giving rise to a new economy where uniquely human skills—creativity, empathy, an ability to build relationships—are the most highly prized. Thirteen Days in September: the Dramatic Story of the Struggle for Peace (Vintage, April 2015) by Lawrence Wright Wright combines political analysis with research into the personal histories of Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin of Israel, and Anwar Sadat of Egypt to tell the story of the 1978 Camp David Accords, which laid the foundation for the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. Fiction The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Vintage, April 2015) by Richard Flanagan Centering his story around the building of the “Death Railway” from Thailand to Burma by captured Allied soldiers in World War II, Flanagan explores the depth of our capacity for both cruelty and compassion. Go Set a Watchman (Harper, July 2015) by Harper Lee Believed to have been lost, this book is Harper Lee's earliest known work, submitted to publishers before To Kill a Mockingbird . Rediscovered and published, it explores the events transforming 1950s America and their effects on life in Maycomb, Alabama. All the Light We Cannot See (Scribner, 2014) by Anthony Doerr A finalist for the National Book Award, this moving story depicts a German boy and a blind French girl whose lives become intertwined in World War II. McKinsey colleagues have published a number of excellent books and reports this year. Three I want to highlight in particular are: No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All the Trends (PublicAffairs, May 2015) by Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, and Jonathan Woetzel; Beyond Cybersecurity: Protecting Your Digital Business (Wiley, April 2015)  by James Kaplan, Tucker Bailey, Derek O'Halloran, Alan Marcus, and Chris Rezek; Brighter Africa: The growth potential of the sub-Saharan electricity sector by Antonio Castellano, Adam Kendall, Mikhail Nikomarov, and Tarryn Swemmer. Finally, I am modernising the summer reading list this year to include a podcast series: Invisibilia by Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller. In six one-hour-long podcasts, Invisibilia explores the invisible forces shaping our world, from the mechanical (e.g., digitisation, our ability to see) to the philosophical (e.g., where our thoughts come from.)

Announcing the Organizational Science Initiative,"Backed by McKinsey and Gallup, the initiative will create new approaches for using data to improve the performance of organizations.",2015-07-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Organization,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/announcing-the-organizational-science-initiative,"Announcing the Organizational Science Initiative July 15, 2015 The winds of change are blowing through organization, the branch of management concerned with the human side of the enterprise—topics such as employee engagement, change, culture, and leadership. While quantification and measurement have always been part of the toolkit, there is a growing imperative to collect and analyze hard data about what are sometimes seen as 'soft' management issues. Such is the context for our new collaboration with Gallup, the analytics and advice firm that has 80 years of experience measuring engagement, talent, and management. The Organizational Science Initiative, backed by McKinsey and Gallup, is a joint effort to develop next-generation org analytics. By pooling resources and working with leading thinkers in the field, the aim is to kindle new approaches and common data standards. The standards part is vital to enabling what data wonks call ""cross platform analysis"" across companies, industries, and regions. Organizational health is a key concept in all of this, says Chris Gagnon , leader of our organization analytics group at McKinsey. Says Chris: ""The problem is that no single firm has the ability to take all this data and translate it into a complete picture of organizational health. Combining the data and knowledge is going to mean we can look at org health in ways that haven't been possible before. (For more on the link between performance and health read The hidden value of organizational health—and how to capture it . ) Exactly how this will pan out is still being worked through. However, one of things that Gallup brings to the table is a trove of data from its Q12 employee engagement survey , which has been administered by hundreds of organizations since the late 1990s. From the McKinsey side comes data from the Organizational Health Index , a tool for measuring an organization's capacity to perform that's been used with about 900 clients globally. ""We think there's a lot to be gained by integrating our strength in organizational strategy and health with Gallup's deep insight into the attitudes and behaviors of individual employees,"" says Bill Schaninger, a McKinsey partner with a PhD in organizational psychology who leads advanced analytics for our global Organization Practice. In the meantime, the joint Gallup-McKinsey team is busy creating a global advisory board for the new initiative, comprised principally of chief human resource officers from large organizations. There are also plans for a series of regional summits to bring advisory board members together with other executives and experts. The goal is to keep the Organizational Science Initiative grounded in the business priorities of practicing managers while also shaping a long-term research agenda for the field.

"Made in Brazil: Smarter, leaner businesses","Our new model factory is a training ground for lean manufacturing, improving productivity in Latin America.",2015-07-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Capability Building,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/made-in-brazil-smarter-leaner-businesses,"Made in Brazil: Smarter, leaner businesses July 24, 2015 What can manufacturing steel cylinders teach you about making granola? Quite a bit, it turns out. Employees of a natural foods company in Salvador, Brazil recently completed a month-long transformation program at our newest model factory, Fabrica Modelo Brasil (FMB). This hands-on learning environment teaches the principles of lean manufacturing . Through a series of live scenarios and interactive exercises, the food company employees developed skills such as mapping a work stream, balancing a line, identifying waste, measuring cycle times, and creating relevant performance metrics. On returning to their own workplace—an industrial bakery—they began to apply these concepts, looking for ways to improve productivity. ""The process changes we made included prepping ingredients, such as grating the coconut the day before; reordering the steps in the recipe; standardizing measurements; and using lighter, less-expensive packaging,"" explains Bruna del Negro, the McKinsey consultant who worked on-site with the group. The employees doubled their production capacity without adding staff. ""Low productivity is the single biggest hindrance to growth in Latin America,"" says Björn Hagemann, the McKinsey partner who leads the program. This is especially true in the northeastern region of Brazil, which is underprivileged and developing very quickly. As companies come in to set up their first factory or facility in the region, they are often hiring people with limited or no experience. ""Field workers can become industrial employees overnight,"" according to Björn, ""and there is a tremendous need for skills."" To build FMB, our first model factory in Latin America, we partnered with SENAI, a major not-for-profit institution that provides formalized industrial training throughout the country. SENAI built the factory on the grounds of its Salvador campus and is focused on programs for micro, small, and medium-size businesses, the engine behind much of Brazil's potential growth. Our team supported the factory design, development of the lean curriculum, and staff training. The facility allows us to deliver customized training to clients—which are typically large organizations ranging from manufacturers to banks, retailers, government agencies, and more—embarking on major transformation programs. Objectives can range from improving the performance of supplier networks, streamlining core processes, or enhancing the skills of frontline employees. ""It makes a tremendous difference for our clients to be taught by our local experts who understand the idiosyncrasies of Latin American business—and they can do hands-on work in an actual model factory,"" says Björn. McKinsey then reinforces these newly learned skills with coaching, role modeling, and performance metrics to develop and ingrain new mind-sets and behaviors. A second pilot program included a professional uniform manufacturer. After spending time at the model factory, employees produced a 30 percent increase in output with no additional resources by realigning the sewing cells on the factory floor and redistributing the work flow per person. ""We want to offer our clients here in Salvador and the rest of northeast Brazil access to the same skills and ways of thinking that we provide to our clients in other parts of the world,"" says Vijay Gosula , the McKinsey director who founded the Salvador office three years ago. With a focus on hiring and growing local talent, the office is close-knit, young, and enthusiastic—some 15 business analysts are helping build our presence here, serving clients in the retail, consumer goods, infrastructure, and public sectors. ""I am from Salvador,"" says Victor Pinto, a local business analyst, ""and proud to be involved in some of the projects that are changing the city for the better.""

Food for thought,"The critical demand for food is creating opportunities for agricultural investment worldwide, and a keen appetite to improve productivity.",2015-08-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Agriculture,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/food-for-thought,"Food for thought Viroopa Volla, a business analyst based in our San Francisco office, stands in front of 30,000-pound silos used for blending fertilizer in Denver, Colorado. August 10, 2015 There are close to 100 McKinsey consultants who could be described as being obsessed with food. As members of our Agriculture Practice , they spend their time thinking about ways to make food taste better, cost less, last longer, and be healthier. They research and identify opportunities for investment, including the 20-plus global agriculture hot spots outlined in our latest report . They help feed the ever increasing global population by advising farmers, food processors, and others on how to make land more productive and food more available. Among their numbers are meteorologists, chemists, veterinarians, financial analysts, data geeks—and even foodies. Ludovic Meilhac Ludovic knows a lot about boysenberries. And cashews. And corn. But his real expertise is milk, knowledge developed during 13 years at Danone in France and North America—first on the manufacturing side, and then in sourcing. Today he works with our clients on sourcing ingredients and managing their food operations and supply chains. ""Milk looks simple. It's liquid. It's white. You can distill it into many products,"" he says. ""But you have no control over the cows—so you are managing an unpredictable supply with fluctuating demand for an ever increasing number of dairy products. This perpetual imbalance makes it always interesting."" Adding to the pressure is time: raw milk has a storage life of 24 to 48 hours, or it has to be thrown out. Processing milk used to be a straightforward choice—regular or skim? Today, there are some 100-plus variations, with different levels of fat, calcium, protein, preservatives, flavors, and more. Dairy producers need to make increasingly complex decisions in shorter and shorter time frames. ""We do not have a crystal ball, but what we can do is help our clients instill greater flexibility into their recipes, supply chains, and other systems,"" says Ludovic, ""so they can plan for and react faster to external forces such as fluctuating consumer preferences, weather changes, volatile commodity markets, and pricing pressures. They have more options."" Ludovic has also organized a network of resources that spans our Agriculture, Operations, Retail, and Consumer Practices. We can quickly mobilize, providing experts, knowledge, tools and resources to help clients improve their food operations. Lutz Goedde Born and raised in Germany, Lutz grew up working on dairy farms, milking cows, and riding horses—while playing professional volleyball on the side—and pursued advanced degrees in agricultural economics. Early internships in Africa and Central America laid the foundation for his later work in development. ""In 1990, I did field trials inspecting crops in South Africa. The country was on the cusp of democracy—apartheid had been abolished, everyone was consumed with politics,"" he remembers, ""and agriculture was critical to the future."" Several years later, he did a stint in Costa Rica managing commodity accounts in bananas, coffee, and sugar. He traveled through the subsistence farms where families were living in poverty. ""Both experiences made a profound impression on me."" With a new MBA in hand, Lutz worked with McKinsey's agribusiness clients for 4 years before taking a ""crazy offer"" to turn around a cattle-genetics company. When it returned to financial health several years later, he headed for the hills, climbing and skiing mountains in the Canadian Rockies. A call came out of the blue from Sunil Sanghvi , who leads McKinsey's Agriculture Practice, inviting him to a meeting with a leading foundation. That 3-hour brainstorming session led to a number of projects over the next 5 years, where Lutz initially led the team helping the organization formulate its agricultural-development program and later joined the foundation's leadership team in global development. Today, the foundation invests more than $1 billion annually in development initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Lutz serves a number of core clients in North America and Asia, including agricultural-input businesses such as seed, irrigation, and fertilizer companies. He helps investors identify opportunities for growth, as outlined in our newest report, pointing out that agriculture has outperformed most sectors since 2006. He sees the biggest global challenge of today as one of ensuring that the food supply keeps pace with demand. If current trends continue, by 2050, the demand for calories worldwide will rise by 70 percent. Demand for crops for human and livestock consumption will jump by 100 percent. How can we feed the nine billion people who will be living on our planet? Food security—ensuring that all people have access to nutritious, safe food—is an issue that all sectors of the food and agriculture industries are facing. Two possible solutions, says Lutz, are increasing output through technology and innovation and selectively bringing more land into production, for example, in Africa. David Fiocco One way to increase agricultural productivity is through data. Traditionally, much of the decision making in farming has been done by intuition and gut instinct. David wants to change that by applying data and analytics to agriculture, 25 kilometers of land at a time. David is an agricultural-development expert and a former Fulbright Scholar who studied postconflict agricultural networks in Sierra Leone. More recently, he leads the development of a new McKinsey software solution dubbed ACRE—or Agriculture Commodity Research Engine. It applies agronomic data to land maps anywhere in the world so that users can make smarter decisions about planting crops at a very local level. Government agencies can use ACRE to decide which crop initiatives to invest in. Food companies can use it to source raw ingredients more effectively. ""Mapping software revolutionized the way we travel and use location data,"" David said, ""and ACRE is changing the way we use data to improve agricultural output."" The bottom line is the urgent need to improve agricultural productivity. ""If we can apply the full potential of our resources to agriculture, we can more effectively feed millions of hungry kids and adults,"" says Lutz. ""It doesn't get any more basic than that.""

Generation update: Connecting graduates with jobs on three continents,"As McKinsey Social Initiative’s youth employment program expands, we catch up with two graduates from its first cohorts.",2015-08-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Generation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/generation-update-connecting-graduates-with-jobs-on-three-continents,"Generation update: Connecting graduates with jobs on three continents Graduates of McKinsey Social Initiative’s Generation program in Pittsburgh celebrate on their way to becoming certified nursing assistants. August 18, 2015 When more than 75 million young adults are out of work globally and three times as many are underemployed, it can feel like a triumph every time a young person is hired into a skilled job. Generation , a program spearheaded by the McKinsey Social Initiative , is addressing youth employment one small triumph at a time by helping young people build the skills they need to land good jobs in their local economies. Generation began with pilots in Spain and the United States and now has additional programs up and running in India, Kenya, and Mexico. The focus of each program depends on the local job market—the skills that employers need— but the learning is always intense. Generation courses are short, focused, and practical and free for participants. So far, Generation graduates are achieving encouraging results. In Spain, where the focus is on digital skills, 90 percent of the first cohort continues to be employed 6 months (and counting) after graduation. In the United States, where the focus is on healthcare, 93 percent of all graduates from the Generation program went on to pass the exam to become certified nursing assistants (CNAs), far surpassing the 50 percent national average pass rate. Within a month of passing the exam, 85 percent were placed into quality healthcare jobs. We checked in with two graduates of Generation, in the United States and Spain. Carly studied to become a CNA at Generation Pittsburgh and graduated this spring. In Madrid, Enrique studied digital marketing. Carly Carly, 20, grew up in Pittsburgh, a once-booming industrial city in America's rust belt. Still transitioning away from a manufacturing economy to other sectors, Pittsburgh is a challenging place for a young person to find a job, let alone start a career. Add to this the personal challenges that Carly had to face as a young mother at 19, armed with a high school degree, and little professional experience. Carly and Tamika met during their program at Generation #Pittsburgh, where they trained to become certified #nurse assistants. More @youemployed A post shared by McKinsey & Company (@mckinseyco) on Aug 11, 2015 at 11:22am PDT After 2 years of working in the laundry of a nursing home, Carly heard about Generation's training program to become a CNA. An emerging interest in working with the elderly and a growing daughter at home motivated her to action. ""I'll tell Delilah it's where we started. It's where Mommy started getting everything together for us,"" Carly says. During the program, Carly developed a close-knit group of friends who carried each other through to graduation and beyond. ""Generation played a big role in my evolution as an adult. They taught us how to be an adult in the real world, and that it's not always easy, but there are ways to do it."" Now employed as a CNA in the same nursing home where she worked in the laundry, Carly plans to continue studying to become a registered nurse. Her parents, she thinks, ""are really shocked and proud that I made it this far. But they need to know that I'm not just stopping here. I am just excited to see what the world is going to give me. Bring it on, world."" Enrique Enrique, 25, studied business administration and management at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. But, like nearly 50 percent of young people his age in Spain, he struggled to find a job. Any job. ""I felt powerless. I was even looking for work abroad, but I have lots of bonds here,"" he said. Enrique, like many young people in #Spain, struggled to find a good #job. Then, he signed up for Generation Spain's intensive #digital #marketing course. Learn more by following @youemployed A post shared by McKinsey & Company (@mckinseyco) on Aug 19, 2015 at 11:21am PDT He learned about Generation Spain while surfing the Internet. ""I applied after feeling frustrated, after thinking that I wasn't good, or that nobody cared about me."" After the Generation course in digital marketing, Enrique felt like he could finally fill the gaps between what he learned at university and the demands of the workplace. ""When I was in university, they told us to work in teams, but nobody taught me how to do it. At Generation, we learn to work in teams. We've also gotten better at dealing with people, at speaking, at giving feedback. It's the first training I've ever received on how to do that."" After graduating, Enrique found a job at iDoctus, a start-up that digitizes medical files. With only twelve employees in the company, he reports directly to the CEO. Thanks to his newly acquired skills, he monitors the analytics for marketing and use of the company's app. ""For me, and I don't mean to exaggerate, but it's like I discovered a new planet. I now have a new world to explore. If not for Generation, it would have been much harder to find this kind of job."" Next up for Generation More Generation graduates will be joining Carly and Enrique in the working world. A new class just graduated from a pilot to train CNAs in Wilmington, Delaware, and San Jose has a pilot in place as well. San Jose is slated to have its own CNA training pilot this year. Generation Kenya began in May and has already achieved inspiring results: a 98 percent job-placement rate for its first cohort, in financial services sales jobs that typically only go to university graduates. Generation India, where young people train for entry-level jobs in healthcare, also opened its doors this summer. Generation Mexico will place graduates in jobs in the retail sector and is accepting applications for its first cohort. Generation will continue scaling to new sites and professions. Moreover, it's committed to measuring its return on investment both for its graduates and the employers who hire them. They've planned a 15-year longitudinal study to understand just how lives and businesses have changed as a result of participating in Generation. Never miss a story"

The book, whose sixth edition came out in August, not only explains in simple language how companies create value for shareholders but also links those principles to strategy creation, portfolio management, and capital structure. Less a textbook than a handbook, it uses real-world examples to show how growth and return on capital drive cash flows, which in turn drive value creation. This practical approach reflects the origins of Valuation as a handbook for McKinsey consultants. When Tim joined the firm in 1987, McKinsey was deepening its corporate finance capabilities to help clients navigate an era of swashbuckling corporate raiders and hostile takeovers. Tim and colleagues produced a guide to advanced valuation techniques contained in a three-ring binder. This became the foundation for the first edition of the book. Of the three McKinsey authors on the cover of the first edition, only Tim (now a leader in our Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice ) remains for the sixth. His coauthors this time around are Marc Goedhardt , a senior expert based in our Amsterdam office; and David Wessels , a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Over the years, Tim has seen a number of shifts in the way managers think about value. Historically, managers tended to focus on earnings growth, but return on capital has gradually become just as important for many companies. ""That's important because value creation is really about getting the balance right between growth and return on capital,"" Tim says. ""Earnings growth without return on capital does not create value."" The sixth edition arrives at a time of growing concern about corporate short-termism: the all-too-prevalent focus on chasing quarterly earnings growth, even if that puts long-term value at risk. ""When I talk to investors, it's clear short-term profits are not what they care about,"" says Tim. ""But while companies will say, 'We are long-term focused,' when you look at their decisions, that doesn't always seem the case."" The new edition of Valuation makes a strong case that companies with long-term horizons create more value and outperform competitors. During client meetings and presentations, Tim often encounters CEOs and CFOs who tell him they read Valuation early in their careers and it changed the way they think about business. He knows that, amidst intense performance pressures and high executive turnover, it takes a lot of courage to do what's needed to build lasting value for the company. His advice: ""When executives think about shareholder value creation, nothing says it has to be about today's shareholders. If they think about the collective benefit for today's and future shareholders, they might make different decisions."" Never miss a story"
Our newest location: Vancouver,"Vancouver marks our 107th office worldwide. Other recent office openings include Almaty and Denver. Vancouver is the fourth office of ours to open in Canada and will serve British Columbia where a variety of industries are poised to grow.
",2015-09-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Offices,North America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-newest-location-vancouver,"Our newest location: Vancouver September 14, 2015 This week, we're celebrating the opening of a new McKinsey office, in Vancouver. Vancouver marks our 107th office worldwide. Other recent office openings include Almaty and Denver. Vancouver is the fourth office of ours to open in Canada and will serve British Columbia where a variety of industries are poised to grow. The expansion is partly the result of double-digit growth in Canadian operations, and the potential to increase it further in western Canada. ""The opportunities for our clients out west have been substantial, because that's where Canada's economic and population growth has been,"" says Eric Lamarre, managing partner for Canada. Vancouver itself has a diverse business community that's particularly strong in the natural resource sector. But Eric admits that the main rationale for the new office is the chance to create a new talent hub. ""Vancouver is the city where a great many Canadians and non-Canadians want to live,"" he says. For our global managing director, Dominic Barton, Vancouver's opening holds a special meaning. ""I grew up in BC and spent the first decade of my McKinsey career in our Canadian offices—and I am proud to see our firm have a presence in this important and dynamic region,"" he says. Dom spoke at the official office opening event at the Vancouver Board of Trade on September 9, which was attended by more than 250 local business leaders. Many on the new Vancouver team will come from our other locations. Miklos Dietz, Vancouver's new managing partner, moved with his family from Budapest after managing our office there. ""Canada is one of the most inspiring countries in the world,"" he says. ""To me, it's a great mix of what is good about North America—freedom, innovation, willingness to dream and challenge common wisdom—and a caring society like those found in Northern Europe. If you're a European and think about moving, it's likely that you want to come to Canada,"" and Vancouver specifically. ""Vancouver stands out even in Canada with its diversity, cosmopolitan culture and breathtaking beauty,"" he says. Likewise, principal Matías Marcote and his young family moved from Mexico City. ""It's actually my daughter's first birthday on the day we officially open the office—it could be a lucky sign,"" he says. Luckily for Miklos and his family, Vancouver is also the most livable city in North America (and third in the word), with the top-ranked education system in the western hemisphere . It's also one of the most diverse, with half of the city's residents speaking English as their second language. And it's green, with vast natural beauty and strong environmental leadership. Associate principal Benjamin Goodier knew all about Vancouver's accolades first hand—he grew up there, and worked remotely from the Calgary office. When he learned the firm would open an office in his hometown, he jumped at the opportunity to contribute. ""As someone from Vancouver, and for all the Vancouver folks in the firm, it's incredibly exciting to see McKinsey making this commitment to our community, because in the end, we believe it will benefit because of it."" Benjamin and Matías, worked throughout the year on the logistics, including finding the right office. The one they selected has a bonus: ""On clear days, it's got a phenomenal view over English Bay,"" Benjamin says. ""What's more,"" Matías notes, ""is that this office can really build a community, both with local Vancouver businesses, and amongst the consultants who will join the office."" One way he's fostering the latter is by donating a soft-serve ice cream machine to the office. He also stresses that the office, which will have 20 members by December, is the perfect size to build close mentoring relationships between colleagues. McKinsey first opened an office in Canada 47 years ago and soon after began serving clients from the southern border to the Canadian Arctic. Other Canadian offices include Calgary, Montreal, and Toronto. To date, we've served two-thirds of Canada's top companies, as well as many of its leading public-sector organizations.

September 22, 2015 Today we received recognition for our efforts to achieve gender equality here at McKinsey: a top ten position in Working Mother 's ranking of the 100 best employers in the United States . The ranking reflects the strength of the programs we've put in place to support working mothers and the excellent qualities that strong women bring to McKinsey. Recognition of this kind is humbling. While the Working Mother ranking is a significant accolade, we understand we aren't where we want to be in terms of gender diversity. Neither is the broader business world. That's why we're redoubling our efforts—including making specific commitments as part of the UN Women HeForShe campaign—and continuing to invest in research that analyzes the business case for gender diversity and contributes to greater understanding of the multiple factors that are barriers for women in the workplace . Keep an eye out later this week for the publication of a major research report by the McKinsey Global Institute exploring the contribution gender equality could make to global economic growth. On the ground, we've strengthened support for women at McKinsey with three new initiatives: All In All In is a McKinsey-wide effort, led by McKinsey partners reporting to our global managing director, to strengthen, attract, and develop colleagues with diverse backgrounds, leadership styles, and ways of thinking. The initial focus is on recruiting, retaining, and developing women. During its first year, All In helped expand existing programs (for example, our Next Generation Women Leaders Award and recruiting program) while also introducing brand-new elements, including training for both men and women on how unconscious biases affect business and decision making. Pace Pace adds a new dimension to our suite of flexibility programs by providing an option for consultants to stay in their current role without harming their prospects for advancement. While professional-services firms traditionally have used an ""up or out"" model, in which people advance at a standard rate, Pace gives participants greater control over their career progression. The program is open to all consultants and can be particularly helpful for women, who may feel intense pressure to catch up after maternity leave. Ramp Off, Ramp On Ramp Off, Ramp On started in North America and has now been rolled out globally. It provides expectant mothers with more advice, support, and information so they can prepare for an extended leave and stay connected during that leave—as much or as little as they wish. The program includes an assigned counselor who facilitates transitions and makes going on and returning from leave as seamless as possible. In addition, the counselor pays special attention to tailor the returning consultant's review process to account for her time away. We also want to acknowledge one of our colleagues who was instrumental in highlighting our efforts as part of the Working Mother evaluation process: director Celia Huber . Additionally, our honoree for Working Mother of the Year Nora Gardner , a principal in our Washington, DC, office, embodies our core value of ""make your own McKinsey."" She has created true work-life balance, leading collaborative efforts within our Organization and Public Sector Practices and spearheading many of our initiatives within McKinsey, all while raising her two young children. It's inspiring to have mentors like Celia and Nora at McKinsey. You can read about other programs on our Careers website. Never miss a story"

October 8, 2015 Our acquisition of product and industrial-design firm LUNAR captured attention . What's less well known is that we have been quietly assembling an impressive corps of design talent. LUNAR aside, more than 50 McKinsey experience and digital designers are now working with clients in multidisciplinary consulting teams. Design studios are up and running in Berlin, London, New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. Why introduce experience design to the consulting mix? ""The rise of digital and mobile is a big part of the answer,"" says Hugo Sarrazin, a Silicon Valley–based director and leader of Digital Labs . ""Every company has opportunities to reimagine how it interacts with customers, suppliers, and employees. It is now often the source of new competitive differentiation or the trigger to build a new disruptive business model. Design thinking and rapid prototyping can be paired with our industry and functional expertise to form a pretty potent combination."" As Hugo concedes, however, getting designers and consultants to work together effectively isn't always easy at first. Design thinking is very different from the analytic style in which most consultants are trained. The trick is to focus not on what separates them but on what they share. Both use iterative problem solving approaches. Both are focused on client impact. ""Designers aren't people who simply create wire frames or apply colors; they are problem solvers and strategic thinkers who lead with people,"" says Jennifer Kilian , a digital VP based in New York who honed her skills at companies including Apple, Facebook, Frog Design, IBM, and Intuit. Not unlike our typical engagement, the archetypal design process starts with immersion, using a variety of research techniques—such as interviews, field research, and ethnography—to develop a deep understanding of customers. However, it is done to build true empathy for customer needs, pain points, and aspirations. Jared Braiterman , a Tokyo-based design VP and Stanford PhD anthropologist, puts it this way: ""Design is essentially about people, no matter the product, service, or business."" Next in the design process comes ideation: looking at adjacent situations, combining ideas, and using lateral thinking to address the pain points and identify possible solutions. The ideas that emerge are often diverse, so they need to be grouped and presented in some kind of framework, without which structured discussion is difficult. The last step is iteration, the process of testing and learning that refines prototypes into products and services that are ingenious and beautiful—while also being delightful (in the sense of fulfilling an unmet need) and incorporating signature moments (recognizable elements of the experience that a company can own). This last step is critical, rather than to seek a singular answer we create a process that maximizes learning with our clients. Empathy? Beauty? Signature moments? These elements may seem foreign to anyone with a strong left-brained orientation. Then again, the emphasis on customer insight, problem solving, logical framing, and above all getting to an answer that works is something every McKinsey consultant can embrace. ""We're not trying to turn McKinsey into a design-centered institution,"" says Hyo Yeon , a digital partner with Digital Labs whose pre-McKinsey career included senior roles at design agencies including Fjord and Razorfish. ""But we've found that by incorporating design thinking into how we serve clients we can significantly increase our collective impact as a team."" Never miss a story"
McKinsey leans in on gender equality,"Recently we&rsquo;ve redoubled our efforts on gender equality, committing to initiatives such as UN Women&rsquo;s HeForShe and Australia&rsquo;s Male Champions of Change, as well as publishing major research reports including The power of parity&nbsp;(from the McKinsey Global Institute) and Women in the workplace (in partnership with Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s LeanIn.Org.)",2015-10-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Diversity",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-leans-in-on-gender-equality,"McKinsey leans in on gender equality October 23, 2015 Recently we’ve redoubled our efforts on gender equality, committing to initiatives such as UN Women’s HeForShe and Australia’s Male Champions of Change , as well as publishing major research reports including The power of parity (from the McKinsey Global Institute) and Women in the workplace (in partnership with Sheryl Sandberg’s LeanIn.Org.) Among the sobering takeaways from the research: at a macro level, global GDP realistically could increase by $12 trillion if women participated in the workforce on more equal terms with men. Yet, at a micro level, at the current rate of progress, US companies are still decades—or perhaps even a century—away from achieving gender parity at every level of the organization. Our goal is to galvanize and inform action on this critical economic and social issue. To get behind the numbers, we asked three senior McKinsey women to reflect on the research from the perspective of accomplished professionals. What resonates with them, and why? The Women in the workplace research revealed that women remain underrepresented at every stage of the talent pipeline. Among the companies surveyed, women account for 45 percent of employees at the entry level, but the number drops dramatically to 32 percent by midcareer and 17 percent at the top level of the organization. It's important that companies look at multiple ways to address this issue. Says Celia Huber , a McKinsey director: “Sponsorship is everything. A sponsor can create opportunities, instill confidence to make the most of those opportunities, and provide inspiration when times are tough.” McKinsey principal Kara Carter agrees: “The sponsorship point really hit home for me. I’ve had the tremendous benefit of wonderful sponsors—women and men—without whom I would not be where I am today. The research encouraged me to focus on making sure women I care about are connecting not just with women sponsors but also with senior men who can create meaningful opportunities for them.” Another key finding is that less than half of employees believe that gender diversity is a top priority for their CEO, even though 74 percent of companies report that their CEO is highly committed to diversity. For a variety of reasons, top management commitments often do not seem to be translating into changes in women's day-to-day reality in the workplace. The research showed, for example, that although many programs facilitate flexible working, employees often don’t participate for fear of damaging their career prospects. Tackling these issues requires acknowledging and changing the unconscious biases held by both men and women at senior levels. “The idea that you can have real meritocracy when decision makers are all one type is on its face not valid,” McKinsey principal Susan Colby says. “It speaks to an ongoing challenge: unconscious bias in the workplace.” One common theme arising from The power of parity and Women in the workplace is the disproportionate share of unpaid care work—everything from child care and elder care to cooking and domestic chores—carried out by women around the world. Even in supposedly developed economies, this imbalance leaves many women feeling boxed in and unable or unwilling to take career risks. Says Susan: “I think many women make decisions that are someone else’s: a society or a culture or a husband that doesn’t want them to work. If you don’t understand yourself and your choices, you live someone else’s life and never discover your own equilibrium. My biggest wish for women in the thick of it is that they empower themselves to make their own decisions.” Never miss a story"
TechPrep: Finding and inspiring the technologists of the future with Facebook,It’s no secret that the technology sector struggles with diversity. Engineers at tech’s biggest and brightest companies are predominantly white and male. This is not only an ethical issue but also a looming economic problem.,2015-10-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Digital,Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/techprep,"TechPrep: Finding and inspiring the technologists of the future with Facebook October 30, 2015 It’s no secret that the technology sector struggles with diversity. Engineers at tech’s biggest and brightest companies are predominantly white and male. This is not only an ethical issue but also a looming economic problem. By 2020, there could be one million programming jobs unfilled in the United States; encouraging a wider swath of the population to pursue technology careers is part of the solution. Such is the background to our support for Facebook’s TechPrep initiative, which launched last week. A California-based McKinsey team led by Susan Colby , James Manyika , Helen Ma, Kelsey Robinson, and Lareina Yee worked with Facebook for several months to research and understand ways to boost the talent pipeline of young people of color and women in tech. The team researched the attitudes of parents and children to careers in programming and then curated an online platform to provide the information and resources they need. The TechPrep website features resources, profiles, and videos in English and in Spanish to spark interest, inform, and inspire. “The lack of diversity in most tech organizations—and many organizations in general—means that we’re not getting the benefit of the full talent pool. And for these young people, the opportunities that careers in tech bring are tremendous,” says Susan. The team brought together members with expertise in social-science research, consumer marketing, user experience, technology, and education. The nature of the project quickly became personal. “I never even considered computer science as a career, so it’s been really interesting to think about why I didn’t pursue it. Others on the team with technical backgrounds felt a personal commitment to this cause. I think this is one of the most meaningful projects that the team has done,"" says Kelsey. Kevin Caldwell, an associate based in San Francisco, agrees. “I grew up in a community where economics had limited many people’s educational opportunities.  But at an early age, I discovered that I could speak the language of math and science.  It just clicked,"" says Kevin.  “I want to see that happen for more kids today.” “Many of us are parents who are trying to encourage our kids too. Even though I’m in this field, I learned a ton,” explains Lareina. She was happy to learn from the team’s research that Minecraft, beloved by her two young sons, is also a helpful introduction to programming concepts. The path to achieving parity in tech holds different obstacles for girls, Latinos, and African-Americans. “The barriers are not one-size-fits-all,” says Lareina. For African-Americans and Latinos, less awareness of computer science is due to less access to both people and programs in computer science. This significantly contributes to decisions about dropping out of the field when the same groups decide to pursue it. Meanwhile, women and girls use the computer science resources available to them at a lower rate than men and boys. Only 24 percent of females take computer classes in school, compared to 35 percent of males. And only 33 percent of women and girls say they would be good at working with computers, compared with half of men and boys. What’s more, parents are largely unaware of how to encourage their children to pursue computer science: 77 percent say they don’t know how to help their children in this regard at all. That figure increases to 83 percent for parents without college degrees or with lower incomes. When women, African-Americans, and Latinos report that being encouraged to pursue computer science by a parent or guardian was a primary motivator, there’s reason to believe an increase in parental awareness and involvement could yield dividends in the future for a diverse body of technologists. What does the future hold? For the initiative, McKinsey will continue as a research partner to Facebook and share some of the key findings garnered from the project. “The research is not exclusive to Facebook. In fact from day one the goal has been to create an open platform and pipeline (hence the age range) that benefits the sector as a whole and society at large. So colleagues are encouraged to draw on this research and leverage it with their own clients and others in the tech community,” James explains. For computer science and technical professions, “We have an enormous way to go for girls and underserved populations, but I think the awareness has improved. It’s starting to become more transparent that we don’t have a true representation of the population in these professions,” Lareina says. Learn more about our Education Practice . Never miss a story"

November 5, 2015 The executives and policy makers who descend each October on Deauville don't come to paddle in la Manche , any more than delegates go to Davos in January for the skiing. The seaside town in northern France is home to the annual meeting of the Women's Forum for the Economy and Society , which has grown in 10 years to become an important date on the European business calendar. We've been pleased to partner with the Women's Forum since 2006, each year sharing the latest findings from our Women Matter research program. This year more than 1,300 men and women came to Deauville for 3 days of debating, learning, and problem solving. Sandrine Devillard , a director based in Paris, and Anu Madgavkar , a McKinsey Global Institute senior fellow based in Mumbai, presented highlights from our recent report, The power of parity , which looks at the potential for increased gender equality to boost economic growth. As with our partnerships with Facebook , the UN's HeForShe initiative, and LeanIn.Org , Deauville is part of a bigger commitment to create a fact-based dialogue that leads to concrete action. This year, the McKinsey team also helped to convene and facilitate a private workshop for 45 senior leaders from private- and public-sector institutions, plus 15 diversity experts, as part of the forum's CEO Champions initiative. As befits a workshop, participants were made to work—split into groups and pushed to explore big ideas that could challenge the organizational status quo. How about appointing male and female co-CEOs? Or creating a gender-parity index to assess organizations on critical indicators? Look for a forthcoming white paper capturing the group's ideas and reactions. Just as the World Economic Forum has expanded beyond its annual shindig in Davos, the Women's Forum is planning 2016 events in Dubai (in March ) and Mexico City (in April). Another outgrowth: the Cartier Women's Initiative Award —founded by Cartier, INSEAD, McKinsey, and the Women's Forum—to support female entrepreneurs. Sandrine has been involved since the early days and seen the Women's Forum in Deauville grow from small beginnings. ""It remains a special place with a special spirit,"" she says. ""With the CEO Champions meeting, we've now got a fantastic opportunity to gather the best ideas from the private and public sectors and make change happen."" Never miss a story"

The deal is our fourth acquisition of 2015, in areas ranging from product design to pricing optimization . We’ve also entered into a number of strategic partnerships, some involving equity investments. Behind these deals is a deliberate strategy to bring new tools, technologies, and capabilities to McKinsey clients, says Daniel Pacthod leader of our New Ventures unit: “Clients are asking us for more than just advice. We’re building some terrific new capabilities organically and we’re actively looking for partnerships or acquisitions where it makes sense.” QuantumBlack’s roughly 45 employees will continue to operate from their existing premises in London’s Tech City under the company’s distinctive name. However, the acquisition opens the door to work jointly with McKinsey teams on client projects across a wide range of industries. “Differences between teams [in Formula 1] are measured in milliseconds so they look for every available opportunity to make improvements,” says QuantumBlack co-founder Simon Williams. “Analyzing data at scale is a way to optimize the performance not only of cars but also of engineering teams and whole organizations.” Nicolaus Henke, head of McKinsey Analytics , said “Data analytics is one of the most disruptive and potentially transformative developments in management. QuantumBlack, through its Nerve platform, combines data from disparate sources to produce meaningful data around human endeavor—something that previously has not been reliably measured.  This is why we’re so excited about the combination of our organizations—together we can provide our clients with a completely new means of making decisions and converting knowledge into action.” “We’ve always been strong when it comes to working at the leadership level, and we bring fantastic analytical skill,” says Jeremy Palmer, QuantumBlack’s Chief Executive. “But what we haven’t yet had is the kind of broad domain expertise and implementation capabilities that McKinsey brings.” Bill Wiseman , head of McKinsey Analytics in Asia, said “McKinsey and QuantumBlack worked together for more than a year in a number of industries. This approach to organizational performance requires not only a flair for statistics but also industry expertise, experience implementing change programs, and earned credibility with senior executives—all of which are McKinsey strengths.” In a typical project, once objectives are agreed upon with the client, the first step is to bring together large amounts data from disparate sources—everything from engineering systems to performance-management systems to email servers. The consulting team then applies sophisticated analytical techniques (usually including machine learning) to find out what drives performance and uses data visualization to render the findings in a way that brings them alive for client executives. At this point, the rubber really meets the road: working with the client to decide on a course of action, align employees and other stakeholders, and make change happen over weeks and months. Sven Smit , head of McKinsey Western Europe, notes that the McKinsey and QuantumBlack teams worked together successfully on a number of client projects before an acquisition was mooted. Even so, he concedes that making acquisitions work is never easy. The keys to success? “We’re doing what we advise clients to do in these circumstances: get to know each other really well and develop a winning shared forward plan and put real resources into post-deal support. The deal doesn’t end when the ink is dry.” Never miss a story"
Digging deep on the Transbay Tunnel,The proposed Transbay Tunnel would be one of California’s largest infrastructure projects and could help maintain the growth trajectory of the $700bn regional economy.,2015-12-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Capital Projects and Infrastructure,North America,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/digging-deep-on-the-transbay-tunnel,"Digging deep on the Transbay Tunnel McKinsey director Rob Palter discusses the Transbay Tunnel project with Libby Schaaf, Mayor of Oakland, Ed Reiskin of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and Claus Baunkjær, Managing Director of Femern A/S December 22, 2015 If you’re going to assemble the world’s leading infrastructure experts, you may as well put them to work. This was the thinking behind a series of workshops at our recent Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII) conference, outside of San Francisco. Participants were asked to provide ideas and advice on how to plan, finance, build, and operate a new multibillion-dollar rail tunnel under San Francisco Bay. The proposed Transbay Tunnel would be one of California’s largest infrastructure projects and could help maintain the growth trajectory of the $700 billion regional economy. If the San Francisco Bay Area were a country, it would slot between Saudi Arabia and Sweden in the global pecking order. Moreover, the region is expected to add 1.5 million new residents over the next 25 years. Making it easier for people to move quickly and easily across the eponymous bay is an economic necessity. To be sure, there are things that the region could do now that don’t involve digging tunnels, such as improving the efficiency of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (which already runs via a single tunnel under the bay) and adding more ferries. Yet these patches, while useful, would not be enough to cope with the future demand. “We’re not going to be able to sustain growth if we can’t unlock the potential of mobility that the Transbay Tunnel would bring,” says Ed Reiskin, director of transportation of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. As currently envisioned, the new four-mile tunnel between the cities of San Francisco and Oakland would carry two commuter-train lines and two high-speed tracks. Once built, it would reduce commuting times and bolster the whole transit system’s capacity and resilience. The GII workshops revealed little concern about the engineering side of the project: big infrastructure companies know how to build tunnels. Consensus among the assembled brain trust was that the bigger challenges relate to planning, politics, and finance. A taste of the discussions: The GII team is now expanding upon these and other recommendations and synthesizing them into a white paper for the consideration of Bay Area political leaders and planners. The result may not be as visually stunning as the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, but it could be every bit as important to the economic future of the region. Never miss a story"

But not all knees are created equal. A 35-year-old athlete may need a simpler, less costly surgery than an 82-year-old with severe arthritis. The hospitals that treat both patients often are paid by the number of services they deliver—not necessarily the outcome and quality. The first step to improving patient care, the critical challenge in healthcare analytics , is to make it more measurable and factual across a single “episode of care,” such as a knee replacement or pregnancy or heart attack. Explains Alex Beauvais , vice president and general manager of our healthcare analytics group: “We can map diverse patient journeys across thousands of cases to make measurable, apple-to-apple comparisons that are clinically and technically reliable. For each episode of care, we have physicians and medical coders who can design these patient journeys and identify the sources of value within them—for example, using an outpatient setting rather than a hospital. Then our advanced-analytics and technology staff guide the data inputs and modeling from start to finish. We take into account the many variations, including outlier cases within a single episode of care.” A key focus area for Alex’s team is eventually using these episodes of care and tangible facts to develop payment models that incent providers to shift from delivering “more individual services” to focusing on “overall better patient outcomes.” With an MBA and extensive technology experience, Alex joined McKinsey seven years ago to help build our big data capabilities and eventually focused exclusively on healthcare. Today, our North America–based team counts some 100 physicians, medical coders, data scientists, statisticians, and software developers among their ranks—working alongside strategists, consultants, and project managers. They design and develop algorithms and run analytics on a big data platform that integrates 100 terabytes of proprietary and third-party claim, encounter, and clinical data. McKinsey also has a healthcare-analytics team in Europe. “We can help a client define a strategy and also design a comprehensive model loaded with production-grade algorithms to forecast the impact of that strategy,” Alex says. The team is also developing models related to primary care, provider performance and growth, payment integrity, and special-needs populations. Modeling data is an art as well as a science. Gerold Scheunemann, a senior data scientist based in Dusseldorf, has over 15 years of experience in analytics. He explains: “Success isn’t about just having the most powerful or complicated model; it’s about having a powerful model and getting the right information into that model. After all, data are always neutral. They tell you the truth only when they include all the relevant information. A highly sophisticated model with insufficient data is much less useful than a good model with a comprehensive database.” One other area where analytics can play a significant role is improving the quality of care for the long-term population suffering from mental illness or behavioral-health conditions. “This is a very nebulous area in healthcare, and often a patient will have several interrelated conditions,” says Alex. With analytics, we can help payors and providers better understand such a population, with answers to questions like these: How many patients have multiple conditions? What is the optimum care-delivery mechanism for each condition? What factors explain why some people stick to their meds and others do not? “With analytics, for the first time we can put facts on the table,” notes Alex, “and that completely changes the conversation.” Never miss a story"
Decoding Davos,Why go to Davos? Because the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the mountains of Switzerland remains a unique opportunity to connect efficiently and effectively with an extraordinary number of clients and key decision-makers.,2016-01-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Davos,Europe,Global Managing Partner",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/decoding-davos,"Decoding Davos From left: Dominic Barton, McKinsey’s global managing director, Dennis Nally, chairman, PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd., Jean-Pascal Tricoire, CEO Schneider Electric, and Emma Watson during a panel discussion promoting gender parity. January 29, 2016 by Dominic Barton —Why go to Davos? Because the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the mountains of Switzerland remains a unique opportunity to connect efficiently and effectively with an extraordinary number of clients and key decision-makers. After four intense days of formal sessions, one-on-one meetings, and snatched conversations I always come away with a sharper sense of the issues to which we—and our clients—should be paying attention. This year was no exception. As a firm we send five official delegates—this year myself plus Cornelius Baur, Gary Pinkus , Vivian Riefberg, and Kevin Sneader. What do we actually do? Well, among other things: We hosted four dinners with a broad range of CEOs to explore the topics of  digitization and analytics; we held a breakfast discussion on the topic of “ Organizing for the Future ,” featuring Carlos Ghosn of the Nissan Alliance and Randall Stephenson of ATT; Kevin spoke alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron and Queen Rania of Jordan on the challenge of finding sustainable jobs for refugees; Vivian spoke at both The Girls’ Lounge (the first female-focused, male-inclusive destination for women at Davos), and a Seneca Women event; along with Larry Fink of BlackRock, Mark Wiseman of CPPIB, Andrew Liveris of Dow and Cyrus Mistry of Tata Group, I co-hosted a two hour working session with CEOs and institutional investors who are members of our Focusing Capital on the Long Term initiative. On Friday, I also took part in an event hosted by UN Women as part of their HeForShe initiative , promoting gender parity. We are one of the ten ‘corporate impact champions.’ Actress Emma Watson chaired an interesting discussion involving other impact champions including the CEOs of Twitter, Unilever, and Schneider. As part of HeForShe, we have made public for the first time data about our own progress towards gender parity within McKinsey. The figures are a reminder of the challenge we, along with other organizations, face—particularly in retaining women as they progress towards senior leadership positions. We have put in place a number of measures to address this but have a long way to go. We also found time for meetings with close to 300 clients and contacts. Yes, good calendar management remains a core competence. As for the ‘big themes’ that dominated discussion, here are six that struck me as particularly interesting: The technology revolution rolls on. Discussion centered on the speed, scale and force at which technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, nanotechnology, and biotech are transforming industries and markets. Without doubt, this is changing our lives and the lives of future generations. We heard genuine excitement about the opportunities created by these technologies—along with concern about the societal challenges, especially with respect to job creation. Global growth isn’t over. Financial and commodity markets convulsed during the week, with oil plunging and share prices sinking. But the overall picture on growth was more positive than this suggests. Our own sense, echoed by a number of others, is that while the macro-economic outlook remains tough in the first half—and we may not yet be done on the downside—things will probably pick up in the second half. China isn’t over. Is a hard landing ahead? Or is China’s economic deceleration just part of an essential transition? We tend to share the mindset of those who would prefer to see a sustainable 5-6% growth this year led by services than an unsustainable 9-10% growth led by investment. India too continues to generate optimism and a sense that real change may be underway. Geopolitical worries. Regional conflicts, terrorism and the threat of ISIS loomed large in political discussions, as did the ongoing humanitarian tragedy of the refugee crisis in Europe—which many now see as a “make or break” challenge for the EU. Nationalism is clearly rising, and we still lack a clear framework for how the international order should evolve. Organizational change. Business leaders feel under intense pressure to keep evolving business models and operating models, both to fend off new competitors and to take advantage of emerging technologies such as automation and machine learning. This requires a willingness to retool processes, retrain people, and invest capital at scale, all amid deep uncertainty. Many CEOs see this as being the defining issue of their tenure. Focusing executives on the long-term. It is no secret that this is one of my personal passions. The corollary to being able to adapt to rapid change is the imperative to resist short term pressures and manage companies for the long term. Based on conversations at Davos, we aim to deepen conversations with boards and executives and also explore regulatory changes and new metrics that can help move the needle in the right direction. Every country and company faces unique challenges. But as this WEF reminded us, our common task is to adapt successfully to some of the deepest long-term technological changes we have faced in our careers—all while coping with a geopolitical and macro-economic context that grows more volatile. We returned from Davos determined to keep innovating to help our clients do just that. Never miss a story"
A new deal in risk&mdash;our latest acquisition,It’s a time of great change in the sometimes arcane but always mission-critical world of risk management. Regulators globally are pushing financial institutions for more robust methodologies and models to manage the risks embedded in their balance sheets and operations.,2016-02-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Acquisitions,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-new-deal-in-risk,"A new deal in risk—our latest acquisition February 3, 2016 It’s a time of great change in the sometimes arcane but always mission-critical world of risk management. Regulators globally are pushing financial institutions for more robust methodologies and models to manage the risks embedded in their balance sheets and operations. Meanwhile, automation and digitization will change the tools and techniques at their disposal in ways that most banks, insurers, and asset managers are only just starting to embrace. Such is the background to our acquisition of Risk Dynamics , a leading risk analytics firm based in Brussels that specializes in risk model validation and advisory. “It would be an understatement to say that getting risk right is a priority for our financial sector clients,” says Cindy Levy , who leads McKinsey’s Risk Practice across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. While our Risk Practice comprises about 400 consultants—including a growing advanced analytics capability—the 35-strong Risk Dynamics team brings some unique capabilities to clients, including deep expertise in model validation, which is the critical business of stress-testing risk management models to ensure they are mathematically robust. The deal is a further sign of McKinsey’s willingness to make targeted acquisitions in order to accelerate bringing new services and expertise to clients. In December, the firm announced the acquisition of QuantumBlack , a London-based consultancy that is pioneering the use of big data to improve organizational performance. Other recent acquisitions have been in fields ranging from product design to pricing optimization. Risk Dynamics was founded in 2003 by Dominique and Olivier Bourrat, a wife and husband team with backgrounds respectively in quantitative finance and business consulting. Dominique earned a PhD in nuclear physics before moving into financial engineering at an investment bank and then risk management. Olivier, meanwhile, worked for international consulting firms in Belgium, Paris, and London. Risk Dynamics’ (metaphorical) marriage of quantitative skills, business insight, and innovative methodologies is one of the things that piqued McKinsey’s interest. “Their team includes some real quants but we’ve found them to be very insightful about the challenges facing the industry,” Cindy says. “They share the same ‘from the engine room to the board room’ approach we bring to clients.” Another shared interest is pushing the boundaries of knowledge to help clients manage new issues and regulations as they arise. As an example, Olivier points to “model landscape risk”—the headache-inducing challenge of understanding the interplay and governance of the dozens (or even hundreds) of different risk models being used within a single financial institution. Looking further ahead, Dominique notes that the emergence of machine learning and other computer-based forms of predictive analytics as something that financial institutions and their regulators will need to address: “It’s fine to build a risk model based on machine learning, but how do you validate it? That’s a question we are keen to help clients and regulators answer.” After the acquisition, Risk Dynamics will continue to operate from its Brussels offices, with its entire management team playing an active role in expanding the business globally under its existing brand. Early priorities include opening a US hub and embarking on an energetic recruiting effort. Cindy says: “Fundamentally, this is about building the world’s preeminent risk analytics and model advisory firm.” Never miss a story"

Grow smart. McKinsey principal Kara Sprague presenting research about high growth software  companies at a Technonomy conference. February 22, 2016 When big corporations are plotting growth strategies, their ambitions are often limited to growth rates in, say, the high single digits. For up-and-coming technology companies, that's a recipe for irrelevance—or worse. Only a very small percentage of tech start-ups manage to grow fast enough for long enough to become industry heavyweights. Of ~3,200 start-ups tracked in a recent McKinsey study , just 0.6 percent managed to hit $4 billion in annual sales. “If you're an early-stage tech company, and you're not growing fast enough, you're going to die a slow death. Oftentimes we see companies start to plateau—they stick around for a while hoping to regain their growth. But, in reality, very few do,” observes Kara Sprague, a San Francisco–based principal and member of our Growth Tech Practice . Kara studied computer science and electrical engineering at MIT and started her career as a software engineer. Today she helps small to midsize tech companies bring fact-based problem solving to their aggressive pursuit of growth. Clients are often entrepreneurs, running businesses employing 50 to 500 people, with revenues of $20 million to $200 million. Typically, they have developed and launched a successful product and are shifting their focus to achieving rapid scale. “We help them with the same growing pains our larger clients face: how to price products, how to improve sales effectiveness, how to operate more effectively,” explains Peter Weed, a principal in our Boston office. He founded the Growth Tech Practice with Eric Kutcher , a Silicon Valley-based director, with the specific aim of helping next-generation technology giants realize their potential. We’ve had to innovate our consulting model to meet the needs of these clients. Consulting projects typically run from 4 to 6 weeks instead of 3 months or longer. Project teams are smaller. The working style is decidedly different, too. “If you present a clear argument that’s backed up by data, CEOs can make a decision with little or no approval process. Within 5 minutes, it’s shared with the whole company,” says Adam Taylor, an associate principal in our Silicon Valley office who trained as a computer scientist and worked as an engineer in the video-game industry prior to joining McKinsey. While the Growth Tech Practice started in the United States, the model is being rolled out globally, including in India, Malaysia, and Scandinavia. As Eric Kutcher observes: “The next Google is as likely to be located in Brasilia, Shenzhen, or Tel Aviv as in California.” Sahana Sarma, another MIT-trained computer scientist turned McKinsey principal, is helping to build the practice in India, which has a thriving ecosystem of early-stage tech companies. “We are helping them navigate the complexities of operating in India as well as understand how they stack up internationally,” she says. Regardless of geography, pricing is often top of mind for Growth Tech clients because their products and services are first of a kind. As Adam recalls, “We helped one mobile-app company re-bundle its service to play in a higher-value segment. It was able to raise its price by 30 percent—because we could quickly build the fact base needed to test pricing.” Another Growth Tech client had some 40 strategic investments on the table—an embarrassment of riches that had become paralyzing. The McKinsey team facilitated a decision-making process to help the management team pare this down to a smaller set of initiatives and develop a clear story. With a well-articulated 3-year strategy, the company could raise the capital it needed to grow at a more attractive valuation. What do McKinsey’s multibillion-dollar tech clients make of our work with these (relative) minnows? Says Eric, “They want to know what the ‘ankle biters’ are doing. We can help them understand the trends, the new models, where the next big disruption may be coming from. In some cases, we can make helpful introductions.” Never miss a story"

More than 10,000 Indian and international companies converged on Mumbai for a week of exhibitions, seminars, and panel discussions. The goal: to draw global attention to the potential of India’s manufacturing sector. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid out a bold ambition to increase manufacturing’s contribution to India’s GDP from 14 percent to 25 percent by 2022—creating 100 million jobs in the process. Meeting this goal will require not only global investment in Indian manufacturing but also a commitment by Indian companies to increase the efficiency and sophistication of their operations. Our involvement with “Make in India” started with conversations with India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The ministry, desiring to recognize companies that were investing in high-quality manufacturing, had worked with editorial and business leaders at Time magazine to hatch a new set of awards for manufacturing excellence. So that the awards would be truly aspirational, they would be handed out at the summit by Prime Minister Modi. But how to screen the entries and develop a process for selecting winners? This is where McKinsey could help. With less than 3 months to build the awards process from scratch, the McKinsey team based in our Gurgaon office had to hit the ground running. The team was led by Rajat Dhawan , a director and leader of our Operations Practice in Asia. A chemical engineer by training, Rajat has worked with automotive, steel, and other manufacturers in China, Germany, India, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and beyond. “From the start, we all wanted the awards to measure not just the profitability of an enterprise, but also their business practices and capability to transform the world around them,’’ Rajat says. With this guiding principle in mind, the McKinsey team helped to define the award categories and eligibility criteria. Ashok Kumar, our senior expert, from the Asia Operations team, took the lead setting up a solid and transparent process. Ashok, formerly a commissioned officer in the Indian Air Force, knew he was running against the clock on this project. Time magazine, with our assistance, then invited nominations from a long list of companies that had recorded an economic profit over the past 5 years. Simultaneously, we helped assemble a jury to pick the winners. Norman Pearlstine, executive vice president and chief content officer for Time Inc., was our jury chair. The jury membership consisted of John Rice, vice chairman of General Electric; N. R. Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys; Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank; Carlos Ghosn, chairman and CEO of Renault-Nissan; Kevin Sneader , chairman, Asia, McKinsey & Company; and Rana Foroohar, assistant managing editor of Time. As the closing date approached, applications poured in for the three main awards: Best in Class Manufacturing (ultimately won by Tata Steel), Manufacturing Innovator of the Year (won by Hero Motor), and Young Makers of the Year (won by Yogesh and Rajesh Agrawal of Ajanta Pharma.) The winners received their crystal trophies from the prime minister at a glittering event in Mumbai. There was no crystal trophy for the McKinsey team—just plenty of pride at having helped kick-start a movement to manufacture better and more efficiently in India. Never miss a story"

From his home in South Africa, he travels widely across the continent, visiting not only the six other African countries in which we have offices but also an additional dozen or so in which we serve clients regularly. What’s more, he does it all on a Cameroonian passport, which, as he says ruefully, “doesn’t help me very much at all” when it comes to visa-free travel across African borders. Such headaches are familiar to most Africans doing international business on the continent. For all the talk of a pan-African passport, free movement for Africans within Africa remains a distant prospect. One finding from a recent African Development Bank Group (AfDB) report : It is easier for North Americans to travel within Africa than it is for Africans themselves. What’s more, only 13 out of 55 African countries offer liberal access—defined as visa free or visa on arrival—to all Africans. That’s bad news for a continent aiming for closer economic integration as a spur to trade, tourism, and economic growth. The AfDB report, produced with the help of McKinsey and the World Economic Forum, is the first to rank African countries according to the openness (or not) of their visa regulations for African citizens. At the top of the Africa Visa Openness Index are the Seychelles, Mali, Uganda, Cape Verde, and Togo. These countries have instituted either visa-free or visa-on-arrival policies for citizens of all African countries. “You can see the positive impact on the number of visitors to those countries,” says Acha. “Over time, you’ll also see it in the trade figures.” So why don’t more African countries open up? Security is one concern, despite evidence that visas aren’t a powerful deterrent to international terrorists. (More effective measures include biometric screening at points of entry and joining IT systems with other countries.) A more prosaic reason is that many embassies depend on visa fees for income. While this is surmountable—visa fees can be collected from visitors on arrival and channeled back to the relevant embassies—the potential hit to cash flow is a very real cause of resistance to change in the diplomatic corps. Perhaps most important of all, many governments fear that loosening visa restrictions will lead to an influx of cheap migrant labor. This helps explain why economic heavyweights such as South Africa and Morocco are in the bottom half of the openness index. Still, the African Development Bank hopes that tracking and ranking countries will stimulate constructive debate about the benefits of greater openness. The report highlights the example of Rwanda, where the reform-minded government implemented a visa-on-arrival policy for all Africans and halved the price of a visa to $30. Other bright spots include the Economic Community of West African States, which has a policy of open reciprocity among the 15 member states, which include Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal. If you hail from elsewhere in Africa, however, bad luck. National rules still apply. McKinsey as a whole has an enlightened self-interest in the topic. With more than 300 consultants based in our African offices—and a further 100 or so flying in regularly—it takes administrative heroics and hundreds of embassy visits every year to assemble the best teams on the ground for our clients. Says Acha: “Multiply this by millions to get a sense of why Africa has a problem.” Our seven offices on the African continent are: Angola Luanda ; Egypt Cairo; Ethiopia Addis Ababa ; Kenya Nairobi ; Morocco Casablanca ; Nigeria Lagos ; and South Africa Johannesburg .

But how can European governments implement reforms without losing popular support? To answer this question, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has launched a contest which offers a €100,000 prize pool for innovative ideas to stimulate economic growth while also winning the hearts and minds of European electorates: the MGI Essay Prize—An Opportunity for Europe . The idea for the prize germinated last year in the run-up to the publication of A window of opportunity for Europe , an MGI report that identified the potential for Europe to double its current growth rate and create more than 20 million jobs. While the analysis was powerful, the report’s authors (led by McKinsey directors Richard Dobbs , Eric Labaye , Sven Smit , Eckart Windhagen, and by MGI senior fellow Jan Mischke ) knew that more would be required to move policy makers to action. “The challenge is not just the analysis, but getting the debate going about what it would take to implement the required changes—hence a global prize,” Richard says. As Eckart puts it: “We wanted to get the flywheel going.” When the MGI team floated the idea of an essay contest with officials across Europe, the response was favorable—so favorable, in fact, that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker offered his patronage. It was this former prime minister of Luxembourg who in 2007 articulated the central dilemma essay authors will need to address: “We all know what to do, but we don’t know how to get reelected once we have done it.” In fact, as Eric points out, one of the findings of the MGI report was that the European public is keen to break out of the current frustrating economic cycle; a majority of the 16,000 Europeans polled for the report in eight countries said they were willing to make trade-offs in return for improved incomes and better public services. With the prize, Eric says, “We hope to create momentum by focusing on the practical ways this could be achieved.” The essay contest also intrigued Pascal Lamy, a former European trade commissioner and ex-director general of the World Trade Organization, who will serve as chairman of the judging panel . The other members of the jury reflect Europe’s economic, political, social, and geographical diversity. They include a German labor-union leader, Reiner Hoffmann; the business-affairs editor of The Economist, Andrew Palmer; the director of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) European Policy Office in Brussels, Geneviève Pons; and a Polish CEO, Ewa Szmidt-Belcarz. While McKinsey employees are not eligible to enter the contest, we encourage you to spread the word. Submissions are due by July 31, 2016, and the awards will be presented at a dinner in Brussels in October organized by MGI’s think-tank partner for the contest, Friends of Europe . In the meantime, look for flyers publicizing the contest at think tanks and universities across the Continent and join the conversation on social media with the hashtag #EssayforEurope . “We believe there are many good ideas, but not much of an open dialogue,” Sven says. “The prize could be a small catalyst to create conversations.” Never miss a story"
Reverse innovation gets real: Announcing the McKinsey Award winners,We&rsquo;re delighted to announce this year&rsquo;s winners for best article in the Harvard Business Review.,2016-03-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Awards,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/innovating-for-the-world,"Reverse innovation gets real: Announcing the McKinsey Award winners A user tests the Leveraged Freedom Chair, which was built using the principles of reverse innovation. March 22, 2016 We are delighted to announce the winner of the 57th annual McKinsey Award for the best Harvard Business Review article of the year: “ Engineering Reverse Innovation ,” by business school professor Vijay Govindarajan and engineering professor Amos G. Winter . While the concept of reverse innovation is not new ( Govindarajan’s 2012 book on the topic was a New York Times bestseller), companies still struggle to create successful products for emerging economies that can be rolled out globally. To help bridge the gap between aspiration and execution, the article lays out five principles that can be used by product development teams to facilitate the process. We sat down with the authors to learn more: Congratulations on winning the McKinsey Award, Vijay and Amos. Why is reverse innovation important to you? Vijay: It's very humbling to win this Award as it highlights the importance of the topic, that's what I'm most happy about. I was born and brought up in India. What I saw in India was lots of problems but very few resources. The only way to solve our problems was through innovation. We couldn’t throw money at the problems since we didn’t have the resources. So, when I came to Harvard Business School to study, I really committed myself to understanding all aspects of “innovation,” innovation for America, by American companies. When Jeff Immelt invited me to join GE as chief innovation consultant, he sent me to India and China to see how GE could grow in those two markets by converting “non-consumers” into consumers, we had to innovate more. For example, GE makes a $20,000 EKG (electrocardiogram) machine in the US. Ninety percent of Indian hospitals can’t afford it. That doesn’t mean non-consumers don’t suffer from heart attacks. Non-consumers in the world have exactly the same heart problems as consumers. Innovation can convert the former to the latter, which is what GE did: GE created a $500 EKG machine, which opened up the whole Indian market. That high-quality, low-cost machine has now been adopted in 90 countries, including rich ones. And that’s when I coined the term “reverse innovation.” Innovation doesn’t always have to start from a rich country and go to a poor country. It can also come in reverse—innovation can first be adopted in a poor country and then it can defy gravity and flow upwards. Jeff and I wrote an article about it in 2009. Since then, I’ve devoted a lot of my time and energy to that topic—which is how Amos found me. Amos: At MIT, my research group focuses on creating technologies for developing markets, and so we are doing reverse innovation all the time. We are motivated by the great humanitarian challenges as well as economic potential. We design to capture those opportunities, but we’re always looking at wealthy markets as well, and asking ourselves, “OK, if we can make a high-performance and low-cost solution, what would that look like in wealthy markets as well as poor markets, and can we design for both concurrently?” The Leveraged Freedom Chair project was motivated initially by the needs of users in the developing world, where the majority of people who need wheelchairs live in rural areas. There were no good products for users who need to travel long distances over rough ground while also having the maneuverability indoors of a small wheelchair. As Leveraged Freedom Chair started to get exposure, users in the US, Europe, and Canada started contacting us. It turned out they wanted one too. We realized that actually there were two distinct market opportunities for this technology. So we designed a version for more wealthy markets. We now serve these two groups of users, increasing their well-being while also trying to turn a profit. How did you come to collaborate? Amos: A few years ago, I read Vijay’s book Reverse Innovation. As a mechanical engineer who designs stuff for developing markets, I was blown away. But Vijay's book gives a strategy perspective. If you are the engineer tasked with designing a product for this new market, the book doesn’t give you a process for how to do reverse innovation. So, I approached Vijay and we immediately found that we were kindred spirits. As we talked, we both really liked the idea of trying to describe the steps to actually do reverse innovation if you are an engineer, and in describing the  overlapping standpoint of strategy in engineering. Vijay: How can a general manager have a meaningful conversation with an engineering team about the engineering principles behind reverse innovation? How do you organize the product development process to do it? We didn’t articulate these issues in the original article (with Jeff Immelt.) It’s a marvelous journey for me to work with Amos because every innovation is a marriage between technology and strategy. Amos is a professor of engineering and I’m a professor of business. Our coming together is an example of cross-disciplinary, cross-functional, university-wide collaboration which is going to be the hallmark of academia. Why do businesses struggle with reverse innovation? Amos : A few reasons: the first is that since World War II, product development has been focused on wealthy markets. As an American, designing a product for US customers, I have an inherent understanding of their needs because they are very similar to my own. But when I start trying to design for, say, a 50-year-old mother of five in Tanzania who's using a wood-fired stove every day, I have no inherent understanding of that person's context. It can be very difficult to design for that person, particularly if you are not interacting with him or her directly. The second reason is that companies that try to adapt existing products to developing economies often mistake value for cheapness. They think removing features and cutting prices will make their products appealing. But they start by stripping the value of the product, and users won’t want to buy it because it’s not good anymore. This approach hasn’t worked. So let’s instead start with these poor users and leverage the constraints they have to create very high-value technologies. A question I get all the time is, “Why not just design cheaper, better products for rich countries?” The answer is, because we don’t have to, because people are already buying our more expensive stuff in wealthier countries. In poor countries, it’s not optional to make a product that is higher performance and lower cost. It’s a must-have if you want to succeed. You may have to make the product more robust, you may have to make it strong enough to survive a bumpy road along the delivery chain. Vijay : Exactly. You see, I am so passionate about reverse innovation because it is one way by which we can address income inequality, the most important problem humanity faces today. Capitalists should use their capabilities and resources to innovate for the poor, thereby giving the poor income mobility. GE makes money off its highly affordable EKG machine, but at the same time GE is extending the productive life of a human being. When Amos innovated a low-cost wheelchair, he was also addressing income inequality. He’s giving someone in rural Africa mobility and the opportunity to earn more. Reverse innovation is about doing good while making money. If a corporation leverages its competencies to deliver shareholder return and at the same time addresses inequality, I think that has to be the highest form of human achievement. That is the potential of reverse innovation. What are you both working on now? Vijay: I’ve just finished a new book called The Three Box Solution . It’s the framework I’ve been using for the last 35 years. I put everything a company does into three boxes: Working with organizations, I find that they focus primarily on Box 1 which is all about operational excellence. While that’s important, Boxes 2 and 3 are equally important: they’re about growth and innovation. The challenge of leadership is how you create your future, while managing the present. Reverse innovation is an example of a Box 3 strategy. Amos: I'm working on a big problem in the developing world: agriculture. Globally, it’s the biggest employer, the biggest user of water—which is a really constrained resource in many poor countries—and one of the biggest users of electricity. My group is making solar-powered desalination systems that can function off the grid and desalinate brackish groundwater, because in India so much of the land has salty water in the ground. We’re working to make electrical grids hardier and the desalination process more energy efficient. We’re also working on low-cost, solar-powered drip irrigation systems that can enable farmers to grow more and higher value crops to rise out of poverty while minimizing water waste.

Responding to the global refugee crisis,"More than 59 million people globally are classified by the United Nations as &ldquo;forcibly displaced,&rdquo; the highest number since the Second World War.",2016-04-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/refugee%20crisis/blog_hero_1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/responding-to-the-global-refugee-crisis,"Responding to the global refugee crisis A McKinsey team, along with Bridge International Academies and non-profits Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Vitol Foundation , is developing a curriculum for  robust, low-cost tablets to help educate refugee children. April 6, 2016 More than 59 million people globally are classified by the United Nations as “forcibly displaced,” the highest number since the Second World War. The conflict in Syria alone has displaced at least 11 million people, around 4 million of whom have taken refuge outside the country. We’re working behind the scenes to support the responses of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and not for profits in many parts of the world. “This mass movement of people is more than a passing news story—it’s a global phenomenon that will have lasting effects,” says Khaled Rifai, a German-born, New York-based partner with Syrian roots, who is coordinating our work on refugee projects. When the scale of the crisis in Syria started to become clear, Markus Gstöttner, a consultant based in our London office, started looking for ways McKinsey could help. He recalls, “After several visits to the region and extensive research, it became clear that providing education for refugee children was an issue where our strengths as an institution overlapped with needs on the ground.” Today he leads a team of McKinsey volunteers on a project to deliver schooling to some of the 500,000 Syrian children who are refugees in neighboring Lebanon. The team, which includes Syrian and Lebanese colleagues, is working in partnership with education provider Bridge International Academies , local not for profit Basmeh & Zeitooneh , and Vitol Foundation , the nonprofit arm of the Dutch energy company. Working together, the group has developed a tailored curriculum that can be delivered to students by teachers using robust, low-cost tablets. “Faced with this number of children, there simply aren’t enough teachers available to deliver conventional schooling,” says Markus. “The Bridge platform can be used by volunteers who wouldn’t otherwise be able to teach. It provides structure and content right down to the level of scripts for individual lessons.” The model has been piloted with refugee children living on the outskirts of Beirut, and the team hopes to reach around 1,500 primary-school-age children directly by the end of this year. The curriculum is open source, enabling other organizations to use it to deliver education programs across Lebanon and eventually in other countries too. No less important, we’ve been working with the United Nations Development Programme, the UK government, and others to stimulate economic development in the region. In January, at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, we chaired a meeting of global business leaders hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Queen Rania of Jordan. Our work paved the way for a donor conference in February in London which resulted in monetary pledges of over $10 billion—the largest sum ever pledged on a single day. Of course the impact of the Syrian crisis is being felt outside the region too. European countries are struggling to deal with hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking asylum from war or opportunities for a more prosperous life. McKinsey teams are working with federal and regional government agencies to strengthen their capacity to respond. In the words of Kalle Bengtsson, a Stockholm-based partner who leads our Public Sector Practice in Western Europe, “Our mission is to serve our clients on their most challenging problems. For many European governments right now there is no bigger issue than balancing urgent humanitarian needs with the need to integrate refugees and migrants into society.” Never miss a story"

Meet our teardown experts 3-D printing is part of the design-to-value process at our Munich lab, allowing our experts to quickly fabricate components for prototypes. April 22, 2016 Tearing something down can sometimes be the most powerful way to build it up. For our design-to-value (DTV) experts, taking apart dishwashers, TVs, or wind turbines can yield important insights into how they are made—and lead to evidence-based recommendations for improvements. “Our lab sometimes feels a little like Pawn Stars (the History Channel show set in a second-hand store),” says senior expert Guillermo Lopez Velarde. “As they say at the beginning of the show, ‘You never know what’s gonna come through that door.’” Not long ago, a major consumer-goods player walked through the door with a product it felt was underperforming against the competition: a home-security device. The product was suffering from poor consumer reviews because of unreliability. The client hoped the DTV team might solve that problem and also improve margins by either reducing its cost or boosting its value. A conventional approach might look first at the product’s reliability issues and then later chase the margin opportunity. Design-to-value projects look at the product holistically, using design principles combined with deep engineering and supply-source insights. The DTV team began by figuring out what’s most important to consumers. Through customer-insights analytics combined with targeted product-performance tests, the team found that consumers valued reliability and adjustability over all other product features and attributes. “We could show the client hard data that the product was underperforming on both dimensions against competitors,” Guillermo says. Then, after disassembling the product and comparing it part for part against top competitors, the DTV team found significant opportunities to reduce costs and add value in the product’s mechanical and electronic components. “The product was overdesigned and not customer friendly,” says Guillermo. “We also learned that a particular sensor used by one competitor was better than the client’s. Switching to that sensor would improve reliability.” Finally, on the supply side, the DTV team uncovered cost-reduction opportunities from a sizeable gap between supplier prices and best-in-class “should cost” benchmarks. In the end, it all added up to dramatic improvements. Today the product earns four to four-and-a-half stars on online customer reviews and costs about 5 percent less to manufacture. We have nine DTV facilities spread across North America, Europe, and Asia. Each includes a teardown lab, a brainstorming area, and a product gallery. “Our largest European lab is in Munich, where we typically serve clients in the automotive and machinery sectors,” says senior expert Wolfgang Günthner, who leads our DTV projects across the continent. “We also just opened an expanded a cutting-edge lab in Wroclaw, Poland, where we specialize in cost engineering.” The lab in Munich also houses a large 3-D scanner and printer. “In one situation, we were able to scan a product and produce a modified model of it overnight, so that the client could see exactly what we were proposing,” says Wolfgang. “It’s an incredibly powerful tool.” As principal Dave Fedewa points out, however, DTV is more about people than high-tech gear. “The combination of depth and passion our people bring to the work is what really inspires clients to rethink their product designs. And there’s nothing that inspires the McKinsey team more than seeing a refreshed product hit the shelves.” Never miss a story"
Brain researcher takes on bias,Julia Sperling applies the latest findings in neuroscience to our work with clients around the world.,2016-04-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Diversity,Organization",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/brain-researcher-takes-on-bias,"Brain researcher takes on bias April 29, 2016 A medical doctor with a background in neuroscience, Julia Sperling knows what unconscious bias looks like. It’s a flash on a functional MRI, or a delayed reaction time on a test, or poor performance on a simple quiz. And it’s hurting our ability to make good decisions. Julia is the leader of our Middle East Healthcare Practice and a global leader in our Organization Practice . She’s also on the faculty of McKinsey Leadership Development , where she helps aspiring leaders see how their thinking is shaped by unconscious forces, and how they can overcome them. Just how did a medical doctor end up in the board room? “When I finished my dissertation, a McKinsey partner asked me where I wanted to be in 10 years. Did I still want to work in a laboratory, which at the time was in the basement of the university hospital? Or did I want to broaden my horizons, travel the world, influence decision-makers, and while doing all of this, truly impact the way people think and act in their fields? So I made my choice.” Julia joined our Frankfurt office in 2004. In business and public policy circles, interest in cognitive biases has been stoked by the work of prominent researchers such as Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman, author of recent bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow , who demonstrated how biases lead to sub-optimal decisions that are far removed from the perfectly rational choices assumed by classical economics. Research has shown not only how unconscious bias can be measured—using what researchers call ‘ implicit association testing ,’ for example—but also how it can be countered to achieve better results. One topic that fascinates Julia and her team is how these ideas can be applied to influence large groups of people—even entire populations—to achieve better outcomes. Measure your implicit gender bias with our implicit association test In addition to her work on health systems, Julia’s work focuses on shifting mindsets and behaviors by highlighting beliefs and biases that constrain personal growth, learning, and job performance. These include misconceptions about how the brain works, often popularized by bad journalism and now disproved by neuroscience. You may have heard that you’re either right- or left-brained. Wrong. Or that you only use 10% of the capacity of your brain. Nope. In fact, the latest research suggests that the brain is infinitely more capable of learning in myriad ways, with positive reinforcement, focus, and a “growth mindset”—“the belief that we can handle whatever life puts in front of us,” Julia explains. These discoveries in neuroscience have broad implications. Julia’s work is helping clients around the world uncover their own biases through capability building workshops and as part of our leadership development programs. Specifically, she works with companies in the Middle East to develop their female leaders and understand the issues faced by women in leadership roles across the region. “The view from the outside world that there are no female leaders in the Middle East is simply wrong,"" she says. “There are strong women taking leadership positions in government and private and social sectors. When I look at the courage, level of vision, and drive in many Saudi women, for example, I’m inspired.” On a personal level, has her work on unconscious biases helped Julia chart a course in her professional life? “Some advice I’ve received in the course of my career could have sent me in the wrong direction. Having more insights makes it easier to stay on course. The biggest danger is when people think they are being impartial but in fact carry deep biases.” Never miss a story"

May 27, 2016 by Vivian Hunt —Last week I was fortunate to join Women Deliver for its global conference in Copenhagen. Described as the biggest international development conference on women's and girls' rights and health in a decade, it was a great opportunity to share and test our latest research about how a more gender-equal society can promote a more gender-equal economy. The discussion paper we launched at the conference builds on research published last year by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), our economics think tank, which estimated a potential uplift to the global economy of $12 trillion in 2025 from narrowing the gender gap in the world of work. We learned two big things from our new research. The first is that the $12 trillion prize is achievable. In the discussion paper, we highlight six priority areas for action and investment: education, family planning, maternal health, financial inclusion, digital inclusion, and assistance with unpaid care. Second, the investment will be well worth it. We estimate that between $1 trillion and $2 trillion in incremental spending will be required across the six areas. That’s a return of six to eight times. The topic of unpaid care and domestic work is an important lever for closing the gender gap, in both developing countries and advanced economies. I spent 2 years living and working as a midwife in Senegal with the Peace Corps, the volunteer program run by the US government. I’ve seen how simple things like providing clean water and preparing the home for the day can take so much time for women and girls. In a different context, in a leading global city like London, where I live now, I see the trade-offs that parents make on parental leave in order to do the best for their families. In order to deliver the $12 trillion potential economic gain, we estimate that between 29 million to 57 million women, and an equivalent number of men, will need to be covered by paid family leave to enable women to work outside the home if they want to. Education is another key area. In Copenhagen I took part in a talk show alongside Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former Danish prime minister and current CEO of Save the Children . She talked about the importance of the progression of women from early childhood through education into work. To raise enrolment rates in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, 58 million more girls and 60 million more boys need access to secondary education. Since 2007, our ‘ Women Matter ’ research has explored the role women play in the global workplace, and gender equality is a major research topic for MGI. So it was great to be part of the conversation in Copenhagen with some of the key global voices on gender, including Melinda Gates, Graça Machel (minister of education and culture in Mozambique and widow of Nelson Mandela), Valerie Amos (former British politician and diplomat and UN undersecretary general) and Catherine M Russell (US ambassador-at-large for global women's issues). Anu Madgavkar , the MGI partner who led our latest research, was also at the conference and presented our findings in more detail. For me, the research validates what many of us instinctively believe to be true: in addition to the moral imperative, there could be a substantial economic return on investment if we deliver gender parity. We have a huge opportunity to unlock the potential of women, in society and in the economy. In the words of Women Deliver: “When the world invests in girls and women, everybody wins.” Never miss a story"

June 7, 2016 Our firm is sometimes described as “ a leadership factory ” because so many McKinsey alumni go on to play leadership roles elsewhere. What’s less widely known is that in many countries we also help create next-generation leaders by supporting mentorship and development programs for young people. Now in its ninth year, the Malaysia-based Youth Leadership Academy (YLA) is a great example of this approach. Each year the YLA team receives hundreds of applicants from Malaysian undergraduates, out of which 50 applicants are selected to participate. The 12-week YLA program includes workshops to develop skills such as problem solving and communications, as well as an opportunity to learn from some of Malaysia’s top leaders. Recent YLA mentors include Johan Merican, CEO of TalentCorp; Chen Chow, Co-Founder of KFit; Dzameer Dzulkifli, founder and managing drector of Teach for Malaysia and Nor Rejina Rahim, managing director of Nomura Asset Management Malaysia. At the heart of the program is a social entrepreneurship project in which students work in teams to come up with innovative solutions to societal challenges. Last year’s winning idea: Agritravels, a social enterprise which encourages eco-tourism to foster sustainability. “Agri-tourism is a great way to bridge the socio-economic gap between rural farmers and more affluent urban Malaysians,” says Amy Kok, a member of the Agritravels team. “More than anything, YLA gave me the confidence to believe in myself,” says Nurul Amalina Che Ariffin, a 2013 YLA participant. “Before YLA, I didn’t think I had it in me, now I’m determined to make a difference.” Since graduating from YLA, Amalina has founded Chili Padi Academy , a youth leadership movement, and followed her passion for human rights by training at a human rights law firm. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, McKinsey is a knowledge partner to Young Leaders for Indonesia , a six-month program to develop that country’s next generation of leaders. In Singapore, we partner with the Singapore International Foundation to mentor teams in the Young Social Entrepreneurs program. What’s in it for McKinsey? While graduates from these programs sometimes join our firm, we think about it in much broader terms. “Whether you’re talking about a company or a country, we know from our work with clients that leadership capability is really important to unlocking performance improvement,” says Li-Kai Chen , a partner in our Kuala Lumpur office. “We are helping to develop leadership capability for the countries in which we work, and we are continuously inspired by these passionate youth leaders.” Never miss a story"

June 17, 2016 The world over, young people are struggling to find employment. Joblessness is staggeringly high: globally, 75 million young people are unemployed, and three times as many are underemployed. As this generation gets older and feels the full weight of family responsibilities, they are increasingly denied the opportunity and earning potential of a career. Many companies, meanwhile, struggle to find applicants with the right skills to fill entry-level positions. McKinsey Social Initiative’s Generation program was created to address this paradox. Since its inception in 2014 with a program to train certified nurse assistants in Wilmington, Delaware, the program has expanded to India, Kenya, Mexico, and Spain, and to other cities within the United States. Young people have been trained for jobs in healthcare, technology, retail, and financial services. In each program, local employers partner with Generation to create a pathway to new jobs. The results so far are promising: as of today, Generation has reached 3,000 young people and is on pace to surpass 10,000 by the end of the year. Of those 3,000, 90 percent found a job at the end of the program. Ninety percent of employers say they would hire Generation students again. The true impact of Generation on the lives of its graduates is impossible to understand through statistics alone.

While the language is dated, the message still rings true: Most companies are scratching the surface when it comes to leveraging digital technology, and the buck stops with the CEO. The debut this week of the Digital McKinsey brand is just the latest stage of a decades-long mission to help our clients create real value with digital technology. Digital McKinsey brings together 2,100 experts from across our global firm—including more than 800 developers, designers , IT architects, data engineers, agile coaches, and advanced analytics experts in our Digital Labs —supported by an ecosystem of 300-plus alliances and partnerships. “The new name and visual identity are meant to help us communicate that we’re working with clients in new ways,” says Peter Dahlstrom , a senior partner in our London office who led the branding effort. “Today we’re not only advising but also building, operating, and transferring capabilities to help clients create value by reinventing the core of their businesses together.” What does this mean in practice? Helping a financial services client conceive, plan, and launch the country’s first digital-only bank. Helping one of the world’s biggest mobile operators transform customer experience with an award-winning and massively popular app. Building a digital center of excellence for a major travel company, with McKinsey people backfilling critical gaps in design, technology, and product management while we helped recruit permanent hires. What all these projects have in common is that the McKinsey team on the ground combined industry and functional experts with specialists who cut their teeth at ‘digital native’ companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Tencent. It’s a potent combination—and we’re not the only ones saying so. IDC and ALM Intelligence (formerly Kennedy Research) recently recognized us as leaders in digital strategy and innovation, with ALM’s analysts noting that we’ve got some of the deepest execution capabilities when it comes to designing, prototyping, developing, and launching digital products and services. We’re also bringing hardcore technology to the table. The earlier generation of McKinsey technologists such as David Hertz, a mathematics Phd and operations research pioneer would surely have celebrated our acquisition of QuantumBlack , a trailblazer in using Big Data and machine learning to drive performance improvements in business operations. “The majority of companies will need to transform their digital operations in the next three to five years,” says Alan Lau, a Hong Kong-based senior partner co-leading Digital McKinsey in Asia with senior partner Gregor Theisen . “We’ve found that three out of four CEOs want to champion digital and are ready to move forward.” Sound familiar? To be sure, the digital paradigm has been through multiple shifts since the 1970s heyday of mainframes and FORTRAN. What never gets old is the need for a digitally-savvy partner who can help senior executives drive change in the core of the business. Never miss a story"

With 2 months to go until the closing date for 2016 entries, we caught up with three of last year's finalists to check on their progress from proposal, to manuscript, to business book. Chris Clearfield and András Tilcsik took top honors in the 2015 competition with their proposal for a book about how to understand systemic risk and prevent catastrophic failures in business and beyond. The Bracken Bower judges were not alone in taking a shine to the idea. “A publisher saw an excerpt [from our proposal] on the Financial Times website and got in touch the day after the prize dinner,” recalls András, a professor at the Rotman School of Management. Instead of taking the first offer, however, Chris and András worked with their agent to sharpen the proposal. Says Chris: “We’ve spent a lot of time revising our proposal to serve a broader audience. We’re looking for a way to share the ideas as widely as we can.” In March, they signed with Penguin to publish Meltdown in the US and Canada, and have since struck deals to publish in China, Korea, the UK, and elsewhere. Follow their blog to learn more. The two friends had long been looking for an opportunity to collaborate, a relationship that allowed them to push each other through the writing process. “Once Chris wrote 1,000 words, I had to do the same,” recalls András. The Bracken Bower deadline was a motivating force. “It is always hard to do something on top of work. I never really considered quitting, but that’s of course the irony of this whole thing. Writing a book on quitting takes a lot of persistence.”–Jonathan Hillman, 2015 Bracken Bower Finalist Any tips for people thinking of entering this year? “Get input from trusted friends who are willing to give honest feedback. Our first draft was worlds away from the proposal that we submitted,” said Chris a former Wall Street trader and founder of risk consulting firm System Logic . “Start early,” advises András, who studies how organizations make decisions. “So you can revise and revise and revise.” We caught up with Irene Sun as she returned from several weeks of seclusion in rural Massachusetts working on a manuscript. Irene found an agent soon after being announced as a Bracken Bower finalist. Her book proposal focused on China’s increasing presence in Africa. The final manuscript of The Next Factory of the World is due with her publisher, Harvard Business Review Press, this fall. The idea for the book arose from Irene's personal experience living and working in Africa. “I am Chinese, so Chinese people would come up to me and ask ‘What are you doing?’ In return, I would ask what they were doing. They were building railways, dams, roads, or opening businesses. I could see this was going to really change Africa.” Her advice for future Bracken Bower applicants? “It's a proposal, not a finished book. You don’t have to have it all figured out.” After submitting her manuscript, Irene is joining McKinsey in Washington DC, although we should point out that current employees of McKinsey or the FT aren’t eligible to apply for the prize. Jonathan Hillman's shortlisted book proposal, The Fog of More, dealt with the value of strategically quitting jobs, investments, and projects. Earlier this year Jonathan signed with Javelin, an agency based in Washington DC, and this month submitted a revised proposal to publishers. “When you are just starting out as an author, you don’t really have much to point to, so I think [being shortlisted] made a huge difference,” he says. “It validated what I'd like to do for this next period of my life, which is to do my own research and writing.” Jonathan recently started a new job as a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , where he directs a project on infrastructure in Eurasia. This highlights a challenge common to many aspiring writers: finding the time and energy to write while also working full time. While the book remains a work in progress, he’s already enjoying seeing his ideas in print. Financial Times columnist Andrew Hill recently wrote about the virtue of knowing “ when to pull the plug on a failed project ,” citing Jonathan’s Bracken Bower proposal. Never miss a story"

August 12, 2016 As a child growing up in Indonesia, Jessica Lembong loved American candy bars. Whenever she traveled abroad, stocking up Cookies n’ Crème candy bars was a favorite pastime. Encouraged by her parents to become a global citizen, she went on to study and work in the US for 15 years, obtaining a PhD in chemical engineering as well as indulging a weakness for sugary treats. Now back home in Indonesia as an associate partner based in our Jakarta office , Jessica has trained her scientific mind on a sticky problem: how unhealthy lifestyle habits, among other factors, could wreak havoc on the country’s healthcare system and economic future. Together with colleagues from McKinsey’s global Healthcare Systems & Services Practice , she was the driving force behind our recent report Tackling Indonesia’s diabetes challenge: Eight approaches from around the world . Jessica returned home to Indonesia just as Southeast Asia’s largest economy was embarking on a fundamental reform of its healthcare system. With encouragement from McKinsey’s leadership team, she was determined to find a way for the firm to contribute. Diabetes quickly emerged as a topic that was not only important for the country but also one to which McKinsey could bring deep expertise. “Globally we have helped industries and governments to think through how to address [chronic diseases] from a welfare perspective and also from a cost perspective,” she says. “Plus the McKinsey Global Institute had invested a lot of time learning about obesity .” The opportunity was not lost on Kaushik Das , a senior partner who leads McKinsey in Indonesia: “McKinsey is deeply invested in Indonesia and we want to help shape the future of the country on multiple dimensions. Whether we’re working in the corporate sector or the public sector part of what we bring is an understanding of best practices from around the world.” Once diabetes had been selected as the topic for investigation, Jessica’s instincts for problem-solving went into high gear. The McKinsey team pursued complex questions in three main areas: What are the persistent factors behind Indonesia’s vulnerability to diabetes? What lessons could Indonesia learn from other countries in addressing non-communicable diseases? And how should Indonesia’s policy makers develop and execute a diabetes-management strategy? The experience, she says, was exhilarating. While she had enjoyed academic work tremendously, she found her true calling in an environment where she could collaborate with a broad set of thinkers and experts with diverse backgrounds. She recalls: “I enjoyed my PhD years very much. But there are a few things I did not get from it. One is I felt very lonely, being very deep on a specific topic where I could problem-solve really well with my advisor and my lab mates, but there aren’t a lot of other people in the world that I could discuss [things with].” Jessica also found that she had a deep desire for shaping outcomes with decision-makers. “I longed for a more direct and a more at-scale impact through the things that I do.” At McKinsey she found ample opportunity to talk to “teammates, experts, clients, and bring different perspectives to a problem on a daily basis. To me that is really rewarding.” At 33, Jessica’s journey of discovery has a long way to go. For now she appears to have found her sweet spot. Never miss a story"
Battling polio in Nigeria,"In 2012, Nigeria was the worst performing polio endemic country in the world, before the government and its international partners used an innovative approach to drastically reduce the number of cases.",2016-08-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/battling%20polio%20in%20nigeria/1971571337001_5097246926001_5097150573001-vs.jpg,"Social Impact,Healthcare,Africa",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/battling-polio-in-nigeria,"Battling polio in Nigeria August 26, 2016 This summer, Nigeria was set to mark 2 years without a single case of polio. In just 12 more months, the country, and the continent of Africa, stood to be declared polio free. Unfortunately, on August 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed two new cases of polio , in the northeast of the country, in areas recently liberated from insurgents. Two children were left paralyzed. Nigeria and its international partners have mounted a response to meet this new challenge. While this news is a setback to Nigeria’s fight to eradicate polio, it does not diminish the scale of the turnaround the country accomplished in recent years. At the core of the country’s achievement was the mobilization of government officials, healthcare workers, and millions of citizens. McKinsey partner Scott Desmarais worked closely with these groups as the leader of a McKinsey team that supported the effort to fight polio. In this short film, Scott explains how the government went about turning the situation around in such a short time. Interview We also spoke with Scott and former consultant Emmanuel Magani about their experiences on the project. Until recently, Scott was based in Lagos , where he worked in developing economies for more than 20 years. Emmanuel grew up in Kano, a region crucial for the project, based in Lagos. How did McKinsey get involved in the fight against polio? Scott Desmarais: In 2012 we started talking with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation about putting together an emergency operation center (EOC) to help oversee the polio-eradication effort in Nigeria. It was very entrepreneurial. The EOC was a brand-new concept and it was a critical opportunity for our recently opened office in Lagos to support Nigeria and its international partners on this global priority. We helped launch the national polio EOC in Abuja before we even had a building, an office, or anything. We were involved until July 2015, when we rolled off our last consultants, but continue to stay close to our colleagues at the EOC. Was the goal always to eradicate polio from Nigeria? Emmanuel Magani: In Lagos, polio wasn’t at the top of people’s minds. Polio had been eradicated there for years—but not in the northern fringes of the country, which includes Kano, the city where I grew up. None of my relatives had it, but the signs are obvious all over town. One of the things about polio is that it usually affects kids below age five, and they are crippled for life. If you go to Kano you see many of these kids. A lot of them, unfortunately, end up as beggars on the street. Just a shot of vaccine and they could have had completely different lives. Scott Desmarais: Yes. Nigeria had made some progress with polio. . . and then suffered some setbacks. By 2012 it had fallen behind other countries, including those at war, such as Afghanistan. It was clear that Nigeria needed to take a different approach, and the government decided it wanted to turn things around. Going nearly 2 years without any new cases was an important step toward eradication. But as the recent cases in Borno State demonstrate, eradicating polio is a war with many battles. The government and its international partners will need to continue to demonstrate their determination to persevere in the remaining areas where polio is trying to make its final stand. What have the EOCs achieved? Scott Desmarais: It’s important to recognize what the Nigerian government was able to accomplish fighting polio in 3 years. Having built the EOC capability, they have been able to use that in their response to the recent cases in the northeast of the country. Nigeria was also able to leverage its learnings from its polio EOCs to rapidly establish an Ebola EOC in Lagos that successfully eradicated Ebola in only 3 months (including the WHO required 42-day period without any new Ebola cases). What about the recent cases in the northeast of the country? Scott Desmarais: We always knew there was a risk that polio remained in areas in the northeast of the country. Insurgent groups made some areas unreachable for vaccinators. Populations were being displaced, and moving around, many of the families were migrating to camps; some of them were coming into the capital or other cities in the region—all making it even more difficult to track progress and design new approaches to further reduce the number of missed children and to increase levels of polio immunity. We worked with amazing doctors and specialists from Nigeria’s National Primary Health Care Development Agency , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and WHO and with international polio experts to dig into the limited data that were available—and come up with innovative approaches to go out and find the children and immunize them. These included “hit and run” campaigns, where the EOCs would get a sense from the Nigerian military or the local community when it would be safe to go into specific areas and vaccinate children. Vaccinators would rush in for a day or two and vaccinate as many children as they could, and then touch base with the community to get the word out. The EOCs also found ways to set up health camps in these unstable areas. The camps would provide basic healthcare to families, which included polio vaccinations. What were the biggest challenges your team faced? Emmanuel Magani: Nigeria has a national health system, but what was missing was the ability to collect, analyze, and track data at the local level, in the areas where there were polio outbreaks. That meant it was harder to target vaccination campaigns. So in Kano, we were part of a team that included the federal and state governments, WHO, UNICEF, and others, and we found a way to ensure better coordination to see exactly where we should focus our efforts. This meant people had to adjust to a new way of doing things. It took a bit of back and forth to get everyone on the same page. Scott Desmarais: Another challenge was the security situation. The EOC in Kano had only been operational for a few months when insurgents from the north murdered nine local polio volunteers, all of whom were young women administering vaccinations door to door. These volunteers were playing such an important role. Following the attacks, Nigeria’s president and some state ministers were in Kano visiting the wounded members of the vaccination team. The president walked up to one of the young women, who had been shot in the leg, thanked her for her dedication to fighting polio, and asked her, “What are you going to do next?” The young woman said, “As soon as I’m better, I’m going right back out there and rejoining my sisters on this campaign to honor those who died helping us to get rid of polio forever.” Emmanuel, you’re an engineer by training. How did you come to work on this project? Emmanuel Magani: In fact, I was one of the first consultants on the project, and it was one of my first projects for McKinsey. Since much of the work was happening in Kano State, it was critical to have someone who understood the Hausa language and the culture, which is different from other parts of Nigeria. The town of Kano has a Muslim majority, with a distinct culture. When we went to meetings, it wasn’t uncommon that they would start off with a prayer. It was an advantage to have someone comfortable and familiar with the cultural norms. What moments will you remember most from this project? Scott Desmarais: It was a privilege to work with the government and its international partners to establish the EOCs. It’s absolutely critical that we give credit where credit’s due. The Nigerian government—at both the federal and state levels—has accomplished something tremendous. We were proud to support them, the Gates Foundation, and all of our partners, WHO, UNICEF, the CDC, and Rotary International. Our team was just a supportive cog in this machine that actually went out and got the job done in the face of adversity. The relationships we have built here are very strong. I also want to recognize the large number of McKinsey colleagues who dedicated themselves to helping eradicate polio in Nigeria over the past several years. Never miss a story"
Welcome to Serbia: Our newest office,"This summer we opened the first McKinsey office in Serbia. The new Belgrade office is the ninth McKinsey location in our Central and Eastern Europe region, alongside Bratislava, Bucharest, Budapest, Kyiv, Moscow, Prague, Warsaw, and Zagreb.",2016-09-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Offices,Europe",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/welcome-to-serbia-our-newest-office,"Welcome to Serbia: Our newest office The opening ceremony of the Belgrade office with global managing partner Dominic Barton, on the right, and colleagues from Belgrade, Bucharest, and Zagreb. September 1, 2016 This summer we opened the first McKinsey office in Serbia. The new Belgrade office is the ninth McKinsey location in our Central and Eastern Europe region, alongside Bratislava , Bucharest , Budapest , Kyiv , Moscow , Prague , Warsaw , and Zagreb . Economically, Serbia is well positioned in the region, with access to over one billion consumers through free-trade agreements and an advanced road network. It’s also strong in several sectors, such as agriculture and food and IT services, which are predicted to see growing demand over the coming decades. And the country is moving toward membership in the European Union. The McKinsey team in Belgrade combines Serbian talent with experience drawn from elsewhere in the region. The leadership team comprises Boris Dragovic and Dusan Komar—both born in Serbia—and Jurica Novak from Croatia. All three were educated partly overseas. Boris and Jurica have PhDs from Cambridge University (in computer science and nanoscale physics, respectively). Dusan received his master’s degree from the London School of Economics. Adding to the regional flavor, Jurica will split his time among Belgrade and our offices in neighboring Bucharest and Zagreb. A common theme across the region is that many of our private-sector clients are somewhat smaller than is typically the case in Western Europe. This calls for flexibility on our part. Belgrade-based consultants work in teams on projects large and small, helping local companies navigate increased competition in their home markets while taking advantage of growth opportunities in international markets. The mix of clients includes players in financial services, oil and gas, telecommunications, and basic materials, among other sectors. Now that the office is officially open, what’s in store for the rest of this year and beyond? Hiring and developing Serbian talent is a big priority. The “brain drain” of the 1990s saw many students and professionals move overseas from Croatia, Serbia, and other Balkan countries to escape conflict and economic chaos. Jurica was among them, in the early 1990s, when he moved from Zagreb to rural Michigan for his final year of high school before heading to Cornell and then to Cambridge. “Back then, the only way to be competitive was to graduate from a US high school,” he recalls. Times have changed. Serbia, in particular, has emerged as a talent hub for the region, with more than 240,000 students enrolled in higher education. While we won’t be hiring in the hundreds or thousands, we hope to be advising the companies that do. Never miss a story"

Founded 16 years ago, PriceMetrix today holds data on 60,000 financial advisers across North America—everything from the types of clients they serve to the financial products they recommend and the commissions and fees they receive. Sliced, diced, and presented in smart ways, this enables companies to better understand and manage their advisory networks. The company has invested heavily in proprietary models—some of which are patent-protected—and in online tools to deliver insights to executives, field managers, and advisers themselves.  “There are a lot of exciting opportunities to get analytics into the hands of people on the front line,” says Patrick Kennedy, co-founder and chief customer officer. By “democratizing” its analytics in this way, PriceMetrix has established itself in one of the tech sector’s most fashionable neighborhoods—software-as-a-service (Saas). The company will retain its brand, separate identity, and management team , led by co-founder/president Doug Trott. For McKinsey, the acquisition further swells the ranks of data engineers, analytics experts, and technologists at work across our firm. In the wealth management sector alone, we’ve already developed a powerful suite of technology-enabled tools and solutions including Global Growth Cube (for market-sizing and strategy), Sales Alpha (marketing and sales effectiveness), and our flagship Global Asset Management Survey (which facilitates benchmarking across 8,000 operational metrics). For clients, the opportunity lies in combining McKinsey industry expertise and tools with PriceMetrix analytics. “Competitive pressures and regulatory changes make this a particularly relevant time for our clients,” says Jill Zucker, a New York-based partner and leader of our Wealth Management Practice in North America. “We’ll be using our combined tools, analytics, and knowledge to help industry leaders on issues relating to performance management, compliance, and pricing.” Never miss a story"

Key findings from the Lions on the move II report were presented to an audience of heads of state, government leaders, and CEOs by Dominic Barton, our global managing director, and Acha Leke , a senior partner based in Johannesburg. When the first Lions report was published 6 years ago, almost all African countries were experiencing rapid economic growth. Today, the picture is more complex. Major oil exporters have seen growth slow, as have countries involved in the Arab Spring. Nevertheless, there are good reasons for optimism: In the words of US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, who cohosted the New York forum along with Bloomberg Philanthropies, “The report highlights the positive long-term growth potential of economies across the African continent.” These positive trends explain why we’ve continued to expand across the region. Our Lagos office opened in 2010, just prior to the publication of the first Lions on the move report. Since then we’ve opened in Nairobi and Addis Ababa, adding to a network of locations that also includes Johannesburg , Luanda , and Casablanca. Our Africa Practice has been serving clients across the continent for more than 20 years. On the ground, there’s a palpable sense of excitement about the opportunities to help improve the economic well-being and quality of life of millions of Africans, says Paul Jacobson , a consultant in our Johannesburg office who helped lead the research behind the new report. “When we were setting up for this project, I was inundated by requests from colleagues who wanted to be part of the team.

Last week the effort took a big step forward with the creation of FCLT Global , a new independent non-profit backed by a coalition of founding supporters (BlackRock, CPPIB, Dow Chemicals, Tata Sons, plus McKinsey) and member organizations from nine countries. At the helm of FCLT Global is Sarah Williamson , a McKinsey alum who has held senior roles in investment banking and asset management. She believes the organizations supporting the effort increase the opportunity for impact. “Our members are serious players in the system,” she says. “With their weight behind the initiative, we can do more than just develop insights into the problem, we can have lasting impact on changing behaviors.” Speaking at last week’s launch event, BlackRock executive and FCLT Global chairman Mark Wiseman described the new non-profit as “a do tank, not a think tank,” working to develop practical tools that organizations can use. Unveiled at the same event, our latest research for FCLT Global suggests that pressure on companies to run their businesses with a short-term focus is actually increasing. Responding to our survey, 87 percent of business leaders said they felt most pressure to demonstrate financial results within two years, up from 79 percent two years ago. Conor Kehoe, a McKinsey senior partner who led early research on long-termism which led to the establishment of FCLT, is not surprised by these findings: “Many public companies boards say they sometimes forgo value-creating investments to protect short term earnings. And the pattern of investment is dramatically different between public and private companies matched for size and industry. Private companies invest more and their investment is much less distorted by a desire to meet short-term profit targets.” As Sarah points out, these distortions have implications far beyond the executive suite: “Long-term investments by companies in things like innovation and job creation mean that future generations can be better off. If companies are excessively short-term in their decision-making this may no longer be the case.” For our latest thinking on this topic, please visit our Long-term Capitalism collection page .

From left to right, Eric Labaye, Henrik Enderlein, Pascal Lamy, Dan Ciuriak, Volker Brühl, Antoine Levy, Ewa Szmidt-Belcarz, Geneviève Pons-Deladrière, Sven Smit, and Étienne Davignon. October 13, 2016 This week, McKinsey Global Institute proudly announced the winners of its first-ever MGI Opportunity for Europe essay prize. Out of 401 submissions from as far away as New Zealand, a blind judging panel helmed by Pascal Lamy, former secretary general of the World Trade Organization and a former European commissioner, chose the three winners. MGI gathered the winners on Tuesday night in Brussels to celebrate. The winners focused on different aspects of Europe’s political economy. Dan drew on his wide-ranging 31-year-long career as a public servant in Canada—most recently as the deputy chief economist in the Department of Foreign Affairs—to propose a variety of policies. “When you’re a deputy economist in a trade department, you do everything,” he explained. “There’s a lot of room for the cross-fertilization of ideas.” “We’ve been having jobless recoveries, and it’s because the use of low interest rates has been pricing labor out of the market.” Thus, he calls for a debt jubilee, wherein the European Central Bank could buy up public debt and then cancel it. This, according to Dan, would “allow fiscal policy to get back into the game of macroeconomic stabilization.” He is eager for policy makers to get away from the supply side and back into the demand side of economics. “When I retired,” Dan recalled, “my objective was to take up the cello, but the world came calling, and one thing lead to another.” His consulting company grew, involved him heavily in European issues, and took him to the European conference circuit, where discussions about growth and innovation swirled, in particular, examining how the European Union could replicate the successes of the United States’ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Dan devotes a portion of his essay to addressing this question. As he explains it, “if my computer were operating as poorly as the European economy is, I would shut down and reboot it.” Volker is grateful that the contest is drawing much-needed attention to the future of the European economy. “I am convinced of the European idea, and my interest in the topic is both personal and professional.” He plans to continue refining and researching the issues raised in his essay. As a 23-year-old French national, Antoine understands the ambivalence that many in his generation feel toward those in power. “There’s a tension between the daily benefits of living in the EU, like the ability to travel and study abroad, and then feeling excluded from decision making. In some sense, we feel taken hostage by others who have kicked the can down the road and avoided making the hard decisions.” Are the three winners hopeful for the future? “I am always optimistic,” Volker said. He believes that leaders in Brussels and at the national level can find a way forward to more growth. He adds, however, “This is certainly not an easy task given the heterogeneous economic landscape in Europe.” According to Dan, Europe is kept at disequilibrium “because we have policy blinkers on that lead us to rule out the path to a better equilibrium. But we know what that better equilibrium looks like—the dynamic European economy of the early 2000s. We need a policy paradigm shift to get there, but we have seen such policy paradigm shifts before, and I see no reason why we can't engineer another one.” For Antoine, it’s not a question of hope. “I think hope is not a sufficient condition—we need to stop with wishful thinking and hoping for the end result—and start working on the processes for how to get there.” You can download a booklet containing a discussion of the context and objectives of the prize, the report from judging-panel chair Pascal Lamy, a summary of key themes in the essays, and the full text of the three winning entries. Jyrki Katainen, vice president of the European Commission, wrote a foreword. The prizes were awarded on October 12 at a dinner in Brussels hosted by Friends of Europe, MGI’s think-tank partner for the contest. Never miss a story"

In the 1990s, Collin founded frog design ’s digital practice. He joins McKinsey from   Carbon12 Creative, an Austin, Texas, design firm where he was CEO. Collin’s former Carbon12 colleagues are also joining us, adding studios in Austin and Mumbai to our global design footprint. We spoke with Collin about design, consulting, and why he was excited to make the move. What does “design thinking” mean to you? Design has matured from brand-driven visual styling to human-centered problem solving. For me, design thinking combines top-down business analysis with bottom-up technical possibilities, while adding a deep consideration for the actual people who will be touched by the solution. It involves end users as a fundamental part of the process to discover and serve their unmet needs. It’s not enough to make things that look great. It’s also not enough to just “design for the end user.” In a business context, implementing great design must engage all parts of a company to rethink its core products and services. So design thinking is not just for designers. It’s a multi-disciplinary process that brings together business people, technologists, operations, designers, and end users. How does working at a consulting firm like McKinsey compare to a design studio? So far I’ve been impressed with how nimble and entrepreneurial McKinsey is, despite being 90 years old! It’s amazing to see the firm’s ability to change and adapt. The acquisition of LUNAR was a signal that McKinsey is serious about bringing top design talent to its clients. Why do you think your design colleagues from Carbon12 also opted to join McKinsey’s Digital team? Joining McKinsey is an amazing opportunity for all of us. It’s a chance to help grow and shape McKinsey's work in this space, and define what design means for some of the world’s leading organizations. Designers by nature are passionate, idealistic, and optimistic people. We want to do meaningful work that makes a difference. With Carbon12 colleagues joining us, we have added design studios in Austin and in Mumbai. Why are these two locations important for McKinsey? Mumbai is a gateway to the most amazing growth opportunities of the next 50 years. Our Mumbai studio is perfectly positioned to serve India, as well as the rest of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. We have the opportunity to build a team that combines best practices of design and consulting with a deep, native understanding of these high-growth regions. Why is digital design such an exciting area to be in right now? Digital technologies are creating change across all industries—how businesses and people interact, communicate, and work. Design helps identify and shape those opportunities. It puts a human lens on technology, making it accessible, meaningful, and more personal. Uber is a great example of this crossover between digital and design. It uses a set of digital technologies and mobile communications to connect drivers and customers —without the traditional overhead of real estate, fleet assets, or driver employees. And yet, it has disrupted and redefined an entire industry. Design helped to see that potential and define how it would fit into people’s lives, all while meeting a need that might have been hard for users to articulate before the solution was put into their hands. Digital technology enabled the opportunity, and design brought it to life. Why are design capabilities and design thinking critical areas for companies today? It’s a cliché but it’s true: We’re living in a world of rapid change, where steady growth and incremental improvements aren’t enough. Companies need to think differently, work differently, and serve customers in new ways. Design is a great catalyst. It helps us reframe problems and discover exciting new opportunities. related Designers at McKinsey—vive la différence! Never miss a story"

November 11, 2016 What’s the common thread connecting IKEA’s Home Smart range of furniture, which incorporates wireless charging stations, and Gillette’s smooth ProGlide razors? Both were researched and codesigned with the client by Veryday, an award-winning Swedish design agency—and our latest acquisition. As with the purchase last year of California-based LUNAR, the deal adds new talent to McKinsey Design and enables us to help more clients grow more quickly by creating amazing new products and services. “We were searching for a design firm with an unquestionable reputation and world-class designers,” says Volker Grüntges, the Munich-based senior partner who led the acquisition from the McKinsey side. “Veryday is ahead of the curve because its work combines physical product design, service design, and an engaging experience. The convergence of physical and digital, of products and services, is a huge opportunity for a lot of our clients.” Founded in 1969 as Ergonomidesign, the agency changed its name to Veryday only recently, in 2012. The shift reflected the changing nature of its work, says Niclas Andersson, chief business officer; projects now are about product service and digital interaction. The Veryday name is a nod to Sweden’s history of affordable, universal design: “We always strive to improve the ordinary every day.” There’s nothing ordinary about the agency’s record. Veryday has won more than 240 awards, and new products it designed have been granted more than 300 patents. In 2014, the firm was selected as Red Dot Design Team of the Year, an internationally recognized honor previously awarded to the likes of Apple, BMW, and Porsche. After the acquisition, the agency will retain its management team and the Veryday name. Its 90-plus designers, researchers, and other colleagues in Stockholm and New York will continue to serve long-standing clients while working with
McKinsey teams on joint opportunities. They will also be getting to know their new colleagues at LUNAR, plus the deep bench of design talent assembled by our Digital Labs . In Stockholm, the firm’s designers will continue working from the 19th-century former church rescued and renovated by the Veryday team. Volker had the pleasure of visiting several times as the two companies got to know each other. “It’s a real mix of community and professional space,” he says. “It has soul.” Never miss a story"

His recently published article, Transforming government through digitization , describes opportunities for governments globally to deliver better, more efficient, and more responsive public services. Why did you leave government and politics? In many ways it was a natural point of change for me. Although I’m still quite young relative to the average age of politicians, I’d spent my whole working life in Danish policymaking and the civil service. After four years as finance minister—a period of “ reform frenzy ,” as our prime minister described it—it felt like the right time to look for a new learning curve to climb. The other factor is that I’ve always fought against the tendency for policymakers to shut themselves off from the private and social sectors. In government I made it a personal mission to challenge this attitude. We changed the appointment procedure for the top levels of the civil service to make it more open to outside candidates. I think you get better decisions when there are easy and fluid transitions in and out of government. So I wanted to live out my persuasion on this issue. What did you learn from your period as finance minister? Something that’s not always apparent is how difficult it is to implement policies that create a level playing field, achieve a fair prioritization of public resources, and take into account the long-term interests of future generations. If these are your goals as a minister, your position is actually quite weak compared to special interests or people with short-term, opportunistic positions. To win you have to be technically very well equipped and very patient. Of course, you should never underestimate the role of political leadership and courage. But there is also a technical side to this as well. Even the most courageous, boldest political leader won’t be able to implement successful reform without the right technical tools, an informed approach, and an awareness of best practices. Government is not only about politics and ideology, it is also about a certain craftsmanship of policy. As a government minister you have a lot of technical resources at your disposal—civil servants, think tanks, academics. What does McKinsey bring to the table in this context? More than anything I think it is an ability to connect the dots. There’s a lot of knowledge here [within McKinsey], a lot of experience globally, a lot of innovative partnerships. As a policymaker it is very helpful to be able to draw on this kind of global perspective. The other special thing about McKinsey is that the knowledge comes from experience doing real work on the ground with high stakes and tight deadlines. It’s not just theory. Everything here is tested against reality and that’s truly unique. As you talk to government leaders around the world, are there one or two common issues they are all facing? I see most governments facing a very similar set of challenges. Citizens are expecting more. Their demands are becoming more complex, more individualized. Developments in the private sector are raising their expectations. At the same time, governments are under economic pressure—in some cases, under quite extreme pressure. The only way forward is to deliver “better for less.” To do that you have to change the way government operates. That’s the challenge. The optimistic side of the equation is that options are available—options to use technology and digitization, to deploy analytics, to adopt best practices in public-finance management, and so on. We talk about some of these opportunities in the new article. So even though there is a lot of pressure and skepticism about what government can deliver, there are options out there. The truth is the quality of governance and government makes an underestimated difference to the performance of nations and the well-being of citizens. Never underestimate the importance of good government. Never miss a story"

November 23, 2016 Eight years on, the legacy of the financial crisis continues to reverberate, in economics and politics. How did it happen? What lessons can we learn? The winner of this year's Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year award, Sebastian Mallaby 's The Man Who Knew , adds to the debate by recounting the pivotal role played by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. The award was presented on Tuesday night at a ceremony at the National Gallery in London by Financial Times editor Lionel Barber and Vivian Hunt , managing partner of our United Kingdom and Ireland office. Vivian describes The Man Who Knew as “marrying the biographer’s humanizing touch with a fascinating inside look at how policy decisions are actually reached in the real world.” Sebastian, a British journalist based in Washington DC, and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees the book’s significance this way: “Some people think that we had a financial crisis because of an intellectual error, that Greenspan didn’t understand that the finance was unstable. My book shows that he understood perfectly well, that finance was radically unstable and you can still have a crisis. So this book forces us to rethink why finance was unstable.” Also on Tuesday, Nora Rosendahl, Helsinki-based co-founder of wellness startup You-app, was presented this year’s Bracken Bower Prize, awarded to the best proposal for a business book by an author under 35. Nora won the £15,000 prize for her proposal Mental Meltdown, a book which examines what she sees as a ticking time bomb of work-stress related diseases, particularly for the millennial generation. She was motivated to write the proposal by the plight of her peers. “In my peers, I’ve seen so much exhaustion and so much stress and so much unnecessary anxiety with younger people in work life today –– and all of it is preventable. There are small things that employers and above all the individual can do to combat stress and exhaustion,” she explains. The Business Book of the Year Award, in its 12th edition, is given to the book that provides “the most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues, including management, finance, and economics.” Since 2005, it has selected books that comprise a thorough overview of business in a tumultuous decade. Each of this year's other shortlisted authors, presented below, will receive £10,000. Never miss a story"

December 9, 2016 What percentage of McKinsey consultants are migrants or the children of migrants? This question came up as the team behind our new report on global migration was putting the finishing touches on the analysis. Many of the consultants who work on the project team live outside the country of their birth. Just like the estimated 247 million migrants globally, their reasons for moving are incredibly varied and deeply personal. “My father is from Syria, my mother from the eastern part of Germany,” says Khaled Rifai, a McKinsey partner and one of the report’s coauthors. “They met at university, where my father studied on a scholarship. After my brother and I were born, we fled East Germany to Kuwait, where my father’s family lived. After spending most of my childhood in western Germany, we moved back to Kuwait for a second time in 1989, only to be forced out of the country shortly before the Iraqi invasion.” “When we returned to western Germany, the border had just opened, and we found ourselves in the midst of mass migration within the country. It wasn't easy to find accommodation: our whole family lived in a studio for over a year. We had only a handful of personal possessions, as we had left Kuwait on short notice. We weren’t exactly refugees, but I do remember growing up with the feeling that I did not really belong. My father often told us that we had to work harder, to ‘dig in’ more, just to keep up with our German peers.” Khaled, who now lives in New York City, was part of the McKinsey team that yesterday presented our research to the Council of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Geneva. He was joined by research team members Anu Madgavkar , Ravi Ram, and Jonathan Woetzel , himself a migrant from the United States to China. They also joined a roundtable discussion about the report’s findings with migrants who have been supported by the IOM. As the research makes clear, the recent wave of immigrants arriving in Europe from the Middle East and Africa is part of a much larger global phenomenon. More than 90 percent of the world’s cross-border migrants moved voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. According to research from the McKinsey Global Institute, migrants account for 3.4 percent of the world’s population but contributed 9.4 percent of global GDP. That said, the humanitarian challenge of forced migration is very real and urgent. Over the past 18 months, we’ve been working on the ground in the Middle East to help governments, aid agencies, and other stakeholders create economic opportunities and deliver education to refugees and refugee-host communities.

January 10, 2017 Medellín is one of the great urban turnaround stories. A city once synonymous with drug cartels and deadly violence has transformed itself into a thriving, innovative, and fast-growing metropolis. Since November, it is also home to our second office in Colombia, after Bogotà. Medellín’s revitalization rests partly on 20 years of public–private cooperation on issues such as transportation, bilingual education, and affordable housing. One example: a network of cable cars and a giant outdoor escalator that connect residents in marginalized mountainsides to schools and jobs in the valley. This type of civic innovation has drawn recognition internationally. Last year, Medellín won the biennial Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize , and Mayor Federico Gutiérrez Zuluaga in October accepted the Transformational City of the Year award at the annual BRAVO Business Awards. “Colombia and its cities have shown the world that they are resilient,” says McKinsey partner and Colombian native Jaime Morales , who leads our work in the country. “Having a permanent base in Medellín will help us contribute to the next wave of growth and also tap into the local talent pool.” Notable local universities include the School of Engineering of Antioquia and EAFIT University . The team based in Medellín will draw on additional support not only from Bogotà but also from experts across our global firm. They will focus on issues related to the region’s revitalization, such as operations, growth, and sustainability. Among those on the ground is Doug Nagy , who grew up in Cleveland and worked in urban development before joining McKinsey. It’s a background that gives him a special appreciation for the city: “What Medellín has achieved in terms of public safety is just astonishing. Like Cleveland, it’s often been seen as an underdog city, so it’s an incredible time to be here.” With a population of 2.5 million people, Medellín is actually larger than the Greater Cleveland area and boasts at least one other notable advantage: thanks to a year-round temperate climate, Medellín is known as “the city of eternal spring.” Never miss a story"

The artificial-intelligence (AI) aficionados who stopped for a chat were surprised to learn that McKinsey Analytics comprises more than 800 data scientists, data engineers, and analytics practitioners. When it comes to applying AI technologies such as deep learning to real-world problems, we’re at the forefront. McKinsey Analytics has a hand in about 10 percent of our client projects globally—a percentage that is rising steadily. In addition to growing organically, we’ve also made a small number of analytics-focused acquisitions, such as London-based QuantumBlack and Toronto-based PriceMetrix . As a McKinsey client, this means you’re increasingly likely to meet consultants steeped in the art of random-forest modeling and of recursive neural networks—people such as Hugh Skottowe, a particle physicist who contributed to the discovery of the Higgs boson ; Martha Imprialou, a computer scientist who joined QuantumBlack following postdoctoral research in genetics; or Luke Gerdes, formerly a professor at the United States Military Academy, who has an interest in using analytics to help counter terrorist networks and insurgents. Why the upsurge of interest in data analytics? Put simply, the availability of massive computing power combined with equally massive data sets (everything from digital photos to factory-performance data) now makes it possible to apply machine-learning techniques to a wide range of problems in business and government. Hugh works in our Ingenuity group, a McKinsey Solution, building analytics capabilities within insurance companies and using machine learning to predict underwriting risks. Martha’s work at QuantumBlack spans everything from analyzing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical sales to optimizing car-manufacturing processes. Luke works mainly with public-sector clients, for example using social-media data to understand sentiment. In many of our projects, client data is supplemented with data sourced from elsewhere to generate insights, says Hugh. The rub is that it can take weeks of painstaking work before the data is in a fit state for the analysis to begin. “There’s often a long up-front process of data collection, data cleaning, and data linking before the team can start to generate insights and impact for the client,” says Bill Wiseman, a senior partner based in Taipei. “Analytics is an incredibly exciting, powerful approach to solving problems, but it does require a degree of patience.” This is true not only for client executives hungry for answers but also for McKinsey colleagues steeped in our tradition of hypothesis-driven problem solving, in which strong hypotheses are put on the table early in a project before being tested and refined. “It was hard for me when I first started [at McKinsey] three years ago, since most people didn’t fully understand my role,” recalls Tiffany Kwok, an analytics expert based in our Tokyo office. “But once I got involved in my first project and was able to create a model that ended up generating significant revenue for a client, people began to pay attention.” It’s against this background that McKinsey Analytics recruiters and practitioners set out their stall at last week’s AI Frontiers conference in California. Back in London at QuantumBlack, Martha sees the results of the recruiting outreach: “Every week, we get a handful of new hires. It just keeps growing.” Learn more about career opportunities with McKinsey Analytics. Never miss a story"

McKinsey’s chief learning officer (CLO) oversees leadership development and skill building for our 25,000 people around the globe. He is also a visiting professor in corporate learning at both Nyenrode Business University, in the Netherlands, and the University of Pennsylvania. On top of that, Nick still finds time to lead e-Learning for Kids, a foundation he set up 12 years ago, in 2005. “When I was a kid, I always thought I wanted to be a teacher—to help others to learn and grow,” Nick explains. “After more than 30 years in the field, it still excites me just as much today as it did then.” And that’s no coincidence, according to Nick. “If you look at the research, there is a clear link between learning and leading a fulfilling life. Over the last 40 years, scientists have proved that previous assumptions that our capacity for learning diminishes as we age are not true. We now know that people can learn throughout their lives.” What interests Nick most are the approaches that organizations and individuals take to learning and development. “Companies are starting to invest in professional learning as a strategic priority. Many are also using the latest technology to enable learning,” he says. But it is individuals who will need to take responsibility for their own lifelong learning, he believes, in light of the disruptive effect that automation and other trends will have on the future of work. “Studies show that people who maintain their ability to learn outpace others professionally,” he says. Learning has always played a central role at McKinsey. Until the 1960s, consultants attended Saturday morning training sessions in our offices. Today a culture of learning is integral to who we are—we invest significantly in developing knowledge and building capabilities. Apprenticeship, our form of on-the-job learning, is a critical part of almost every colleague’s career development. “My professional career has been built around learning, but it has always struck me that more than 100 million children never have the chance to go to school,” he recalls. Early on, he encountered skepticism about whether children in developing countries could access online learning resources, but the Internet’s growth made that possible. Today, developers in India and project managers in the Netherlands help run a truly global and virtual organization. Never content to stand still, Nick wants to deliver a complete elementary-school curriculum, based on the International Baccalaureate standard, in different languages and across different technology platforms, including mobile and low-cost tablets. “Whenever I go on holiday, I try to connect with users of e-Learning for Kids,” Nick says. “When I was in South Africa recently, one school principal allowed me to take over a classroom for half a day! But what really hit me was when he explained how the teachers themselves were using the e-lessons to improve the quality of their teaching.” Never miss a story"

Given the tremendous success of “Best Countries” and McKinsey’s deep US-states expertise, why not collaborate, they thought, and do something similar for US states. “We wanted to better inform an area that’s not always talked about,” shared Aly Spencer, an associate partner who works in the State and Local government practice. “There’s a lot of data at the national level and on cities, and so we saw an opportunity to look at the state level.” As of today, U.S. News’s Best States platform is live, leveraging data collected and organized by McKinsey across seven categories: healthcare, education, infrastructure, crime and corrections, opportunity, economy, and government. All of this collectively makes up the Leading States Index. The weightings of each of the indices were based on McKinsey’s proprietary customer satisfaction survey that covered over 10,000 citizens in 22 states. The site includes U.S. News’s rankings and editorial content that offer a snapshot of states’ economic and social situations. It took a collaborative effort over the course of nine months to collect, analyze, and synthesize the data so that it was as comprehensive yet as concise as possible. “We worked with longtime sector experts across healthcare, education, and infrastructure; McKinsey Global Institute researchers; and analytics and research capabilities from our Knowledge Networks in Waltham and Costa Rica,” explained Ted Rounsaville, an associate partner in the State and Local government practice who concentrates on education and healthcare. “Each of the seven categories was reviewed in depth by people who have spent their entire careers focused on those respective areas.” What does “Leading States” mean for public sector institutions? “It’s the first comprehensive measurement of how citizens experience their states, so now government leaders can identify the most important opportunities to improve,” explained Aly.  Additionally, it’s a tool for citizens and other community leaders to understand their states and how they can work collectively to improve them. “We designed the Leading States Index with a strong citizen experience lens,” she added. “We used easily recognizable and broad measures that are relevant to all US citizens, like having access to high quality public education.” As for the rankings’ results, “there is no clear winner,” observed Ted. Every state showed successes as well as areas for improvement. Now that it’s up and running, the index can be tracked and will be updated next year with the latest data. Interested in learning more?

Among the 100,000 visitors who descended this week on Barcelona were sizeable contingents of executives from across the high tech, telecoms and internet sector. If you don’t mind crowds, this made it a great opportunity to listen, learn, and compare notes with the industry’s leading lights. This year about 100 McKinsey experts made the trip, and for the first time found a home base at a McKinsey booth. Venkat  Atluri , the global leader of our Internet of Things work, moderated two panels on the main stage. Our Growth Tech hosted a workshop for start-up founders, investors and corporate innovators. Other McKinsey people split their time between bi-lateral meetings and ad-hoc conversations on our exhibition stand. “Mobile World Congress is a pressure cooker of interactions and new ideas coming together,” explains Philipp Nattermann , a senior partner and global leader of our Telecom Practice. “Telecom leaders are concerned about the old model, but there are also huge opportunities with intelligent 5G networks and the Internet of Things transforming sectors like education, healthcare, manufacturing, travel and logistics. But these opportunities require new skills, and so we are here talking about the best way to approach this intersection of old model and new opportunities.” These themes were echoed by Peter Dahlstrom , a senior partner and a leader of Mckinsey Digital. “Most of my conversations centered around digital, not surprisingly,” says Peter, “but because the telecom sector is at a tipping point – mobile prices falling, customers using more data and services, and capital spending rising – there is more urgency now to really embed digital and analytics in organizations, as this is how they’ll do more with less.” On the topic of IoT, conversations turned to the need to build alliances and partnerships, says Venkat. “Going in we knew there was a lot of interest—even anxiety— on the new business models that are emerging in IoT– and people were asking a lot of questions about how to get the IoT data they need to create value. For example, telcos might partner with retailers or CPG companies to combine datasets. But how do you identify the right partners? How do you get started? How do you create value for consumers?” And over at Mobile World’s startup conference, 4YFN (Four Years From Now), our Growth Tech consultants hosted a workshop for 75 company founders, venture capital companies and corporate innovators. “Innovation was top of mind as large companies are realizing how difficult it is to sustain internal innovation “labs” and groups,” says Ken Fenyo, one of our Growth Tech experts. “There’s a sense that they need to act quickly to keep up with the disruptive innovations coming out of startups but that is much easier said than done. While many companies are turning to corporate venture capital to keep pace, there is no ‘right’ way to work with start ups. A range of approaches, including corporate investing, partnerships, joint ventures (and even M&A) can all play a role in helping larger companies innovate.” Same time, same place in 2018? “We heard a really positive reaction to our increased participation this year. Our expert group on the ground in our booth covered all of the topics people were asking about – IoT, design, analytics, digital, transformation – and as a result, we offered participants an integrated view on how mobile technology will affect their business,” noted Peter. “And of course, we were happy to have the opportunity to show off our growing capabilities in these areas, which not everyone knows about yet. So, yes, I am pretty sure we'll be back in 2018.” Never miss a story"
GoVolunteer platform matches volunteers with opportunities,"Last year we held our first Social Impact Awards, to recognize the many colleagues who are leaders of social impact at McKinsey.

March 9, 2017 Ask people at McKinsey what they love about our firm’s work, and most of them will probably say something about problem solving. Within our offices, colleagues often speak not about holding meetings but having a problem-solving session. Another thing that drives McKinsey people is impact: making a substantial, lasting difference to our clients’ performance. But for many, what excites them most is using their problem-solving and commitment to impact to tackle the world’s biggest problems: societal challenges from health to education, economic development to environmental issues. Last year we held our first Social Impact Awards, to celebrate and recognize the many colleagues who are leaders of social impact at McKinsey. A recent post featured Nick Van Dam, McKinsey’s Chief Learning Officer , a finalist for his e-Learning for Kids foundation. The entries were wide and varied, from marine mammal conservation in the United States to digital financial inclusion in rural Africa to education for disadvantaged children in Southeast Asia. One of the winning entries was GoVolunteer , a nonprofit founded by Malte Bedürftig, a consultant based in our Berlin office. More than a million refugees arrived in Germany in 2015, their plight inspiring many in the country to volunteer their time and skills to help those arriving and support better integration into society. “We started out in 2014 as a team of colleagues at McKinsey’s Berlin office who were volunteering together to provide practical support to refugee shelters,” says Malte, who found himself leading the group. “But the numbers snowballed as more and more people, from inside and outside of the firm, wanted to help, and we needed to find a new way to match offers from volunteers with needs of charities.” It was not only a problem inside our firm. “I heard stories of motivated volunteers with important skills who were being turned away by charities because they couldn’t make use of them,” he explains. So, in the summer of 2015, Malte and colleagues set out to find a solution that would maximize the impact of the thousands of people seeking the most effective ways to help. They turned to McKinsey Digital Labs (MDL) for design and technology expertise to help them develop an online platform that could match volunteers’ time and skills with the needs of social sector organizations. “The MDL team helped us get from concept to the first working version of our website in under 6 weeks,” explains Malte. “People who want to volunteer can visit the website and find opportunities which have been posted by nonprofits, based on their location, availability, and skills.” The nonprofit they founded, GoVolunteer, manages the website and supports the volunteers and nonprofits. The team runs networking and social events for volunteers to build community and skills training on topics like communication, mentoring, and leadership. They also provide one-on-one coaching to the nonprofits to help them get the best from their volunteers and to develop their organizations. GoVolunteer scaled rapidly, which Malte attributes to the need for volunteers and the readiness within society to come forward to help. It has already enabled over 30,000 volunteers to support more than 1,000 nonprofits and is currently active in Austria,  Germany, and Switzerland. The team has high ambitions, with plans to expand coverage beyond Germany into countries, including Greece, Italy, and Turkey, where refugees continue to arrive. “Volunteering is important,” Malte believes, “because when people come and work together, it builds a stronger society. GoVolunteer is about spreading a volunteer culture so that volunteering becomes a normal part of everyday life. Thirty percent of volunteers using the platform arrived in Germany as refugees themselves.” Never miss a story"

April 12, 2017 Deep in the Canadian Rockies, in a ski lodge, about two dozen executives from a fast-growing logistics company debrief what happened less than an hour earlier in the sunlit glade outside. Knee-deep in snow, they had all participated in an avalanche rescue simulation. Using shovels, probes, and radio transmitters, they had worked against the clock to find objects buried in the snow, as rescuers would look for people in a real-life disaster. The executives take turns candidly describing the strengths and weaknesses the simulation exposed. Resources were misallocated. Communication broke down. “We all want to be heroes,” says one of them. The program, McKinsey’s fourth adventure session for the group, was part of an ongoing leadership development journey. The client has ambitious growth targets, and the intense and accelerated program aims to make deep shifts in mindsets and transform a culture of hierarchy and siloes into one that prizes leadership agility, teamwork and feedback. The change is tangible within weeks. Adventure-based learning experiences are one of the ways we work with our clients to help them build leadership capabilities. Through McKinsey Academy , we also offer CEO forums, one-on-one coaching journeys and group-based leadership development. “Adventure learning can be a powerful way to help people build new habits, mindsets, and actions,” says Johanne Lavoie , a McKinsey partner who leads the program and has made these mountains her home for the past ten years. “The outdoors experiences can be a horseback trek to understand your own limits and build resilience; a night alone, with limited supplies, to face your fears and reflect on questions we rarely take time for; a canoe expedition to collaborate in a fast-changing environment, or a ski-touring expedition to develop system thinking– a way of seeing the connections and interactions of a whole,” she explains. “When you go out there in the back country with nature and wildlife, it’s very direct, because your anxieties and fears are triggered every moment. At the same time, you are tapping into deeper purpose and meaning. Nature has a way of helping us let go of our need to be right and find new answers.” “I feel totally invigorated and completely inspired,” said one client executive after the program. “Most importantly, I have a much clearer sense of the path forward and what I need to do to be the person and leader that I want to be.”  Another participant observed, “I changed how I perceived myself and my environment, and engage in a fundamentally different way.” Johanne believes leadership development is critical in an environment of increasing complexity and uncertainty. “When we face disruptive change, we tend to rely on expertise, best practice from the past, and habits. It gives us this false sense of control,” she explains, “But in more uncertain times, we need to take more time to listen deeply, ask different questions, look for patterns and use team collaboration to foster diverse perspectives. This approach is not easy for most of us who have been trained and rewarded to find the right answer, but it is at the heart of leadership agility in complex times.” Within McKinsey, Johanne pioneered the leadership master program to help her own colleagues develop their capacity to become more agile in the way they work with clients. “We use techniques like meditation, movement, journaling, storytelling and creative expression. We explore developmental psychology using our own life narratives and help people develop personal commitments and practices to sustain their growth,” she says. “The goal is to help people achieve a fuller expression of their leadership potential and inner agility and lead life-affirming change in the world through our client work. To take this work to our clients, we need to start with ourselves.” Johanne’s approach to leadership development has been shaped by her own experience,

The future of manufacturing, that is. This center, one of five digital model  factories, will serve as a showcase and teaching ground for the emerging technologies of “Industry 4.0.”—advancements in data and analytics, robotics and automation, and production methods such 3-D and 4-D printing. Each of these advancements plays a critical role in reshaping manufacturing and operations, and helping companies achieve significant—even sensational—improvements in productivity. For example, Oliver Tonby , managing partner of Southeast Asia, points out that “automation and real-time dispatching in a semiconductor business can ramp up production by up to 50 percent.” In our recent survey , 90 percent of manufacturers agree that Industry 4.0 technologies will change their operations—yet less than half think they are ready, with the strategy, people, data, or processes in place. To help companies prepare for this sea change, we designed five learning environments to make “the digital as tangible as possible,” explains Jörg Bromberger, the senior practice manager who has led the initiative over the past two years. In addition to Singapore, the new centers will be located in Aachen (Germany), Beijing, Chicago, and Venice (Italy). Like our existing network of capability centers , each digital center is completely different with a production line tailored to the local client base; for example, “smart” radio-frequency-identification (RFID) wristbands in Germany and iced-tea processing in China. “But they will all share the same 25 digital learning modules—so the person in Venice will have the same learning experience as the participant in Chicago,” says Jörg.  “We’ve taken a full production line in each setting and layered it with digital technology - so users can experience the possibilities at every touchpoint.” Each center is connected with a leading industry consortium, government organization, or research institution that serves as the scientific backbone. The centers will be dynamic, updating and adding new technologies on a regular basis—such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and cobots and robots later this year. The Singapore DCC recreates the environment of a manufacturer of industrial gearboxes.  The fictional $2 billion company has 8,000 employees spread across five key geographies. During workshops, participants watch as plant workers use digital technologies to manage scenarios, such as a pending equipment failure or a spike in demand that threatens to overwhelm the supply chain. As the set of actions unfold, “participants can see the digital thread of communications flashing across the screens, from war-room planning of raw materials all the way to customer service, as the company responds to these situations,” says Alpesh Patel, who leads the Singapore center. The scenarios are drawn from the direct experience of 40-plus aerospace and manufacturing companies who participate in the public-private collaboration behind the center. In Aachen , the manufacturing line of RFID wristbands is set up to show a “before” and “after” state. Participants start the program observing a fully operating lean-production facility. “Throughout the workshop, they can ‘turbo charge’ the line with a set of digital tools that penetrate—and provide visibility and analytics—into every step of the process,” explains Jörg. “For example, by applying digital condition monitoring, which provides information every few seconds—rather than a once a day—they can reduce equipment downtime by as much as 75 percent.” The workshops are open to large and small companies and are tailored to the participants’ experience, ranging from an introduction to Industry 4.0 capabilities to running an actual technology pilot to skills building for a large-scale implementation.

Pictured, pianist Rob Robertson entertains troops in France in 1944. April 18, 2017 We’re excited to announce the winner of the HBR McKinsey Award for the best Harvard Business Review article of the year: “ Why diversity programs fail ,” by sociology professors Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev . Corporate diversity—and lack thereof—has made headlines this year. The ultimate finding of Frank and Sandra’s work has been that, for decades, workplace programs designed to foster diversity have been ineffective. The authors, who are based in the United States and Israel, respectively, also pinpoint the interventions that have shown the most promise in bringing about long-term change. We sat down with the authors to learn more: Why is workplace diversity important to you? Frank: I think it’s important for reasons of social justice, generally. My parents were active in the civil rights movement when I was growing up. We lived in the South for a while, so when I was very little, I got dragged to demonstrations pretty often. It’s interesting to look at the world now – how much it has changed on some dimensions, and how little on others. It’s been something that has always interested me and frustrated me. Sandra: I believe that businesses have the capacity to transform the wider society. In the case of diversity, when previously excluded groups get to keep good jobs, they earn more income and can support their families and communities. Moreover, in light of endemic residential and school segregation, the workplace is in many respects the main place where different groups in society interact. So if there is diversity in the workplace, it can normalize diversity in society. On a personal level, I grew up in a predominantly non-white town where I, as a white girl, was on the receiving end of a lot of reverse discrimination and harassment. It made me aware of what it feels like to be a member of a minority group and sparked a lifelong interest in trying to make society a better place for minorities. Would you say that the issue of workplace diversity has gained in prominence over the years? Frank: Sandra and I started publishing things about 10 years ago from this line of research, shortly before the economic crisis. In the business world in general, there has been a waxing and waning of interest in the issues of equality of opportunity and diversity. After the crisis, firms lost interest in the issue for a while.  It seems that we go through phases of intense interest. We are in one of those phases now: a lot of tech companies are trying new things, a lot of finance companies are trying new things; so a lot of the most visible firms show renewed commitment. Why has it taken so long for people to see that these programs weren’t effective? Sandra: For a long time, there was no research. Companies put programs in place in the belief that that was the solution. Either they really believed in the program, or they didn’t really care about the outcomes; they just wanted to show they had a program in place. In the 1970s and the ’80s, just changing structures and putting new efforts in place was already a huge improvement from the period before the civil rights movement. People didn’t even think about whether the innovations actually worked. There’s been more research in the last 20 years, but it’s mainly focused on short-term effects. Much of that research is problematic, because it’s not rigorous or long-term enough to actually pinpoint effective programs. It’s noteworthy how people created these original diversity programs to get rid of bias, but in the end the best intentions were ultimately undermined by even deeper biases.  We seem to think we can out-engineer our own psychology, but it does us in. Is that an overly pessimistic takeaway? Frank: The good news is that in the last 40 years, the level of explicit in-your-face discrimination and bias in the economy and in employment has gone down dramatically. When people are asked on questionnaires about groups that they hold animosity toward, the results are much less troubling than they used to be. What hasn’t changed is the subconscious stereotypes that people hold. And the bad news is we think we can train people to be less biased, but we haven’t seen much evidence of that. Sandra: I think this is exactly why diversity training doesn’t work. Even the best type of diversity training, where participation is voluntary and the focus is on culture and the business case, has a relatively small effect on underlying prejudice. Diversity training is a one-time commitment. In the best training programs, trainers talk about unconscious bias, cultural differences, and the business case for diversity. It’s an in-and-out, off-the-shelf kind of solution. What works better is a diversity committee or task force, made up of people from the organization from different departments and different ranks. They come together, examine their own department or function or team, and learn of specific barriers to diversity.  Then they develop tailored solutions, follow the implementation and, ideally, report on progress. It’s a sustained effort. You cite a study from World War II where integrated forces were shown to have improved relationships. Frank: People’s stereotypes go away as they get to know people from other groups, especially if they work side by side with them. If you are white and have not been exposed to African-Americans very much, we know from that natural experiment during World War II and subsequent studies that intense exposure through working side by side helps you to individualize people from a group that you are not familiar with and stop stereotyping them. So if you want to change stereotyping at work, the best way to do it is not to try to train it away, but to expose people to people from other groups in their work lives. In effect, you have to start by integrating the workplace. That’s what’s going to diminish stereotypes. If you could have magical powers and institute any program that you wanted for the largest companies in America and even small ones, what would you have them do? Sandra: Diversity committees. Having a VP for diversity and diversity committees throughout the organization, that report to the CEO every six months—I think this is the mother of all programs. Frank: One of the most effective solutions for promoting women and minorities into management is formal mentoring programs. The key is that they connect people who didn’t know each other before, who are from different departments and a couple of levels in the hierarchy apart.  Mentoring programs work, we believe, because they connect minority men and women, and white women, with white-men mentors, because in most companies, the people further up the chain of command are more likely to be white men. How optimistic are you of things improving? What is your definition of success? Frank: My metric is: How much change has there been in actual workforce diversity? How much do the numbers move, particularly in management, professional, technical jobs—the jobs at the top? We’ve seen a period of stagnation and I’m optimistic but only because I feel like there is this new enthusiasm at all kinds of companies to actually try to do something now. More and more companies are taking an evidence-based view of this: “Let’s find out what actually works. Let’s not do the same thing we’ve done before, but with a few tweaks, and see if it works this time. Let’s try to consider what the social science says, let's try to find companies that have succeeded.” Why do you think sociology and anthropology are the right disciplines to look at these issues? What do they bring to this research that other disciplines can’t? Sandra: Most diversity consultants have a background in psychology. Maybe it’s because the flipside of diversity is discrimination and inequality and yes, stereotypes and biases have psychological components. There is this belief that if we just put people in a room and train away their stereotypes, everything will be good, but stereotypes and biases are sociological as well as psychological phenomena. They are dependent on context. Organizations are complex social, cultural, political, and economic systems. Looking at the problem only from the psychological angle misses a lot of the sources of inequality and a lot of the dynamics and processes that stand in the way of solving the problem of inequality. What’s next on the horizon? Frank: One of the main things we are working on now is a longitudinal study of how changes in diversity lead to changes in corporate performance. Most studies so far have been cross-sectional, showing that more diverse companies have better profitability or share-price performance. Very successful companies tend to be expanding quickly, and if you expand right now, it’s easier to hire more African-American managers than it was 40 years ago because there are more African-American MBAs today, for instance.  So those snapshots of diversity and performance at one point in time don’t tell us much. It can be hard to figure out cause versus effect. We have very cool data on all publicly traded companies since 1971 and have been working for a while with some doctoral students on merging this data. In fact, we have a phone call in half an hour with the programmers to talk about how this is going. That’s one of the things I’m most excited about.

"A revolutionary tool for cutting emissions, ten years on","This Earth Day, we&rsquo;re marking ten years of our greenhouse-gas cost curve, a decision-making tool that changed how experts approach the carbon-emissions debate.",2017-04-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Sustainability",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-revolutionary-tool-for-cutting-emissions-ten-years-on,"A revolutionary tool for cutting emissions, ten years on A selection of some of the GHG-abatement measures featured in the cost curve. From left to right: organic soils restoration; onshore wind power—high penetration; reforestation of degraded forest; solar photovoltaics; offshore wind; intensive agriculture (leading to decreased deforestation); second-generation lignocellulosic biofuels; biomass materials (biomass co-firing in coal power plant.) April 21, 2017 This Earth Day, we’re marking ten years of our greenhouse-gas cost curve, a decision-making tool that changed how experts approach the carbon-emissions debate. In 2007, leaders the world over were seeking ways to meet their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Kyoto Protocol .  What were the most efficient, cost-effective ways to get greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere? McKinsey sought to answer that question with our greenhouse-gas (GHG) cost curve . Ten years on, our cost curves have helped countries and businesses create strategies to address climate change. By presenting the relative cost-benefit of each option, the curve opens the way to a more dispassionate, fact-based conversation about what to do. Behind the curve is research and data on each of the different options for reducing emissions.  These range from investing in solar panels to grasslands management to electric vehicles to windfarms. Research for  the cost curve began as a study conducted for a Swedish utility company but quickly grew into something more. As the report circulated, “in three months, McKinsey very suddenly became the thought leader on climate economics,” says Tomas Nauclér , a senior partner based in Stockholm. The cost curve methodology was used in Germany that very same year, and then, in short succession, in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia. Since then, McKinsey went on to produce abatement studies for China, India, Brazil, Russia, and Sweden, among others. In 2009, one of the most important audiences for the GHG cost curve was the governmental ministers and experts involved in the run-up to the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15), the annual flagship United Nations summit on climate change. There was no uniform set of data that could inform climate-change discussions. Environmentalists, corporate executives, academics, campaigners, and policy makers were often talking at cross-purposes and the cost curves gave them a shared vocabulary—on a single page. Matt Rogers, a senior partner based in San Francisco and leader of the Sustainability  and Resource Productivity (SRP)  Practice , explains, “In an environment where many people were making bold assertions about what needed to be done, the firm, true to its roots, was the first to put economic unit costs against abatement measures.” This gave structure to policy debates and led to a more practical set of recommendations on how to address climate change. Beyond the political realm, business leaders also were searching for the way forward on climate change. Shannon Bouton, COO of the McKinsey Center for Business and the Environment , has seen the cost curve embraced by many organizations: “Companies use it to galvanize emissions-reduction efforts within their industry, and to prioritize efforts within their own operations.” And Nicolas  Denis , a partner in our Brussels office who focuses on advising governments on sustainable economic development, recalls, “Companies could see on this ‘map’ how they could contribute to the debate.” The GHG-abatement curve soon became a calling card for the SRP Practice. Matt was sought out by the US Department of Energy, where the cost curve changed the debate to a focus on economic priorities and data-driven decisions. He went on to serve as a senior adviser to Secretary Chu from 2009 to 2010, overseeing the Department of Energy’s funding of more than 5,000 innovation projects in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon capture and sequestration, among other responsibilities. Nicolas particularly remembers the excitement at COP 15, as attendees mentioned how the cost curve had transformed the debate. “I remember one of them saying at the end of this conference, ‘There will be a before and after the cost curve in the COP.’” Besides being a game-changing framework for carbon abatement, the cost curve also reveals important realities frequently ignored in climate-change debates. Nicolas stresses, “It was the first time we showed that it is possible to combine economic growth with GHG-emissions reductions.” It also confirmed that there is “enough technology to go a long way into decarbonization without needing complex carbon-capture approaches.” And Tomas stresses that “land use and forestry are a huge part of the ‘problem’ but also play a central role in the solution.” He adds, “Curbing climate change can be done and will only cost 1 to 2 percent of global GDP, but it requires a comprehensive set of actions across all sectors.” The first curve from ten years ago wasn’t perfect. It vastly underestimated how quickly technology costs would fall for renewable-energy sources like batteries, LED lighting, wind turbines, and solar photovoltaic panels. Meanwhile, it posited that carbon capture and sequestration (ways of taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it somewhere else) would make more progress. And, as Matt explains, “we totally missed the revolution in unconventional gas, which has been one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse-gas reduction globally. We were not alone, but it goes to show how hard it is to forecast technologies.” Tomas adds, “Had we redone it today, we would also have included the benefits of optimizing end-to-end value chains, like improving transportation use, reducing waste in retail, and the benefits of the sharing economy.” Ten years on, the cost curve framework still plays an integral role in our work for national governments, cities, and companies. Emissions are still high, and creating binding reduction targets is a challenge further complicated by politics. But there is much hope for the future. So onward to the next ten years!

A new focus on productivity for the McKinsey Center for Government,"This weekend, thousands of government officials, economic experts, and policy makers from all across the world gathered in Washington DC for the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.",2017-04-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Government,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-new-focus-on-productivity-for-the-mckinsey-center-for-government,"A new focus on productivity for the McKinsey Center for Government From left to right at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington DC: moderator Raj Kumar, editor-in-chief of Devex ; William Morneau, minister of finance of Canada; Bjarne Corydon, director of McKinsey Center for Government and former minister of finance of Denmark; Elaine Kamarck, founding director of Center for Effective Public Management, Brookings Institution ; Luis Alberto Moreno, president of Inter-American Development Bank ; Jim Brumby, director of Public Service and Performance of The World Bank. April 24, 2017 This weekend, thousands of government officials, economic experts, and policy makers from all across the world gathered in Washington DC for the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . Economic development, effective aid, security, and innovation were on the agenda. As part of the event, we hosted a panel discussion with participants representing Denmark, Canada, the US, Latin America, and developing nations to introduce our new report Government productivity: Unlocking the $3.5 trillion opportunity . Government delivery as a topic has gained significant traction in recent years. “As citizens have grown accustomed to the private sector’s rapid pace of innovation, they expect similar efficiencies and types of service experiences from the public sector. Governments are struggling to keep up,” explains Andrea Berchowitz , an associate partner in the Public Sector Practice and codirector of the report. Having worked extensively in economic development in South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya, Andrea brought a unique emerging-markets perspective to the development of the research. “The private sector benefits from two important aspects that the public sector does not—the diffusion of best practices by multinational corporations and the forces of competition,” says Richard Dobbs, senior partner at the McKinsey Center for Government . “As such, there has been no easy mechanism for governments to see what great—or not so great—looks like.” Prior to his role within the Center for Government, Richard led the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) for 7 years—McKinsey’s business and economics research arm, which has focused on productivity as a topic since the early 1990s. “I spent years studying long-term growth and became increasingly worried about how governments can keep up with growing citizen demands,” adds Richard. Given this need for greater transparency across countries, the McKinsey Center for Government—a hub for research and collaboration within the Public Sector Practice—has been relaunched, with a new focus on government productivity. “It’s time to raise government productivity on the agenda, as we see governments struggling more to work against social trends like an aging population and economic inequality,” adds Richard. “They face big challenges, and part of that is due to their tenuous fiscal position.” “We felt that we could leverage a lot of our existing knowledge and studies with governments and sectors from all across the world—with a lens on productivity,” recalls Tera Allas , a visiting fellow at MGI, former chief economist in a number of UK government departments, and former associate partner in the McKinsey London office. Research began in 2016, with a cross-sector and cross-geography team of Tera, Andrea, and Bjarne Corydon, director for the McKinsey Center for Government and former minister of finance of Denmark. Bjarne spent nearly 2 decades developing programs to digitize government processes to enhance services, save money, and improve citizens’ quality of life. “You really need the right technical tools in place to see successful reform happen,” says Bjarne. “That’s something the Center for Government is focused on—using technology and digitization, like analytics, to help governments adopt best practices.” The objective of the report is to inform governments on country-level productivity and show them how to do more with less. It makes use of a benchmarking tool that looks at 42 countries across tax collection, public safety, transport, education, and healthcare to understand what outcomes (for example, healthy life-expectancy and safe streets) governments get for their expenditure and how they compare to peer countries. It also includes best-in-class examples, such as Denmark increasing its healthy life expectancy by a year and a half while keeping spending per person flat, or the United Kingdom saving $300 million in a year from digitizing 25 basic services, such as voter and motor-vehicle registrations. The methodology for finding all these case studies? “Tons of primary interviews,” shares Andrea. “We spoke to everyone—public-sector consultants within the firm and current and former civil servants outside the firm. We spoke to mayors, ministers, digital officers, and a range of other people willing to share with us. We wanted to understand how more capabilities like digitization and attracting top talent can be brought into the public sector the way they are in the private sector and how to achieve greater ‘bang for the buck.’” The team also spent months hunting down granular, comparable, and reliable data on government expenditure and outcomes, such as healthy life expectancy, student test scores, teaching quality in universities, the public’s confidence in local police, and road quality. This data have been incorporated into a proprietary Tableau tool that will also be available to consultants and clients, offering a customized view into a country’s productivity to see how it stacks up against other peer countries. “We plan to use this with senior ministers or other government officials as a conversation opener to understand where their gaps lie,” shares Tera. “The goal is to point them to the right questions, and then we can work together to incorporate best practices.” Never miss a story"
Leadership development for all: McKinsey Academy offers online demo of Business Strategy course,"Last month, McKinsey Academy launched a free public trial of its Business Strategy online course—and in less than two weeks, more than 10,000 people signed up.",2017-05-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Capability Building,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/leadership-development-for-all-mckinsey-academy-offers-online-demo-of-business-strategy-course,"Leadership development for all: McKinsey Academy offers online demo of Business Strategy course May 3, 2017 Last month, McKinsey Academy launched a free public trial of its Business Strategy online course—and in less than two weeks, more than 10,000 people signed up. Why a demo ? “Our courses are relevant for a range of businesses, even those who might think they are too small, too early in their growth cycle, or have never heard of us,” explains Naveed Rashid who leads Digital Programs for the Academy. “Organizations can use our courses in many ways—whether it’s part of a full leadership and management program, an onboarding program, or to develop a specific set of skills,” he adds.  In the Business Strategy course, participants learn from strategy experts, CEOs, and leaders of governments and not for profits, as well as from McKinsey’s latest insights and examples across industries and geographies. How do we know the program is effective? “When people complete the full version of the course, we see a 40 to 45 percent jump in how they rate themselves before versus after the course,” says Naveed. “This includes their ability to ask meaningful questions to test the soundness of a strategy or how easily they can recognize and remove biases from strategic choices.” The demo course includes approximately one-third of the full course curriculum—about 10 hours’ worth of content—videos, case studies, interactive exercises,  and assessments. It introduces participants to the same strategic thinking and problem-solving approaches that we teach our own clients and consultants today. McKinsey Academy began as a start-up within the firm in 2013, under the guidance of senior partner André Dua .  A team of five converted a 100-page PowerPoint deck into a digital platform for client learning. “Open-source platforms such as edX were just starting up, and we began to look for ways to offer capability building to a much broader audience,” recalls Marc Metakis , COO, who has been with the Academy from the start. Four years, 40-plus staff members, and more than 20,000 course participants later, McKinsey Academy stands as our global hub for leadership development, with a mix of online and in-person programs for all levels, from next-generation managers to CEOs. What has spurred this growth?  “More and more, we see companies tying their value to talent—and increasingly investing in developing their people,” says Marc. “It’s less a question of whether their people can carry out the functions of their roles and more about whether they are equipped to become the leaders of tomorrow.  They know McKinsey is familiar with their business context and knows how to develop leaders, so it’s a natural progression to put their people in our hands for training.” To ensure that people’s potential is fully realized, McKinsey Academy is continuously refining its offerings—like adding a dozen new courses every year to its roster, offering foreign translations of its content (currently in Spanish and Portuguese, with plans for Thai and Arabic next), and expanding its reach through partnerships with external leadership organizations. Much of this growth is driven by the Academy team working closely with consultants and participants to understand what is and is not working. “For example, we know that 1.5 to 2.0 hours per week is the sweet spot for participants,” explains Marc. “We’ve applied adult learning principles so that our programs are realistic enough to fit into people’s busy work schedules, yet interactive and social enough to keep them engaged.” Regardless of clients’ sector, geography, or size, a common theme exists in what they are each looking for—a more holistic approach to leadership learning. If you want to develop your inner leader and hone your strategy skills, there’s still time. The demo registration will be open until May 15th. Check it out here. Never miss a story"
Our newest solution brings  ‘City Voices’ into government decision making,"Ask a young mother about how she likes living in her city and she’ll talk about the quality of the schools, the parks, and the grocery stores.",2017-05-11T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Solutions,AI & Analytics,Government",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-newest-solution-brings-city-voices-into-government-decision-making,"Our newest solution brings  ‘City Voices’ into government decision making May 11, 2017 Ask a young mother about how she likes living in her city and she’ll talk about the quality of the schools, the parks, and the grocery stores. A small-business owner will focus on parking for suppliers, the pool of qualified applicants for sales help, and managing paperwork online. A vacationing family will want affordable hotels, easy-to-use transportation, and unique sightseeing. With such diverse, competing needs across different populations, how can city managers make the best use of already stretched resources? City Voices , our newest solution , captures and analyzes citizen sentiment across key aspects of city life to help leaders understand what matters most to their constituents. It gathers feedback, at a very local level, across a variety of demographic groups as they experience some 30-plus interactions with their cities—for example, a neighborhood bus service. The idea for City Voices evolved a couple of years ago, during a series of McKinsey urban-planning projects in Brazil .  Fabiano Tiba, an engagement manager, was leading a city planning initiative in a southern metropolis. “At the time, social media technologies and the use of analytics were just emerging, and we used a pretty simple platform so that citizens could crowdsource ideas and vote on them. We could hear from and understand their hopes and frustrations directly, on a very granular basis,” he remembers. Soon afterward, Fabiano was helping to develop a strategic plan for a major metropolitan area. “What usually happens is that strategic plans are developed around the traditional government organizations—health, education, housing. But in this case, it immediately became clear, from the citizen feedback, that cleaning up a nearby river was top of mind for the public. This wasn’t even the government’s responsibility, but with such strong citizen demand, the mayor’s office defined a role in restoring the river use,” he recalls. “Similarly, there was a very strong mandate for a comprehensive youth-development program.” Because citizen input proved so valuable in planning across these cities, he said, they looked for ways to refine the very basic platform into a solution that could have broader use. A small team began to lay the groundwork. The greatest challenge was understanding the varying quality and types of citizen-related and other data sources available across cities and making sure these sources were relevant, granular enough to use, and translatable across different geographies. The solution got a jump start in 2016, when it won McKinsey’s New Ventures competition, created to surface and develop innovations within the firm. The prize included a team, resources from McKinsey Digital Labs , and the mentorship of McKinsey partner Patricia Ellen, who was based in Rio. Drawing from her experience in consumer products, she encouraged the team to think about citizens the same way a business views its customers and to apply the firm’s customer-journey framework . That way, the team could segment populations, identify and prioritize needs across groups, and organize the many types of data. “We conducted extensive interviews and field research, ultimately identifying six key demographic groups among city dwellers, such as student, tourist, and senior citizen,” explains Katarzyna Dudycz, a McKinsey urban-planning specialist. “We looked at the most common ways in which they experienced the city on a daily, monthly, and long-term basis, and identified key touchpoints in which they experienced city services that were frustrating or gratifying. We called these ‘moments of truth’ and used the touchpoints for gathering data—for example, a daily commute, access to good schools, feeling safe in the neighborhood, finding an affordable home.” The performance data from such moments of truth are drawn from a variety of local, national, and global sources, such as high-school graduation rates, help-desk records, and murder rates. These data are combined with citizen-perception data gathered through surveys, social-media analysis, and crowdsourcing databases. “With very defined, repeatable citizen experiences, we had a framework which could be applied across any city and enough data to populate an index, so a city could measure itself as well as compare how it was doing against its peers,” she explains. The solution includes data from 100 cities. “City Voices offers one more way our public-sector specialists can help clients develop initiatives that more closely address their constituents’ needs,” says Raman Julka, who helped with the early stages of developing the solution. “In some ways, cities are becoming the most important form of government we experience today, because of the effect they have on our everyday lives,” points out Isabel Adler, who is now managing the delivery of the solution. “Running our cities well, with guidance from our citizens’ voices, can be the key to improving the quality of life anywhere in the world.” Never miss a story"
Joining forces with United Way to tackle youth unemployment,"Generation, the youth employment program founded by McKinsey Social Initiative is partnering with United Way, the world’s largest privately funded nonprofit, to help even more young people find jobs and build careers.",2017-05-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Generation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/joining-forces-with-united-way-to-tackle-youth-unemployment,"Joining forces with United Way to tackle youth unemployment May 18, 2017 In late 2014, Jessica was working full-time at a day-care center in Pittsburgh and making minimum wage. Her hours were long and, as a single parent, childcare was tricky. “I never got off on time,” she recalls, “So the kids were often with me. We would be walking downtown at night at 10pm, and they’d be so tired.” Jessica had hoped to enter the healthcare field for quite some time, so when she heard about Generation’s certified nursing assistant (CNA) program, she eagerly applied. Less than a month after graduating from the 8-week program, she was hired by a local hospital. Looking back, Jessica thinks her time in Generation was transformative. “My teacher went above and beyond teaching us the knowledge we need, but she also taught me life skills.” Today, Jessica is one of over 10,000 young women and men across five countries who have graduated from Generation, a program founded by McKinsey Social Initiative . Behind it lies our Education to Employment research, which found that while 73 million young people were out of work, 40 percent of employers could not find employees with the skills they needed. “We’ve built and tested a new approach, which works in partnership with employers to place young people in jobs, through short, intensive boot camps, which address mind-sets and behaviors alongside technical skills, with mentorship, community, and social-support services,” explains Mona Mourshed , a senior partner at McKinsey who leads Generation. “By measuring data, we’ve shown that their incomes increase two to six times and that 88 percent of employers say Generation graduates outperform their peers. We’ve also shown that we can do this at a cost which is 50 to 80 percent less than similar programs in each country.” Today, Generation operates in more than 100 global locations, across 47 cities, and in 15 different professions, including digital marketing, insurance sales, healthcare assistant, and retail-cashier roles. In a little over 2 years, it has become the world’s largest youth-employment program of its kind, which both trains young people and places them in jobs. “From the beginning, one of our ambitions has always been to build something that is scalable, which can make a meaningful reduction in global levels of youth unemployment,” says Mona. “That’s why I’m excited about our new partnership with United Way , an organization with a distinguished, long history of building stronger communities across the world.” “United Way brings deep knowledge of local education and employment landscapes in the communities where they work, as well as fundraising capabilities and relationships with local employers. Generation offers a proven new approach, curriculum, quality assurance, and impact measurement. In combination, we think this will be a powerful partnership.” United Way is the world’s largest privately funded nonprofit. It works to better education, incomes, and health across more than 40 countries. “We’ve been fighting to create opportunities for young people in communities for 130 years,” said Brian Gallagher, United Way Worldwide president and CEO. “Right now, people are focused on getting good jobs, making ends meet, and moving up the economic ladder. Generation offers an exciting new way for us to build on our existing work, extend the program to new cities around the world, and help thousands more young people find jobs and careers.” For Jessica, balancing work and family life is still a challenge: she works 12-hour shifts and needs to carefully watch her finances to manage expenses. However, after only 6 months working as a CNA, she believes her financial future is brighter than before. “I’m not living paycheck to paycheck anymore,” she says. “I can do more things now with my children than I could before, and we’ve done some fun activities together as a family. Also, this is my first job with paid vacation. I hadn’t even been working at the hospital for a year but I got 15 paid days off, so we took a vacation.” Never miss a story"

As they develop, they could help to address global  food security challenges. May 30, 2017 Less than three months after being elected a partner of the firm, Yuito Yamada , who is based in our Tokyo office, was also awarded a fellowship to the Trilateral Commission . The nongovernmental organization promotes greater cooperation between North America, Europe, and the Asia–Pacific region and explores international solutions to pressing global concerns. Its members include leaders from industry, government, and society. Yuito’s fellowship will allow him to work closely with the commission’s 390 members, who currently include two other firm members: managing partner Dominic Barton and senior partner Vivian Hunt. Yuito was chosen for his expertise in food security. “When the commission invited me to interview, I was daunted,” he remembers. “But I described my work with clients on agriculture and talked about how I would like to improve the efficiency of food production to create a stable supply of food in our world.” Three weeks after the interview, Yuito was attending his first meeting of the commission in Washington, DC. Newspapers were still running tributes to the man for whom Yuito’s fellowship was named: David Rockefeller, who had died five days earlier at the age of 101. Rockefeller had described the organization he cofounded as “a group of private citizens with an intense interest in global affairs” who seek to “put their minds to the larger issues and call upon a diversity of expert opinions.” Yuito’s experience includes helping governments with agriculture and food security and private companies in Asia export technologies to increase food production. He and colleagues Nicolas Denis , Jakob Fischer, Lutz Goedde, and Masaaki Tanaka published a report last year on the opportunities for strengthening Japan’s agriculture . “In Japan, agriculture is very fragmented,” he explains, “with small farms accounting for a large share of production, a rapidly aging workforce in which the average age is 67.5, and domestic consumption set to decrease. This poses unique challenges.” “Globally, climate change will produce ‘winners,’ who will see an increase in agricultural productivity, as well as countries that will experience unprecedented difficulties,” he says. “For instance, between 2005 and 2009, the world saw food prices more than double as global economic trends—including the high price of oil, which led farmers to produce crops for biofuel—put pressure on food supplies.” “The limitations of geography mean that food shortages could be solved not by opening new production areas and farms but from making productivity improvements,” remarks Yuito. In the regional session of the Trilateral Commission in Tokyo later this year, Yuito will share new research on the potential implications of digital technologies for agriculture. “We are already seeing examples of automation, like the use of robots for growing, monitoring and harvesting crops, and analytics, such as the use of big data to optimize inputs of seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation to maximize yields. There has been more than $1 billion of start-up funding for the sector,” says Yuito. “But we believe the economic impact could be in excess of $300 billion, as these technologies mature and are adopted more widely. It’s an exciting time for agriculture—and holds great promise for feeding the world in the future.” Never miss a story"
Three business books to start your summer,"This summer marks the release of three new books from McKinsey authors, covering topics for leaders today across digital reinvention, timeless insights on organization, and doing business in China.",2017-06-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Publishing,Digital,Organization",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/three-business-books-to-start-your-summer,"Three business books to start your summer June 15, 2017 McKinsey consultants have always liked to write. In fact, our founder, James O. McKinsey, was not only a business professor and trusted adviser to CEOs but also a prolific author. His first book was Budgetary Control , a seminal work on financial management, published in 1922. Ninety years and over 100 published books later, we’re delighted to announce the publication of three new books by McKinsey authors. Digital @ Scale , by Anand Swaminathan and Jürgen Meffert, senior partners in Digital McKinsey While everyone today is talking about digital, “few talk about how a digital transformation should be executed across organizations,” says Anand Swaminathan. “ Digital@Scale shows how to create a sense of urgency, what a winning plan is, and how to instill change in your company,” says Jürgen Meffert. Anand and Jürgen, along with some of the top experts in the field, have put together a playbook for senior leaders embarking on a digital journey. Citing over 50 case studies of both digital and non-digital companies, the book illustrates how to do digital transformations end to end and what the process should look like. For example, a global industrial company changed their entire business model from focusing on products to building out their data and analytics capabilities, and a global financial institution put in place the role of chief digital officer, among other initiatives. “Organizations, instead, need to come up with entirely new business models to drive new sources of revenue,” adds Jürgen. This could mean changing how the supply chain is managed and how customers are engaged to create an experience that is truly omnichannel. You can order the book here . Leading Organizations: Ten Timeless Truths , by Scott Keller and Mary Meaney, senior partners in our Organization Practice In their new book, Scott Keller and Mary Meaney set out to break through the clutter of buzzwords, hype, and often-contradictory assertions business leaders receive on the topic of how best to manage their organizations. “Many of today’s leaders are addicted to novelty—on the constant search for what’s new,” says Scott. “Too often, though, this quest comes at the expense of putting into practice what’s already proven to be true.” Scott and Mary bring the best of their over 40 collective years of experience in advising C-suite executives and combine it with learnings from a wide variety of external sources. The result is a one-stop shop for fact-based, insightful, and practical advice on topics such as talent and teamwork, decision making and organization design, and culture and change. While the topics are timeless, the format of the book is decidedly timely. “Every big idea presented has a Twitter-friendly headline, followed by a short summary of the essentials with a killer infographic,” explains Scott. “We wanted every chapter to bring the same kind of intellectual adrenaline rush that comes from hearing a great TED Talk.” You can order the book here . The One Hour China Book (2017 edition) , by Jonathan Woetzel, director of McKinsey Global Institute and senior partner in Shanghai, and Jeffrey Towson , managing partner of Towson Capital and professor at Peking University Three years after the first edition of The One Hour China Book was published, Jonathan Woetzel and Jeff Towson knew it needed an update. “Three years in China is a really long time,” explains Jonathan. “We wanted to stay relevant in such a fast-changing space.” For example, since 2014, over 30 million people moved into Chinese cities, $400 billion in overseas acquisitions took place, and 20 million–plus people graduated from Chinese universities. As consumer spending continues to grow faster than GDP, the working Chinese consumer is predicted to make up over a third of global consumption growth until 2030. “Some trends are moving faster than others,” says Jonathan. “We found the Internet chapter needed an update more than the rest, since this sector, and smartphones in particular, move incredibly fast in China. In fact, it’s the most unpredictable sector.” You can order the book here . Never miss a story"

June 22, 2017 Matthias Evers, a molecular biochemist and McKinsey senior partner, stands in front of 100 young people—promising “Leaders of Tomorrow,” who want to pursue careers in life sciences, medicine, and chemistry. He was the keynote speaker at GapSummit, an intergenerational biotech forum held earlier this month. Also represented were research institutions, bio think tanks, and pharmaceutical companies. “Raise your hand if you are satisfied with how confident you feel in using your leadership skills in your work.” A few hands go up. Matthias repeats the directive, this time, asking those who are moderately satisfied to raise their hands. Again, a few hands go up. “Raise your hand if you are dissatisfied.” Ninety percent of the hands fly into the air. “This is typical of what I’ve seen across academic and scientific institutions and companies around the world,” he says. “Almost 100 percent of scientists—both young and tenured—believe that leadership ability is critical to their success, yet 75 percent say they don’t have the right opportunities to develop these traits.” While scientific innovation often requires collaborating, science education focuses on individual achievement, according to Matthias. Young scientists typically work on projects alone and are promoted based on technical accomplishment. “At the senior level then, you have strong technical experts, but few who have the ability to lead groups,” he says. “Great science leaders emerge more by luck than through talent development.” One of Matthias’ key messages is about how much the research environment is changing—it’s volatile and ambiguous. For instance, in drug innovation, generating new disease insight is more complicated than ever, requiring coordination across different disciplines and organizations. Researchers operate in a global information environment that runs 24/7, with new specialties such as data analytics and inexact boundaries between companies, institutions, and sectors. “It’s not enough to be a great scientist today,” Matthias says, “we need science excellence combined with leadership.” What does this mean in practical terms? Scientists need to be able to engage and lead a team of experts with diverse skills, mind-sets, and backgrounds. They need to be able to inspire a results-oriented but risk-taking culture and be resilient in the face of setbacks and failure that can be common in research. And they need to learn these skills early on. Matthias has been working to raise awareness of this skills gap since 2014, when an impromptu survey of young scientists at an event revealed a near unanimous appetite for leadership training. The trend has remained consistent. Since then, he has been a frequent speaker on the topic. At the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting last June, he hosted a panel with the 2011 physics Nobel laureate Brian Schmidt, industry leaders, and two young scientists to share their own stories of leadership and challenges. Reflecting on his own academic experience, Matthias says, “A scientist’s first instinct is to design an experiment or read a paper. I would have been a more far more productive and better scientist if I knew then how to find and engage the right person on a project—at McKinsey, we are not shy about finding the right expert wherever she or he might be located—and if I knew how to structure a problem and lead a team.” These are the basics of management consulting. “We can help our own pharma and life-sciences clients build leadership skills within their organizations,” he points out. “But there is a broader and urgent need for change at the university level around the world—in light of how fundamental science leadership is to national economies today.” Find out more about how we help organizations develop their leaders .

The Partnership on AI is a consortium of companies, academics, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and nonprofits dedicated to ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI) – the capacity for computer programs to learn, decide, and mimic other intelligent human behavior – is  developed in a safe, ethical, and transparent manner. “AI is the latest disruptive technology and should be very important to all leaders—whether they’re CEOs or policy makers—because it will affect every single sector of the economy. Every sector will rely on it in a meaningful way,” says James Manyika , director of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) and a senior partner based in McKinsey’s San Francisco office. The power of AI becomes more apparent by the day as it helps humans perform an ever-increasing number of tasks more efficiently or effectively than we could alone, from spotting potential tumors in medical scans to predicting in advance when critical machinery will fail. However, as AI establishes its presence in all aspects of society, both visibly and invisibly, it will have an impact that reaches beyond the tasks it deftly performs. MGI research demonstrates, for example, how AI has already changed the way dozens of jobs are carried out ––and is poised to transform the face of employment in the coming decades. “We’re keenly interested in making sure that AI is developed and implemented in a way that helps our society and doesn’t further entrench bias, discrimination, or inequality,” James explains. The Partnership will develop best practices in AI, which McKinsey will help shape and share in its own work. To encourage practitioners to take on pressing long-term social issues, the Partnership will host AI Grand Challenges and establish an award for the academic paper that contributes the most to “AI, people, and society.” It will also create Civil Society Fellowships, which will provide resources to nonprofits and NGOs that want to collaborate on topics within AI. Other for-profit organizations joining the Partnership along with McKinsey include eBay, Intel, Salesforce.com, and Sony; nonprofit partners include the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, and UNICEF. “We’re proud to join this group, especially as the first non-pure tech firm. Many may not realize it, but we have been working with our clients on AI, machine learning, and deep learning,” explains Michael Chui , a San Francisco-based partner at MGI who researches the impact of information technologies and innovation on society. McKinsey Analytics has assembled a team of data scientists, engineers, analysts, and business-to-technology “translators” who help clients improve performance by capturing and using the data created through their everyday activities. Through investments in growth and acquisitions and alliances with cutting-edge analytics firms, the depth and breadth of McKinsey’s AI expertise continues to grow. Over the past two years, the practice has served clients on over 2,000 engagements on a wide range of analytics and AI applications, such as customer retention, pricing and promotion strategies, fraud prevention, talent retention, and predictive maintenance.

Combining design with data to reimagine ridesharing,A joint team of colleagues from LUNAR and our Automotive & Assembly practice set out to create a ridesharing experience of the future.,2017-07-13T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Design,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/combining-design-with-data-to-reimagine-ridesharing,"Combining design with data to reimagine ridesharing Design concept #1: A reconfigurable interior that enhances the rider experience and allows drivers to capture a broader range of rideshare use cases. July 13, 2017 Ridesharing, as a way of getting around, is here to stay. “We’ve seen an explosion of e-hailing and ridesharing platforms in recent years that has changed the transportation landscape in urban areas,” says Jeff Salazar , partner with LUNAR , a design firm acquired by McKinsey in 2015 and now part of McKinsey Design . Yet ridesharing accounts for only about 1 percent of all vehicle miles traveled in the United States, with significant room for growth—“so we joined forces with experts from our Automotive & Assembly Practice , including McKinsey partner Russell Hensley . Our core team of six set out to create a ridesharing experience that could appeal to a wider range of people, stay relevant over time, and leverage emerging technologies,” explains Jeff. “We wanted to push the thinking around ridesharing and project an opinion of our own on where we think it could go across near and long-term horizons,” says David McGaw , recent Insights director at LUNAR. What started as 16 potential ideas, ranging from transportation of larger groups to manufacturing of cars, eventually narrowed down to 2 plausible vehicle design concepts. One is a new vehicle interior concept that enables more ridesharing scenarios than conventional privately owned cars. Its reconfigurable interior includes more back-seat room for easier entry and exit, a size-adaptable booster seat for parents traveling with children, and space that can be used for wheelchairs or for package delivery in off-hours. The second concept is designed specifically for commuters—providing a comfortable, highly tailored ride to work that is more relaxed than driving a personal car and comparably priced to mass transit. The van-like vehicle features rotating swivel seats that allow for either socializing or privacy, allowing passengers to talk to  their neighbors, do work, relax, or just close their eyes. Both designs integrate app experiences that allow riders to control in-vehicle features such as music and temperature from their phones. A rear-seat display of the route is also available so riders don’t need to use their data plan to check directions and maps while en route. An integrated social platform also allows for passengers and drivers to share personal background/interest profiles to help create a more pleasant and social ride experience. What inspired these two concepts? “We rode along with real commuters and rideshare passengers—25 to be exact— and conducted eight driver interviews to understand what’s working and where there are opportunities to improve the current rideshare experience,” recalls David. “While we were collecting user insights and discussing potential design ideas, our automotive experts analyzed and filtered the data, such as how dense a population needs to be for a shared commuting service to be viable in the area,” explains LUNAR designer Nick Ross , who comes from a background in construction and heavy machinery. “We put design behind our ideas, and our automotive team backed it up with strong fact-based analysis, such as where people live and commute and how crowded the roads are,” adds fellow designer DK Lee , formerly of BMW. “The six-month-long project reflects the integration of truly disparate skills within the firm,” says Nick. “We engaged with more than ten experts from the Automotive & Assembly Practice on the mechanics of cars and manufacturing principles.” DK adds: “All along, the LUNAR and McKinsey folks were looking at the same information but through very different lenses. Where we met in the middle highlighted the opportunities.” Anyone or any company—from automakers and auto parts suppliers, who could work together, to municipalities looking to tackle future mobility and transportation challenges—can draw from these insights and apply them as they wish. The team sees the greatest potential if ridesharing expands beyond the way it’s primarily used today—by young adults in urban areas—toward suburban families and into adjacent industries.  Given the continuously changing and expanding nature of the rideshare category, this work represents the first step in the journey to exploring broader solutions. “The key for us is that any potential solution that enhances the promise of future mobility will benefit from bringing a ‘whole-brained’ approach to solve the problem,” says Jeff. “Any ridesharing solution needs to be inspired by user input, backed by analytics, and delivered in ways that resonate with—and delight—the end user.” Stay current on your favorite topics Never miss a story"
Five things you may not know about Digital McKinsey,A sample of some of the new and unexpected (for some) directions Digital McKinsey is taking.,2017-07-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Digital,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/five-things-you-may-not-know-about-digital-mckinsey,"Five things you may not know about Digital McKinsey July 19, 2017 Given that technology has been a core part of McKinsey’s work for decades, we can confidently say that from all of our experience, the businesses that embrace digital are the ones that will thrive. This holds true for us as well. As we continue to evolve in the digital age of lightning-speed change, we’re expanding in new and unexpected (for some) directions and experimenting with new ideas. Here is a sample of what we’ve been up to recently. 1.  WE HIRE DESIGNERS, CODERS, AND DATA ENGINEERS To keep up with the changing needs of our clients, we are making changes of our own. And so we’re bringing in more people with varied—and perhaps unexpected— types of backgrounds (like this one ) and skills, across six continents. Over 1,500 designers, coders, data engineers, developers, agile coaches, business consultants, and others are currently part of Digital McKinsey. They come from some of the world’s leading tech companies, creative agencies, and start-ups, as well as through acquisitions—such as design agency Carbon12 from last fall. Explore the types of roles we have here . 2. WE’RE COACHING AS WE GO Beyond helping clients conceive of ideas for inventive products, services, and experiences, we’re working side-by-side with them to not only design and build but also improve their processes and capabilities. That way, they can keep innovating even after we are gone. Being digital means being agile, using prototypes as a problem-solving tool, and building a culture around experimentation. A few recent examples of our work include: Digitizing a fast-food chain We launched an entirely new food-delivery app and website, recruited top digital talent to build a new digital unit from scratch, and created a standalone digital center of excellence that continues to iterate and innovate on its own today and is now the model for other markets to follow. Launching a new mobile-banking app In just 16 weeks, we launched a new app that lets users send money to friends. Within a month of its release, it reached the number-one spot in the local Apple App Store and performed tens of thousands of transactions. Using robotics to process life insurance The users we work with aren’t just consumers; they can be employees too. After analyzing the experiences of teams at a life insurance company, we built a robotic-process-automation tool that automated numerous activities. It freed up employees’ time for other work, dropped policy conversion time by 50 percent, and lowered processing costs by more than 80 percent. 3.  WE’VE GOT EIGHT NEW ADDRESSES Part of being digital means actually experiencing digital. Brainstorming great ideas and developing a strategy are a start, but the user experience is critical. That’s why we believe our teams and our clients need to be immersed in it—to touch, feel, and experience new technologies. In Berlin, Toronto, New York, Singapore, Aachen, Chicago, Venice and Beijing, we’ve opened new spaces for clients to do just that. They include: Experience Studios Spaces for clients to interact with cutting-edge technologies, learn from leading tech companies, and network with potential partners. Visit us here . Digital Capability Centers A network of factories for participants to experiment with Industry 4.0 technologies to understand first-hand how they can reshape manufacturing and operations. And here ! 4.  WE’RE AT THE CENTER OF A GLOBAL NETWORK OF LEADING TECH COMPANIES To help clients quickly scale up, we’ve expanded our ecosystem of partners with over 150 leading technology-related product and service providers. They’re helping to bring new ideas, innovations, and capabilities to our clients—and we are working side-by-side with their top experts to do so. Plus, we’re continuing to build out our own technology library with in-house offerings like microservices, a cloud platform, sector-specific platforms, and more. Having the best-in-class technology and expertise as part of our network help our clients test and go to market faster than ever before. 5.  WE’RE TAKING OUR IDEAS ON THE ROAD From Cannes to Paris, from Lisbon to Barcelona, from Hong Kong to Bengaluru, and from Austin to Davos—we’re out on the tradeshow circuit shaping the conversation on cutting-edge topics, like artificial intelligence, robotics, creativity, and design. To name just a few: Above, Jason Heller , Digital McKinsey partner, presented at last month’s Cannes Lions Festival our work in establishing a link between creativity and business performance. Our methodology? We developed an index coined the Award Creativity Score (ACS) that is based on 16 years of data from the Cannes Lions awards, given annually for advertising and marketing excellence. The analysis revealed creativity is in fact associated with superior performance. Businesses that scored higher on the index all share a dedicated focus on innovation and creativity, customer centricity, speed, and adaptability. Read more here .

How to protect your business from a cyberattack,A series of high-profile attacks have elevated cyber security from a technology issue to a strategic imperative. Learn how McKinsey’s Cyber Solutions team helps clients understand and navigate cyber risks.,2017-08-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/cyberrisk/cybersecurity_hero_1536x864.jpg,Solutions,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/four-cyber-solutions-help-clients-build-resilience,"How to protect your business from a cyberattack August 23, 2017 In the first 6 months of 2017, there have been an unprecedented number of cyberattacks, from the hacking of presidential elections to leaks of government spy tools to breaches of major corporations. McKinsey is growing its Cyber Solutions team, which now has 30-plus cyber risk experts, led by Solutions Vice President Dayne Myers . In the 1990s, Dayne started his career at McKinsey and then left to run a number of early-stage technology companies, including a cyber software firm he cofounded and led from 2002 to 2007. He rejoined McKinsey last year. In a recent interview, he explains how we are helping clients in this critical area. What role is the firm taking in the area of cyber risk? Before the past 5 years or so, cyber security was viewed mostly as a technology issue overseen by the IT department. That has changed due to a series of high-profile cyberattacks that hit well-known companies. The attacks compromised customer data and resulted in substantial financial loss, damage to reputation, and in some cases, the CEO losing his or her job. Some businesses that were in the process of being acquired, when hit by a cyberattack, found that their valuations were significantly cut. These events started waking up boards and CEOs to the fact that cyber security is now a strategic issue and even an existential risk. McKinsey's 20+ years of experience in business technology combined with our strength in serving senior leaders of organizations have made us a natural partner on cyber security as the threat grows. What sorts of challenges are we helping clients with today? Beyond concerns about high-profile attacks, CEOs are thinking about metrics and capabilities. They’re wondering, “Are we as a company doing the right things? Are we spending our money in the right ways?” At the same time, the chief information security officer (CISO) may need support in how to communicate highly technical information effectively to his or her board. Several years ago, I met with the chairman of a Fortune 500 company whose board had just spent hours on cyber security in a board meeting, yet he felt he and his fellow directors still didn’t fully understand where they stood. Cyber Solutions does exactly what he wished for: we help executives and their boards determine if their companies are doing the right things as well as getting a good return on the money they spend on cyber security—and we help them figure out the cybermarket. Other examples of our work: If a client is considering acquiring a cybercompany, we assist with due diligence. We help our investor clients, such as venture-capital firms, figure out if their existing portfolio companies are effectively protected against cyberattacks. We also work with product manufacturers to ensure that their product-development processes are secure from hacking. We serve a variety of organizations across industries to help them secure their customer, citizen, and patient data, without putting “sand in the gears” with respect to their overall user experience. McKinsey has a portfolio of Cyber Solutions. Tell us more about how these work. There are four solutions, based on our research and analytics, and they are designed to work as a program.
Clients typically start with a Digital Resilience Assessment to get a picture as to where they stand compared with best practices and with similar companies. We look at such things as how they manage their defenses and organize their security operations. From there, we help them to determine a set of initiatives to improve their cyber resilience. The next step is Cyber Risk Insights , a cloud-based tool and related process that helps clients identify the data and systems that are most critical to their business and evaluate areas of vulnerability and risk. For example, is a business effectively securing its customer data, product specifications, or other kinds of intellectual property? The Executive Cyber Simulation offering uses gaming techniques to simulate cyberattack scenarios for company leadership. It’s not a test of whether the company can repel a certain attack but rather determines the readiness of the executives to make critical decisions in a short time frame during a serious breach. For example, we might simulate the shutdown of critical facilities by a hacker who demands a ransom, or we might simulate the loss of patient data for a healthcare provider. We customize the situation to the client’s business so that it’s a realistic scenario. By testing the readiness of management teams in a no-risk environment, we can highlight preparedness gaps and help a company strengthen its ability to respond before a breach takes place. We advise clients to conduct such a test regularly to build decision-making “muscle memory,” so that they’re not learning on the fly when a crisis strikes. We can also help them develop detailed incident-response plans. Our fourth solution, Cyber Market Map , serves a different purpose. Through it, we track the entire cyber security market, including hardware, software, and services firms. We can rapidly help our clients identify, understand, and respond to growth and acquisition opportunities and consumer trends. What is the one piece of advice you'd give to a CEO? Think about this as a risk just like any other—economic, financial, or personnel—and manage it accordingly. Cyber risk is not going to be solved by just technology, and it’s never going away. There are tremendous advantages to being digital and on the cloud, but with great potential comes some risk. CEOs shouldn’t be scared of cyber risk. Instead, they should identify it, understand it, invest in it, and prioritize ways to handle it. Be as resilient as you can. Never miss a story"
"&ldquo;Digital Days&rdquo; in Latin America

 
","The adoption of digital continues to be a bright spot in Latin America’s economy today, evidenced by  our growing series of &ldquo;Digital Day&rdquo; events in the region.",2017-08-25T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Digital,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/digital-days-in-latin-america,"“Digital Days” in Latin America Heitor Martins, senior partner, presenting at “Digital Day” in Medellín  earlier this month. August 25, 2017 A bright spot in Latin America’s economy today and a key priority for growth is the adoption of digital and automation technologies . The excitement around the topic has been evident at our series of “Digital Day” events around the region, where we’ve had the opportunity to meet thousands of executives and discuss the future of digital in the region. Late last year, 1,200 clients attended our “Digital Day” in São Paulo, Brazil; in March, we hosted over 200 attendees in Mexico City; in May, we hosted 400 attendees in Lima, Peru; earlier this month, we held events for over 400 attendees in Medellín and Bogotá, Colombia; and in October, we’ll be in Santiago, Chile. “We’re seeing a lot of innovation initiatives happening in Latin America, especially in Colombia, with an increasing number of investors and venture-capital firms looking to fund start-ups,” says Adriana Vargas , a software architect who joined Digital McKinsey in Bogotá at the end of last year. She has a decade of experience in developing digital platforms for both the public and private sectors. Adriana is among the more than ten new hires to join the Bogotá office in recent months in order to help clients innovate their existing IT architectures as well as build new ones from scratch. In Brazil, nearly 30 new people have joined Digital McKinsey in just this past year in our São Paulo office, including Marcelo Tripoli, former chief creative officer of SapientNitro in Latin America. With offices in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and now Panama, we’re serving the growing digitization needs for both incumbent companies and start-ups. “While Latin American economies are not as large as the US or some Asian countries, they offer the demand for and ability to support digital investments,” says Heitor Martins , a senior partner in São Paulo. “So we see many of McKinsey’s most important digital transformations in the world taking place in LatAm.” For example, Adriana was on a team of 15 digital specialists that recently helped a Peruvian bank develop an account-opening app that uses facial-recognition software to authenticate users. The momentum from the project inspired the client to set up a new digital center of excellence to perpetuate a culture of digital and agile thinking. “This model has already been applied successfully to several other clients since that time,” shares Adriana. Another story of impact is from a Brazilian insurance company where we helped launch an entirely new and separate digital start-up and brand. Over 12 months, our agile coaches, designers, and developers worked alongside the client to develop an internal set of IT solutions and customer-facing web sites and apps, and to recruit a digital native team of 50+ experts. “When clients come to our ‘Digital Day’ events and see what’s possible—and what other companies are already achieving—it’s a big step forward in helping them imagine their own transformations,” explains Heitor.

Inside the making of our film on reinvention,A behind-the-scenes look into how this film was made and what reinvention means to both our clients and to our firm.,2017-09-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/inside%20the%20making%20of%20our%20film%20on%20reinvention/reinvention-vid_thumb_1536x1536.jpg,Digital,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/inside-the-making-of-our-film-on-reinvention,"Inside the making of our film on reinvention September 8, 2017 Our passion for helping our clients reinvent led us to make a short film on the topic, which was released a couple of weeks ago. “This video is meant to celebrate the successes of our clients’ truly transformative work,” explains Peter Dahlström , who heads McKinsey’s communications and is one of the leaders of Digital McKinsey , “and also to explain how McKinsey is different today than many people might expect.” In this “behind the scenes” film, we go on set to talk to the film’s creators about how it was made and what reinvention means to both our clients and to our firm. McKinsey has a long history of helping clients make significant, transformative change in their organizations. Today, partnering with our clients to reinvent themselves is more important than ever, and doing that today requires a lot more different tools and working models than it used to. In fact, more than 50 percent of the work we do today did not exist 10 years ago, like digital labs , analytics , implementation , design , restructuring , or our software solutions . “Digitization is remaking almost every aspect of our personal and work lives, raising our expectations about customer experiences, and bringing a new transparency across the spectrum of products, customer service, and pricing,” says Peter. “Businesses are under pressure to cut costs and improve services, and to do that means they need to reinvent the way they do business, the kinds of people they hire, and how their organizations and processes are structured.” “One of the things we are doing that is different and new for McKinsey is quickly developing solutions, prototyping, and building them with clients through an iterative and agile process,” says vice president of experience design Kwame Nyanning . “The average person doesn’t expect to have a conversation with McKinsey on a Monday and at the end of the week have something in their hands. And it’s this capability to rapidly demonstrate what's possible—and then scale it— that is so unique to us,” he adds. The “star” of the film is a monolithic sculpture that has been programmed to shoot glass spheres into the air with such precision that they create an image to represent the featured client cases—including an insurer, a mining company, and a government. “It’s a conceptual way of illustrating the reinvention work we've been doing with our clients,” explains Peter. “For me, the physicality of it reflects the new McKinsey—it required engineering, design, and hands-on operational work to build it.” Interested to learn more about our reinvention?

"This week, VLT Labs joins McKinsey Digital Labs","VLT Labs, a Malaysian team of digital and design experts, is joining our Digital Labs team in Kuala Lumpur, an addition that will help meet the growing demand for digital and design work within Southeast Asia.",2017-09-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Acquisitions,Digital,Asia,Design",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/this-week-vlt-labs-joins-mckinsey-digital-labs,"This week, VLT Labs joins McKinsey Digital Labs Nimal Manuel , senior partner in Kuala Lumpur, announcing the acquihire of VLT Labs at the McKinsey Innovation Forum in Malaysia September 20, 2017 In just 4 years since its founding, VLT Labs , a digital business builder and product development studio based in Kuala Lumpur , has made quite an impression in the region. Having already helped clients build 53 new products and businesses, their work is reshaping the way people live—how they hire help, buy homes, cook dinner, manage their money, follow the news, schedule haircuts, and even talk to their doctors. As of today, the Malaysian team of digital and design experts is joining our Digital Labs team in Kuala Lumpur. This addition bumps up our number of engineers, designers, user-experience (UX) and digital experts to meet the booming demand for digital work across Southeast Asia—notably in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. We spoke with legacy VLT Labs’ two cofounders, Izwan Ismail , an industrial, medical, software, and product designer, and Andrew Tan , an electrical engineer and innovation strategist, about what this acquihire (i.e., the acquisition of talent and assets) means to both their company—and McKinsey. In addition to leading  client service at VLT Labs, the two are actively involved in helping to build the digital design industry within Malaysia today. What talent is VLT Labs bringing to McKinsey? We invest a lot in user experience training since most designers in the region, and especially in Malaysia, come from traditional visual graphic-design backgrounds. As a small group, we’re able to be nimble and flexible—conceptualizing, designing, and building web and mobile-based applications, products, and new ventures— from the ground up. Our areas of focus include user experience and user-interface design, consumer research, design strategy, chatbot computing, mobile development, and full-stack engineering. We’ve built products—ranging in size and scale—for both start-ups and big corporations. We’ve been actively involved in the start-up and entrepreneurship community here in Kuala Lumpur and have been able to grow quite a network of designers and tech folks within the region. How will this acquihire change the way you serve clients? As part of the McKinsey network, we’re excited to have greater reach and the opportunity to serve a wider range of clients and much bigger brands. We’ll be able to work with McKinsey’s industry teams and strategy and analytics experts to design new products and/or experiences. We’ve been really focused on building and launching [products/services], but with this acquihire and McKinsey’s experience in organizational design , growth strategies , and capability building , we can help our clients get to that next step—and sustain their transformations for the long-term. What types of projects do you work on? It really runs the gamut. We’re pretty industry agnostic, working across telecoms, insurance, banking, and fashion. Earlier this year, we partnered with McKinsey in delivering a banking app for a Southeast Asian bank that was threatened by fast-growing digital competitors. Recently, we helped launch a chatbot machine-learning app for an Australian fashion brand, and now we’re developing the technology for an urban farming company to help ensure optimal pH balance for fish in aquariums. Across all our projects, we partner with clients to figure out how best to transform their ideas into something tangible and executable. Once it’s out there in the market, we do a lot of user testing to see how people respond, and then we iterate. Typically, our engagements are no longer than 2 to 4 months since our goal as a business builder is to be able to hand over a fully functioning team and operation to the client so they can launch quickly. How are you tapping into the growth in design that’s happening in Asia? UX is playing an integral role in Southeast Asia—across start-ups, big corporations, and even education. The challenge, however, is finding good talent. A lot of companies are talking about UX and trying to embrace it, and many universities are exploring ways to develop these skills. Since we started, we’ve been bringing in designers and training them with knowledge on how to research user behavior and design for the best type of experience. It’s so important for a UX designer to be able to understand the users for which they’re designing and how to transfer conceptual ideas into executable ones that will delight. How will VLT Labs’ culture mesh with McKinsey’s? In many ways, we’re very similar. At VLT Labs, we’ve fostered a culture of deep respect for one another, valuing each other’s perspectives since we too are a global team. Like McKinsey, we share that same hunger for knowledge and passion for doing excellent work. Despite our obvious differences in size, we both follow very specific work processes in how we approach client problems and reach solutions. It’s a very collaborative and iterative style that is focused on transferring all capabilities over to the client to be able to run on their own once we are gone. What will be new and exciting for us is tapping into McKinsey’s much vaster base of knowledge and expertise. Coming from  a small team to an organization of thousands and thousands will mean we’ll now be able to reach out to anyone in the world for any specific set of knowledge in a field. That’s pretty cool. related New faces at McKinsey Design: A Q&A with Collin Cole Never miss a story"
Our busy UN Week,"This year, during UN General Assembly week, McKinsey colleagues had the opportunity to share research and take part in conversations about innovation, gender parity and philanthropy.",2017-09-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-busy-week-at-un-week,"Our busy UN Week James Manyika, chairman of McKinsey Global Institute, moderated a panel  on the role of innovation in helping countries meet the Sustainable Development Goals. September 21, 2017 For many people, September marks the end of vacation—back to school or work. For New Yorkers, it’s also the time for the UN General Assembly (UNGA), a whirlwind week of a meetings, summits, and receptions attended by leaders from almost every country in the world. This year it was also an opportunity for our colleagues to share McKinsey’s latest research on topics ranging from the future of work and gender parity to the changing face of philanthropy.  Here are some highlights from the week: San Francisco-based senior partner James Manyika , who is also chairman of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), moderated Innovation Lab , a panel discussion on the role of innovation in helping countries meet the Sustainable Development Goals . James opened the discussion with a question: “How can governments and innovators build trust and come together to solve our most pressing problems?” The panel focused on how government and business can create hubs of innovation, such as Silicon Valley, on a wider scale; develop networks for sharing ideas, talent and resources; and source ideas from the ground up.  The panel included H.E. Miroslav Lajčák, President of the United Nations General Assembly, H.E. Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia, Reid Hoffman, Founder and Chair of LinkedIn, Marc Benioff, CEO and Founder of Salesforce, among others. The discussion also included members of the audience, comprised of heads of state, CEOs of leading tech firms and startups, activists and visionaries. One startup executive offered help in measuring progress toward the various SDGs by sharing its growing mass of satellite images, which could be used to track agriculture, reservoirs, and deforestation. A tech executive pointed out that for all the focus on advanced technologies, millions still lack basic Internet connectivity. A government leader emphasized the need to update taxation in a digital world in which people can work in three countries in a single day. Elsewhere this week: Philanthropy - McKinsey serves as the knowledge partner for the annual Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy, which used the occasion of their centenary to focus on the theme of “Soutions for the next 100 years.”  Four McKinsey colleagues led discussions: Kweilin Ellingrud , partner, on imagining  “A World Where Girls Have The Same Opportunity As Boys”;  Arnie Ghatak, senior partner and Tracy Nowski, associate partner, on how to create your own philanthropy; and Manisha Gulati, a partner, on financial vehicles for philanthropy. Business and society - This year McKinsey collaborated with the Concordia Summit, a nonpartisan forum taking place alongside the U.N.

Riding Wave 2 into the digital age,"Companies across industries use our Wave solution to manage transformations. A new version, Wave 2, designed from the ground up with client input, is intuitive, collaborative, and transparent—and available now.",2017-10-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Solutions,Digital",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/riding-wave-2-into-the-digital-age,"Riding Wave 2 into the digital age Left, Justine Ellis, Wave client relationship manager, and Erwin Sie, Wave client success specialist,  are at a mining operation in Australia following Wave 2 train-the-trainer sessions. Particularly challenging was the widespread  distribution of these mines and the often isolated locations that made collaboration difficult. Wave was used as a centralized platform for tracking the performance and completion of thousands of cost-saving initiatives. October 12, 2017 A hospital in Manchester, United Kingdom wanted to reduce the rate of pressure ulcers, one of the most chronic, vexing problems in patient care, and one that often results in extended stays. It asked nurses to identify the most effective treatment methods and to record how often they rotated and checked on patients. Using Wave , our program-management solution, nurses tracked a set of initiatives that focused on preventing ulcers in the first place—and were able to establish best practices for improving overall care. A gas utility in northern California wanted to improve its stations and pipelines to better meet regulatory standards and find new ways to deliver service at a lower cost. Electrical engineers first codified design changes in Wave and then transferred them into physical drawings, which more than 3,000 workers used in the construction process. Wave is a web-based software and services solution designed by McKinsey to help companies facilitate large-scale transformation programs by tracking initiatives from the idea phase through to execution. Wave aggregates information across thousands of initiatives over multiyear projects, visualizes the content, and reports on what matters most to a business. Launched in 2011, Wave quietly built a following and became our biggest solution , with 80,000 users globally. This month, McKinsey is announcing the rollout of an updated version—Wave 2—which was redesigned from scratch, based on user feedback, to be faster, more intuitive and more collaborative. “Wave 2 saves users time so they can focus on what matters most in their programs,” said Gregory Schor , the McKinsey partner who oversees the Wave solution. “We also created a continuous feedback loop, which enables us to fully focus on our clients’ needs.” Used extensively by client teams in our RTS , Operations , and M&A Practices , Wave can be preloaded with key elements such as default configurations, prebuilt initiatives, and templates based on the specific know-how that McKinsey has developed over time. It can be used to set up roles and responsibilities, track work-stream progress and projection, flag problems, and show actual impact. Wave’s applications are virtually unlimited. Our clients who work in mining, government, retail, the food and beverage industry, and at airplane manufacturers use it. “Wave gives you the 21st-century tools to manage enterprise programs. It’s all about agility, collaboration, transparency, and helping people be more efficient,” said Michel  Morenville , vice president of product and technology and Wave 2’s  chief designer. The engineers behind Wave 2 had to build the software from the ground up the same way it functions—agile and fast. “We engage with a number of our top clients weekly for feedback on the latest features and product road map, and we hear their ideas,” said Rory   Walsh , director of engineering, who was responsible for Wave 2’s implementation. Meanwhile at the UK hospital, “Wave has helped nurses track how much time they spend on administrative tasks versus patient interaction so we can prioritize and improve care; administrators find ways to improve productivity by reducing paperwork or streamlining the choice of medical devices,” said a hospital representative. “Wave makes it easy to follow through on initiatives and see the impact of our efforts.” Never miss a story"
The research behind Women Matter: 10 years on,Senior Partner Sandrine Devillard reflects on a decade of McKinsey's research on gender equality.,2017-10-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/ten-years-of-women-matter-research,"The research behind Women Matter: 10 years on McKinsey Senior Partners Sandra Sancier-Sultan (left) and Sandrine Devillard have led our research into advancing gender parity over the past ten years A Q&A with Sandrine Devillard October 16, 2017 This October marks the 10th anniversary of McKinsey’s research on gender equality. Gender diversity, a corporate performance driver was the first of a series of reports we titled Women Matter that continues today. Just last week we presented findings from the latest edition at the Women’s Forum for the Economy and Society event in Paris. Since 2007, the scope of our research has extended from women in top management to women at all levels and to women in society. Along the way, we have looked at regional and country-level trends, including in Africa, Australia, Canada, the Gulf, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to name a few. We've also just published the 2017 edition of our annual Women in the Workplace survey with LeanIn.Org and later this year we'll release an update to our Diversity Matters research, which looks at the business case for types of diversity beyond gender. Collectively, this body of work remains some of McKinsey’s most popular research, filling three of the five top spots on the list of our most cited reports last year. Sandrine Devillard is a McKinsey senior partner who is known as the “mother” of Women Matter . In this interview, she reflects on the journey over the last 10 years. How did the idea for Women Matter come about in the first place? Ten years ago, gender parity in the workplace was not exactly a hot topic. Business leaders either did not think there was an issue—and some even thought that they had already solved it. I was working in Paris at that time, and I was leading what we called our Women’s  Initiative. I found myself attending lots of meetings and forums, with amazing women—and brave men who dared to come to those events. There was a community that was interested in the topic, but a notable lack of substance to the debate. Without facts, it seemed to rest on a sense of ethical duty, which never felt right to me. I remember telling this to Eric Labaye , who led our Paris Office at that time, and his reaction was: “Really? We have to do something about that!” So he, I and our colleague Georges Desvaux, set out to make the business case for gender parity. When you embarked upon this research for the first time, it was uncharted territory. Did you, or your colleagues, have any reservations that you might not reach the findings you were looking for? We decided to start by looking at the relationship between the number of women on a company’s executive committee and its organizational health and financial performance. The truth is we didn't know if we would be able to find a correlation. One person, who will remain nameless, did ask me what we would do if we found that there was a negative correlation between women in top management and corporate performance. I told him we would cross that bridge when we came to it. Of course, these fears were unfounded. We found a statistically robust correlation, and we now know, beyond doubt, that companies that have more women on their executive committees perform better and have higher financial returns. What has changed in the landscape of women in the workplace over the last 10 years? The initial response to Women Matter was overwhelming. We were delighted. But perhaps what has been most surprising over the years is the longevity of the research—it has really stuck. Five or six years on from our first report, I would still walk into meetings with CEOs who would have a copy of it on their desks and want to talk about it. Our research has evolved, too. From the starting point of that correlation between women in executive roles in companies and business performance we moved on to try to understand the barriers that exist to reaching parity and how organizations can address them. Within business, I’m most pleased that we’ve recently started to see a shift in mind-sets. It wasn’t until 4 years ago that our survey showed the majority of male middle managers agreed with the statement: “Many studies have demonstrated that companies with more women in leadership positions perform better.” Outside business, in broader society, it’s become a priority topic, too, which is really encouraging. We know from McKinsey Global Institute’s Power of Parity research that if women participated equally in work with men, there is an opportunity to unlock $28 trillion in economic potential. But achieving this depends upon creating equality for women in society; for example, access to education and addressing their share of unpaid care work. Do you have personal highlights from this journey? I’m continually surprised—and delighted—by the level of interest our research receives from clients and from the media. But the team has also been privileged to speak in a number of public forums: from the Korean Parliament to the European Commission to the French House of Representatives to the United Nations. I think I’m most proud of the way that our research has started to shape not only the way business thinks about women but also society more widely. Countries have passed laws about gender equality. The UN Sustainable Development Goals have a goal dedicated to gender equality and empowering women and girls. If we’ve helped that in any small way, it’s very gratifying. What’s next on the horizon for this agenda? We know from our research that what ultimately drives organizational health and performance is not just women’s representation in companies but also the company’s inclusive culture—the way in which all colleagues are equally accepted, respected, and engaged in the business, regardless of gender or other characteristics. The challenge ahead lies in achieving this, and that requires sustained, multiyear, organization-wide change efforts, changing mind-sets, and transforming performance models—a whole ecosystem. Everything we know, and everything that has been achieved so far, gives me cause for optimism. But still, women make up less than 25 percent of management positions globally, so there is no doubt that we need to accelerate. Indeed, the same is true for us here at McKinsey. For many years, we’ve been working to increase the representation of women at every level of our firm. Like other organizations, we’ve made some good progress—particularly at the entry level—but still have work to do. As a female leader of our firm, I’m determined that we’re going to get there.

"In 2018, GII brings the global infrastructure conversation to London",London will be the next city to host the 2018 Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII) Summit.  It’s part of an ongoing effort to improve the way the industry delivers essential infrastructure and maximizes existing assets.,2017-10-25T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Capital Projects and Infrastructure,Europe",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/in-2018-gii-brings-the-global-infrastructure-conversation-to-london,"In 2018, GII brings the global infrastructure conversation to London In 2016, GII led a group of infrastructure leaders from ten countries to visit Crossrail, one of London’s most ambitious undertakings. The 73-mile railway links the four economic hubs of the city. Participants explored innovative approaches for delivering megaprojects—those that cost $1 billion or more to deliver. October 25, 2017 Sweden is experimenting with an “e-Highway” for large-scale freight trucks, a combination of electrified rail and overhead cables. The goal is to eliminate reliance on fossil-fuel vehicles by 2030. In China, 90 percent of a skyscraper can be built in the controlled environment of a factory—and at the end of its life, almost completely be recycled. In an industry that has its share of false starts and struggling projects, amazing things are happening—and learning from the best is one of the principles behind our Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII). GII brings together stakeholders from across the industry through a series of initiatives: a global summit, regional roundtables, innovation site visits and a quarterly publication. The overall goals are to share the best new ideas, pool expertise, and solve the industry’s structural issues, all with an eye to tangibly improving the way we deliver essential infrastructure and squeezing more out of our existing assets. This week, GII announced that London will be the host city for its fifth global summit next year:  October 29 to 31. GII is convened by our Capital Projects & Infrastructure (CP&I) Practice , which has nearly 500 consultants, engineers, developers, and experts helping clients plan, finance, deliver, and operate infrastructure and large capital projects worldwide. On the fifth anniversary of GII, we caught up with two of its leaders, Rob Palter and Tony Hansen . The idea for GII arose when the Infrastructure Practice first began. At the time, there were numerous events. “But most of them focused on a specific type of infrastructure–such as airports, roads, or ports–or a function such as finance or construction–or were regional in nature,” recalls Rob Palter, global coleader of the CP&I Practice. “There was no place where the entire industry could get together in a solutions-focused conversation.” So Palter and his team set out to create an event that would do this. The inaugural summit took place in 2012 at the Çırağan Palace in Istanbul. It soon became clear that there was a strong appetite for ongoing conversations and collective brainstorming—prompting Palter’s team to grow GII from a one-off summit to the continuous, year-round cycle of engagement. Regional roundtables focused on local issues, such as affordable housing in San Francisco , and innovation site visits were planned to “best in class” projects. These include the upcoming excursions to King Abdullah Economic City in Saudi Arabia, which has been master-planned from the desert up, and Hyperloop One in Las Vegas, Nevada, an electric, autonomous pod-and-tube transportation system with the potential to move people at 700 miles per hour. In addition, themed insights are published in our quarterly publication, Voices on Infrastructure . While the GII digital community has grown to more than 5,000 leaders, the summit attendance has been limited to under 200 participants. According to GII director Tony Hansen, this allows a high level of interaction and gives each participant a voice. The agenda blends plenary panel discussions, pitches for inspiring ideas, and small breakouts for hands-on, collaborative sessions about real projects . While networking and brainstorming are critical, the greater aspiration is for GII to improve the overall performance of infrastructure and move the industry forward. “At the Istanbul summit , many participants were reluctant to embrace the potential of technology,” says Hansen. “Just five years later, the role of technology and digital analytics in helping companies optimize assets is a priority for the industry. We encouraged this shift by making innovation a central part of our 2015 summit in San Francisco , our 2017 summit in Singapore , and our innovation site visit to GE Digital headquarters .” Digital transformation will continue to feature prominently in the 2018 Summit agenda. “Construction is one of the last industries to embrace new technologies,” explains Palter. “While there are a lot of ‘shiny objects’ on the market, such as drones and augmented reality, there is no pragmatic road map on how to actually implement these technologies, how much investment is required, what sort of talent to hire, what value is at stake.” Another concern is the successful execution of large infrastructure programs, such as Crossrail (pictured at top), an underground tunnel linking the four economic hubs of London, and Asia’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which aims to create economic, physical, and maritime corridors connecting China to most of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Conceptually, Palter says, the value is clear; yet the complexity of BRI, which involves more than 20 countries, makes it a Herculean effort despite widespread buy-in. “It’s not about managing single projects—but entire systems—whether a citywide water system, a bridge and tunnel structure, or transnational corridor—how do we bring these megaprojects in under budget and on time? It will take everyone’s best thinking.” Never miss a story"
Boosting the systems that fight cancer: Meet our oncology experts,"A paradox of our time: we’re living longer, healthier lives, but cancer’s impact on them will only increase.",2017-11-03T04:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Healthcare,AI & Analytics,Our People,Pharmaceuticals",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/boosting-the-systems-that-fight-cancer-meet-our-oncology-experts,"Boosting the systems that fight cancer: Meet our oncology experts Tissue culture. Science Photo Library - National Cancer Institute November 3, 2017 A paradox of our time: we’re living longer, healthier lives, but cancer’s impact on them will only increase. It’s the second-largest contributor to the burden of noncommunicable disease. In the global developed world, one person in three receives a cancer diagnosis at some point. An analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum estimated that the number of new cancer cases will rise to 21.5 million by 2030. Diagnosing, treating, and caring for cancer patients requires many complex systems—healthcare, social support, medical research, drug development, even political—to marshal the right resources in the right places. Ten years ago, London-based partner Dr. Björn Albrecht , a molecular oncologist by training, noticed that he and a group of other consultants with oncology expertise throughout the firm were always on call whenever projects dealing with cancer arose. Rather than continue to serve such clients on a reactive, ad-hoc basis, Björn gathered together these experts, established an advisory board of renowned cancer clinician-scientists, and built a market research and analytics infrastructure—now known as the McKinsey Cancer Center , which bundles the firm’s cancer knowledge and client service. Our work encompasses everything from helping drug companies discover, develop, and launch better medicines to developing national strategies on how to beat cancer, Björn explains. One of the center’s major assets is its ability to serve across sectors at the local, regional, and national levels. Since the center’s creation, its clients have included top companies doing cutting-edge work in pharma, biotech, and diagnostics; the world’s leading cancer centers; and healthcare systems. Björn gathered together the oncology experts within the firm, established an advisory board of renowned cancer clinician-scientists, and built an analytics infrastructure to form the center. Recent examples of the center’s work include building a multibillion-dollar cancer organization from scratch and working with five health systems around the globe to improve colorectal cancer care. This latter project saves 400 lives annually within those health systems, a mortality reduction of 10 percent prior to the interventions. We serve such a broad set of clients, but what it comes down to is understanding where the burden of the disease resides for each of our stakeholders, says Dr. Laura Furstenthal , a senior partner based in San Francisco and a cancer biologist by training. This is all accomplished by a core global team of about 30 consultants, each of whom can draw upon a background in science or medicine. Our model is staffing teams with people who are scientists at heart that ‘speak oncology,’ explains Philippe Menu , an associate partner based in Geneva. Some of us are scientists who understand the biology, some of us are physicians who understand what treatments look like and how doctors navigate the system, and many of us have family members who have had cancer. It’s a deeply passionate group of people, Laura adds. Björn, Laura, and Philippe, like their peers at the center, at one point considered very different careers. Björn had always expected to become a doctor, like his father. Then, in 1989, my dad brought home a research magazine, and it had an article about HIV in it, Björn remembers. The race to find a cure for this virus inspired him to study biology and pursue research on viruses. Many years later, he wrote his PhD dissertation on the science of a virus that causes an aggressive form of leukemia. After deciding that life in the lab wasn’t for him, Björn joined McKinsey in 2003 and jumped into projects that tied into his research. Laura had a similar urge to get out of the lab, after receiving her PhD in cancer biology from Stanford: Years in the lab, years in trials—I wanted something where I could see faster results. Ironically, her first project at McKinsey had her helping a Nobel laureate whose work she’d written her thesis on but hadn’t been able to meet. Laura jokes, I’ve been part of the Cancer Center since day one. Likewise, Philippe called on his MD–PhD in molecular biology of immunity and cancer for his first project at the firm and has been with the center ever since. In the years since the founding of the McKinsey Cancer Center, cancer treatments have become more advanced and complex as genetic sequencing and computing power have enabled more individualized approaches. Twenty years ago, you had lung cancer. Today, you could say that lung cancer actually doesn’t exist anymore per se; it’s more a collection of different lung-cancer types. We can now segment cancer patients according to their lung-cancer type based on specific biomarkers, and choose more targeted treatments for them accordingly, Philippe explains. Every year, McKinsey Cancer Center hosts a satellite symposium at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, where 40,000 industry members, scientists, and clinicians spend a week discussing the most recent clinical results and cancer drugs. At the satellite symposium, the center convenes about 150 clients from across the industry to discuss the latest developments. Last year’s symposium touched on the huge potential that data and data sharing could have for cancer treatment. New treatments, trials, and technologies will generate mountains of data, but if they remain isolated in silos, their true potential for patients will be lost. Take the airline industry—if I want a ticket from San Francisco to Venice, the IATA 1 1. International Air Transport Association. platforms let airlines collaborate to find me the right combination of tickets. That’s the kind of innovation that we need. It’s not going to be one company or one provider that solves the problem, but there will be thousands of combinations of therapies, and no individual doctor is going to be able to understand all of them without support, explains Laura. Björn is hopeful that new drugs, approaches to care, and ways of collaborating will improve cancer-survival rates. If we could make better-targeted therapies for patients— who will then respond at higher rates, respond longer term, and stay productive in society—that already will be a big step. There are ways to improve care even without any new therapies: We have a tremendous opportunity to improve patient recruitment and the conduct of clinical trials and to align, across and within countries, the quality with which care is delivered. Doing this alone will bring drugs faster to market and improve or even save a significant number of patients’ lives. Never miss a story"

November 7, 2017 The importance of place as a determining factor for prosperity in today’s economy has never been clearer. The winning entrants for this year’s Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award and the Bracken Bower Prize are the perfect complements: one about the perils of a General Motors factory shuttering in a small American town, the other about the economic boon that new start-up ecosystems bring as they pop up in locations around the world. 2017’s Business Book of the Year Award went to Amy Goldstein’s Janesville: An American Story , while the Bracken Bower Prize was awarded to Mehran Gul’s The New Geography of Innovation . Dominic Barton, managing director of McKinsey, and Lionel Barber , editor of the Financial Times and chair of the judging panel, presented the awards last night at the Lotte New York Palace in New York City. Barry Diller, chairman and senior executive at IAC and Expedia, gave the ceremony’s keynote address. Janesville is a deeply reported story that raises critical questions about the impact of economic disruption on communities without offering simplistic answers, says Dominic Barton. It is an American story, as the subtitle suggests, but also a truly global one. Janesville is about the new industrial age and how you deal with it. I think it addresses deeply important policy issues, such as skills and retraining. But it’s also a humane portrait of people and their community, says Lionel Barber. Amy, a reporter at the Washington Post , spent years getting to know the Janesville community. After the GM plant closed, many of the typical policy solutions like retraining did not deliver the help that its workers needed. Job retraining, it turned out, was not a path to more work or better pay in and around Janesville, she writes. The judging panel spent Monday deliberating the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. Judges for the award included Lionel Barber, Financial Times editor and chair of the judging panel; Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman at Mozilla; Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz; Herminia Ibarra, professor of organizational behavior at London Business School; Randall Kroszner, professor of economics at University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Dambisa Moyo, global economist and author; Shriti Vadera, chairman of Santander UK; and Rik Kirkland, our head of global publishing at McKinsey. For the fourth time, we presented the Bracken Bower Prize to the best proposal for a business book by an author under 35. This year’s winner was Mehran Gul’s The New Geography of Innovation , which examines the rise of new start-up ecosystems around the world. It beat a record number of entries from 26 countries on topics ranging from technology to gender to the ethics of business. Past winners of the Bracken Bower Prize have gone on to publish books based on their proposals, including 2014 winner Saadia Zahidi , 2015 winners Chris Clearfield and András Tilcsik, and 2015 finalist, Irene Sun . The Business Book of the Year Award is given to the book that provides the most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues, including management, finance, and economics. Since 2005, the prize has shortlisted 77 books that comprise a thorough overview of business in a tumultuous era. Each of this year’s other shortlisted authors will receive £10,000.

Ten years on the consumer decision journey: Where are we today?,"Almost a decade after our initial research on what drives consumer decisions, our experts  wanted to see what has changed in this time.",2017-11-17T04:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Growth, Marketing & Sales",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/ten-years-on-the-consumer-decision-journey-where-are-we-today,"Ten years on the consumer decision journey: Where are we today? From left, Dave Elzinga, a partner, and Bo Finneman, an associate partner, both in the Marketing & Sales Practice, present new insights from the consumer decision journey at ad:tech New York in November. This wraps up a busy fall season of sharing these findings at  events including  Kellogg’s Marketing Leadership Summit in Chicago, the ECI Summit in Barcelona, and Forum McKinsey in São Paulo. November 17, 2017 In the age of digital shopping—where the competitor is a click, swipe, or tap away—how consumers make purchase decisions has radically changed. Marketers have, therefore, become laser-focused on understanding what drives consumer decisions and influencing that journey. McKinsey experts saw this growing need to better understand shifting consumer behavior nearly ten years ago, when we proposed a new approach called the consumer decision journey . It was a significant change in thinking that challenged the long-held concept of the sales funnel, where the decision path narrows in a linear way, from starting with awareness to ending with loyalty. The journey, instead, reflects a more complex reality of shifting choices, decision criteria, and triggers. Today, after almost a decade, we have a database that covers more than 125,000 consumer decision journeys—used to help marketers influence consumers and drive growth—across 350 brands in 30 different industries. So, stepping back, the next big question our experts wanted to answer was how consumer behavior had changed over this time. What did they find? The bad news for brands is, Loyalty is now more elusive than ever, explains Bo Finneman , an associate partner in our Marketing & Sales Practice. Ninety percent of the categories the team studied showed no customer loyalty. And despite the explosion of loyalty programs, engagement in them is dropping. With easy access to information today, consumers feel almost obligated to shop around, says Dave Elzinga, a partner also in our Marketing & Sales Practice. The proliferation of sophisticated sites and technologies has made it much easier for consumers to compare brands. And social media has created greater transparency into what influencers (for example, friends, family, celebrities) are buying and thinking, adds Bo. It’s continuously reminding consumers that multiple choices exist for a purchase, and the choices are constantly evolving, making each purchase cycle feel like new. What I find remarkable is that so many people have more trust in what they read from total strangers than what companies tell them, says Dave. That shows us that brands need to win back the trust of consumers. So what’s the good news? Every purchase is up for grabs today, says Dave. In fact, more than half of customers—58 percent—change brands from one purchase cycle to the next. While this has been seen as a challenge by marketers, it also greatly increases the number of opportunities for a brand to be considered. And getting into the initial consideration set of brands early on in the decision-making process is critical. Nearly 70 percent of brand choices are made at this point—the beginning of the journey—when a consumer is first triggered to shop. What we can see now based on our decision-journey data is the link between early consideration and a brand’s growth, explains Dave. This ultimately led to the creation of a new predictive metric this year—the customer growth indicator —that provides a simple score showing the growth potential of a product. Once a brand knows its growth indicator score, it can easily compare itself to competitors and take effective action. If you’re at the bottom, you’ll want to innovate to make sure you can move up, says Dave. And if you’re at the top, you may need to reinforce your innovation and customer experience as a way of protecting your position. The growth indicator can help brands zero in on which customers to target for early consideration as well as determine how budgets are allocated across various marketing tactics. The key takeaway: brands need to find ways to get into consumers’ consideration early and then continue to stay on the journey with them afterward when they’re triggered to make their next purchase. It used to be that you could win over a consumer and then gain loyalty for the longer term, says Bo. But today, consumers are more enamored with what’s new and continuously top of mind.

Born from the belief that publishing the right kind of articles was an effective way to help executives grapple with managerial challenges, the Quarterly started as a reprint vehicle before soon publishing daily and original pieces of McKinsey’s own insights and research. While much has changed from its early days, its intent to provide unbiased thought leadership to senior business leaders around the world still holds true. In recent years, as the Quarterly ’s content has evolved to keep up with the times so too has the way it’s delivered. We’ve seen that insights can only help our readers if they are packaged in a way that fits into their busy lives. And so we’ve continuously innovated our format—beginning in the late ‘90s with digitizing articles for the web , to growing our social media presence a few decades later (1.5 million LinkedIn followers today), followed by launching our Insights app for mobile, and bringing interviews to life through podcasts . Last month, we introduced the newest iteration of the Quarterly —the Five Fifty . This weekly bite-sized, mobile-first digital briefing covers the business and management issues of the day—in two versions: a highly skimmable five-minute digest or a link to a deeper dive. “To avoid becoming part of the digital noise, we wanted to create something new that would give time-starved readers a useful flash of insight when they are on-the-go, while also serving as a window into more in-depth content,” explains Allen Webb , editor in chief of the Quarterly . “We call it the Five Fifty ,” he adds “because whether you’ve got time for a five-minute skim or a fifty-minute deep dive, you’re going to get a nice return on the attention you invest with us.” Each edition addresses a different management theme, some topical, like digital reinvention , and others evergreen, such as performance evaluations . Lang Davison , executive editor of the Quarterly , curates a blend of proprietary McKinsey insights and relevant, externally sourced content, revealing new angles and interrelationships between them. The Five Fifty was created with the needs of its management audience in mind. Knowing that business readers do a lot of skimming today to get to the crucial content, it offers a shortcut to do just that. While it’s designed to feel engaging and fun, the Five Fifty still brings the same depth of knowledge and rigor for which the Quarterly has been known—for more than half a century. Its focus continues to be on getting our insights into the hands of busy executives with formats that fit their needs. To what extent will they share it? To what extent will they dive into the underlying content in addition to the Five Fifty itself? Time will soon tell. Meanwhile, experience the Five Fifty for yourself here . Never miss a story"
"Welcoming Aberkyn, a firm of change facilitators, to McKinsey","The hardest part of organizational transformations can be the people side of the equation: changing cultures, behaviors and mind sets. 
Aberkyn, a firm of change experts, joins McKinsey this week.",2017-12-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Acquisitions,Organization",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/welcoming-aberkyn-a-firm-of-change-facilitators-to-mckinsey,"Welcoming Aberkyn, a firm of change facilitators, to McKinsey Participants catch up at an Aberkyn community-building event. December 5, 2017 Expanding consciousness. Discovering blind spots. Above-the-line and below-the-line behavior. These are a few of the concepts we’ll be hearing more about as we welcome Aberkyn —a newly acquired firm of 120-plus experts in leadership development and cultural transformation—to McKinsey. They will work side by side with our consultants, helping clients with transformations, including culture change, digital reinventions, mergers and acquisitions, and turnarounds. “Aberkyn will help with the human side of the equation—changing ways of working, mind-sets, and behaviors. This is critical to the success of any transformation . We have always known this and now can scale these capabilities,” says Michiel Kruyt , the Organization Practice partner who co-leads the integration. Aberkyn will retain its unique culture as it becomes part of our global Organization Practice and will work closely with the McKinsey Academy , which offers extensive programs on leadership and team development. Aberkyn will serve clients both independently and in collaboration with  McKinsey. We work in tandem with McKinsey consultants. They will frame the conversation on performance…while Aberkyn counselors draw out the insights on what it will take to change. It’s a very complementary approach… Many of Aberkyn’s facilitators have had ‘hybrid’ careers combining business performance and organizational health. They include entrepreneurs, psychologists, lawyers, and brand executives, as well as McKinsey alumni. All have extensive training in facilitating and coaching transformations. “Helping senior executives become ‘servant’ leaders. Inspiring employees for greater engagement. Leading difficult conversations. Shifting unproductive beliefs. These are the ways Aberkyn practitioners can help inspire change and improve performance,” Michiel explains. “Strategy and analytical thinking are essential—but you cannot analyze your way out of a dysfunctional team or ineffective culture.” Michiel had his own personal experience with transformation. Twenty years ago, as a senior executive, he faced a stress-induced illness. He credits meditation and group therapy with his recovery and with eventually inspiring a career change. “I thought I was pretty self-aware as a leader, but in group therapy I began to learn about my blind spots. With each insight, I felt tremendous relief, and the better I felt, the more effective and influential I became. I got my energy back, and I wanted to help other people find the blind spots that were hindering their performance,” he says. He left corporate life, trained as a group facilitator, and in 2005 joined McKinsey in New York , working with the Organization Practice’s mind-set and behavior group, where he developed a consulting  approach that blended the hard and soft sides of business. In 2008, he moved to McKinsey’s Amsterdam office . He and fellow partner Arne Gast worked together with many of the practitioners who in 2012 went on to found Aberkyn in partnership with McKinsey. … you cannot analyze your way out of a dysfunctional team or ineffective culture “What started as an experiment in Amsterdam has grown to a global community of change-leadership practitioners, trained in a common way, who can offer a seamless approach across the US, UK, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. And we are expanding rapidly in India and China,” says Arne, who is now based in Kuala Lumpur. “For Michiel and me, Aberkyn joining the firm is like coming in a full circle.” Erik Mandersloot , Aberkyn’s managing partner, is leading the integration with Michiel. “One of our strengths is that we meet clients on their ground and don’t come in with a fixed way of thinking,” Erik explains. “We focus on the inside-out transformation of the individual person—often the leaders—as part of the business transformation. “We work in tandem with McKinsey consultants. They will frame the conversation on performance using a fact base, while Aberkyn counselors draw out the insights from participants on what it will take to change. It’s a very complementary approach—one that allows us to get to results more quickly,” he says. Erik walks through a typical engagement. Using tools such as the Organizational Health Index (OHI) , the Team Effectiveness Survey (TTE), and Leadership 360 surveys, Aberkyn facilitators help people understand where they are at the moment—point A—and how they got there. “This can be a difficult conversation because the company is often in transition, sometimes distress,” he points out. “Then we help them imagine the future and identify and model the thinking and behaviors they will need to get to point B. How big is the gap? What needs to change? Then, once there, how do they sustain the change, for both the individual and the organization?” Never miss a story"
¡Bienvenidos a Panamá!  McKinsey opens an office in Central America,"McKinsey opens an office in Panama City, at the crossroads of the Americas and the Caribbean.  The team will focus on banking, digital, engineering and infrastructure, and consumer goods and services work.",2017-12-07T04:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Offices,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/bienvenidos-a-panama-our-first-office-opens-in-central-america,"¡Bienvenidos a Panamá!  McKinsey opens an office in Central America December 7, 2017 Panama is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with well-developed financial-services and logistics sectors. Located on the isthmus linking North and South America, it serves as the geographic and transportation hub of Central America. This month, we are opening an office in Panama City , our first consulting office in Central America. “If you consider Central America as one country, it has the GDP of Argentina—tremendous potential for its size, but split up into seven countries,” notes Julio Giraut ,  originally from Venezuela, who will be the managing partner for the new office. “Through the Panama office, we can more consistently serve clients in broader Central America and in the Caribbean,” he says.  McKinsey has a 20-year history of client work, on and off, in the region. We also have a support center in San Jose, Costa Rica, with some 900+ experts in design, analytics, IT and logistics, among others. Julio relocated with his family to Panama City earlier this year, and since then, he has been a “torero,” or jack of all trades, laying the groundwork: scouting potential office space, getting regulatory approvals, building relationships with local business leaders, and recruiting people to his new team. Initial projects will leverage the team’s expertise in banking, engineering and infrastructure, and consumer goods and services. The Panama City founding team will include 12 consultants and five experts from our Digital Labs . “We want to hire local talent in Panama to become our next generation of consultants—and tap into a growing pool of digital and implementation experts from around the region,” he says. Francisco Gatto , who coleads Digital Labs in the region, says moving to the Panama office was a natural next step given his background: “Prior to joining the firm, my career was built on tech start-ups. I founded my first company while still in college, and the energy of starting and growing something new is embedded in my DNA. Opening a new Digital Labs studio and a new office was an entrepreneurial opportunity I could not resist.” Never miss a story"
Three breakout solutions of 2017,"Three of our solutions experienced breakout growth in 2017 as organizations turned to analytics and technology for talent management, cybersecurity, and to improve patient care.",2017-12-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Solutions,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/three-breakout-solutions-of-2017,"Three breakout solutions of 2017 A quick-service restaurant chain used People Analytics to reshape how it ran its locations,  from the talent profiles it hired to how it organized shifts and work. Performance, including customer satisfaction, improved. December 21, 2017 For more than ten years, our solutions have been a growing part of how McKinsey works with clients. Solutions integrate technology, data and analytics, and proprietary expertise into a more standardized service that can be part of a larger project or directly implemented by clients. Our portfolio today contains more than 85 solutions, and we launch more each year. In this post we look at three that have had exceptional growth in 2017—they reflect some of the most pressing challenges leaders face today. People Analytics This year, organizationally savvy companies have been building their use of analytics to help solve their most important talent-management questions. “ People Analytics have been traditionally used in HR for hiring and retention. But this year, we opened the aperture and began looking across the entire organization at all the points in which teams, behaviors, and mindsets could directly influence business performance,” explains Carla Arellano, senior solution leader. We are seeing clients use data to change daily managerial decisions… The results have been surprising. For example, a quick-service restaurant chain with thousands of outlets found that, contrary to common belief, friendliness was not the most important criteria for hiring frontline staff. Instead, the data showed that servers who were laser-focused multitaskers helped locations deliver better performance, including more satisfied customers. At another organization, we identified patterns in how a sales force collaborated internally with colleagues and externally with clients that were closely linked to better sales performance. “We are seeing clients use data to change daily managerial decisions, from the profiles they hire to the roles they define, how they coach, and how people spend their time,” Carla says. In the past year, with computing advances and the availability of new data sources, from badge swipes and calendaring to Department of Education statistics, we have been able to develop new organizational insights, more quickly. Our team has expanded to include a number of data scientists with organizational, neuroscience, and behavioral backgrounds. Cyber Solutions In 2017, the scale and impact of cyberattacks around the world continued unchecked, with Internet of Things (IoT) environments especially vulnerable. The software for government spy tools was hijacked through insecure Wi-Fi cameras—the most widespread attack to date enabled by IoT. Our cyber team did initial risk assessments and response preparedness for more than 100 organizations, and we saw the nature of our work evolve as we helped clients with fundamental problems. “We helped a health insurer navigate a major data breach and build its cyber response capabilities,” explains Dayne Myers , senior solutions leader. “We’ve worked with a national pension fund to identify high-risk data assets and a state-owned oil and gas company to significantly improve its cyber strategy and organization.” [After] a major hack…it helps immensely to sit down with someone who has managed [this] before. Businesses are also keenly interested in building capabilities, and we have used simulations and gaming techniques to train executives to manage and recover from a variety of incidents. Additionally, we developed a workshop to guide board members in how to think about cyber risks and monitor their companies’ own risk management. The team has deepened its industry expertise as well as experience in a broad range of cyber issues. “When a CEO has just experienced a major hack impacting millions of customers, it helps immensely to sit down with someone who has managed such an incident before,” says Dayne. “In 2018, we will complete the development of solutions that use our latest knowledge work on quantifying data risk and explore applying analytics and AI resources to deepen our cyber risk-insights tools.” Healthcare Analytics And of course, this was a tumultuous year for healthcare policy, especially in the United States. But if there is one goal everyone agrees on, it is better patient outcomes with lower costs. Our Healthcare and Pharma Practices are coordinating to address this goal in a number of ways. We know that for varied reasons, such as hectic work schedules, debilitating side effects, and changing doctors, fewer than half of patients properly take their medications . This issue is the cause of approximately 125,000 deaths each year and $290 billion in wasted medical costs. Even so, many of these are manageable. Using Healthcare Analytics, we are helping organizations to identify patients who are not following their prescriptions and to develop interventions. It starts with the data…Using advanced analytics, we can produce insights down to the individual patient level. “It starts with the data. Our PrimeX solution integrates big data from a myriad of sources—including insurers, clinical data, pharmaceutical data—and combines them with consumer data such as demographics, purchase patterns, and media preferences to build patient profiles,” explains Prashanth Reddy , the partner in our Healthcare Practice who leads PrimeX. “Using advanced analytics, we can produce insights down to the individual patient level.” As part of the solution, the Practice works with clients to build the interventions, as well as more flexibility and better communication flows, into their business processes and technologies. These may include coaching physicians, changing the dosage or application, and improving patient training. The team is also using analytics to identify fraud. By applying machine learning across varied data sets, we can detect the anomalies that indicate fraud, misuse, and waste. Because these algorithms are self-learning tools, they improve in accuracy over time. “In the past year or so, we have doubled our impact on reducing medical costs, embedded pharmaceutical and medical skills on our team, increased efficiency tenfold, and developed many more use cases,” says Prashanth. “Next year, we will explore using digital capabilities for improving adherence and continue to deepen our analytics sets, including through partnerships.” related Our newest solution brings  ‘City Voices’ into government decision making Riding Wave 2 into the digital age Never miss a story"

Build a reef? Save a species?

Save a species? It’s all part of our new digital recruiting Introductory screenshot of scenario-based assessment for recruits January 16, 2018 Imagine yourself in a beautiful, serene forest populated by many kinds of wildlife. As you take in the flora and fauna, you learn about an urgent matter demanding your attention: the animals are quickly succumbing to an unknown illness. It’s up to you to figure out what to do—and then act quickly to protect what you can. In November, 520 recruiting candidates found themselves in just this scenario, on their computer screens. They were at our London testing site immersed in a digital, scenario-based assessment designed to understand and measure how they approach and solve problems—in other words, the type of thinking our own people do every day. As the needs of McKinsey’s clients evolve, our firm is evolving as well, through both acquisitions and organic growth, and we are broadening the types of talent we recruit, including data scientists, implementation practitioners, IT experts, product and digital designers, and software developers. McKinsey’s standard recruiting process involves evaluating résumés, administering a multiple-choice test, and then interviewing select candidates. “But the multiple-choice test has limitations,” explains Keith McNulty , McKinsey’s global director of people analytics and measurement.  “Recruiting only knows if candidates got the right answer, not how they approached the question. Plus, there’s a large amount of strategy, preparation, and luck involved in multiple-choice tests, and if you use them in the selection process, it reinforces the status quo—at a time when you are looking to widen the scope of candidates you’re hiring.” Our firm has deep experience using in-person, scenario-based assessments (such as case interviews) in recruiting. Yet we miss more nuanced perspectives on the skills of some candidates and miss out on other candidates completely because we can’t meet everyone in person. McKinsey began investigating this problem in collaboration with a start-up called Imbellus, which has a team of data scientists, engineers, and psychometricians  who aspire to replace traditional standardized tests and are committed, above all, to science. We also enlisted the help of UCLA’s National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) to help identify and measure the skills we need. The result of this collaboration is a new scenario-based assessment designed to help our firm attract new and different talent profiles from all parts of the world. It not only evaluates candidates in a lower-stress, more engaging environment than a traditional test does but levels the playing field by minimizing the influence of a candidate’s background. It also provides a lot more insight into a person’s skills. When people analytics are applied to the test results of hundreds of recruits—a fast-growing data set—it can not only help determine whether a candidate is creative but also provide an understanding of a deeper subset of skills. How does this person absorb information? Is he or she an idea generator? Does he take an unusual approach to situations? Is she methodical in her analysis—or tend to follow intuition? Can he easily manage multiple factors?  “When people join our firm, we can be more intelligent about placing them in a position—and on a course—that makes sense,”  says Keith. “This approach offers, potentially, hundreds of different readings on a candidate and provides literally an anthology of skills.” What’s next? The team is expanding the pilot to other geographies to collect additional data points before the assessment becomes a formal part of McKinsey’s recruiting practices. Another goal, in the next few years, is to make the assessment available online so we can understand candidates’ skill profiles without bringing them into the office. “This will especially help recruiting in emerging markets,” says Keith.  “As a firm, we’re reinventing ourselves and becoming more diverse to benefit our clients. So if the way we serve clients is constantly evolving, our recruitment processes have to as well.” Meanwhile, back in the forest, more and more animals are exhibiting symptoms, and time is running out. Our candidate chooses a course of action, and the diagnosis is revealed—and so is a way forward for the candidate at McKinsey. Never miss a story"
New book: What big data and behavioral psychology can teach us about business strategy,"Our new strategy book  unites big data analysis with social intelligence–set to a selection of sharp, witty cartoons–for a memorable business read.",2018-01-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our Publishing,Strategy,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-book-what-big-data-and-behavioral-psychology-can-teach-us-about-business-strategy,"New book: What big data and behavioral psychology can teach us about business strategy This cartoon about hockey-stick growth is featured on the cover of the book. January 22, 2018 Strategy books, we’ve read a few. But this one is different. Out in early February, Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick: People, Probabilities and Big Moves to Beat the Odds , a new book by McKinsey experts Chris Bradley, Martin Hirt, and Sven Smit , uses humorous cartoons to tackle the hard questions about setting a course for your business. We sat down with Chris to find out more about this new take on an evergreen subject. Why this book? We wanted to define the modern approach to strategy . Thanks to new technology, we can look at huge data sets about companies’ performance over time and unite that analysis with what we know about how people actually act in the strategy room. It’s more big data, more empiricism, less theorizing. Plus social intelligence, thanks to behavioral economics and psychology. I think we’re naming things that are known but haven’t been named. And now we can have a conversation about what to do about them. Why now? The book was triggered by some research we did about why companies fail or succeed— not according to frameworks or theories but by collecting and analyzing the hard data about companies’ performance over time. We discovered a few things. The first thing we discovered is that only one company in 12 manages to make the leap from middle of the pack to exceptional in a ten-year period. Those aren’t great odds, but what this says to us is that the world of strategy is dynamic enough that you can actually change your position in the market with the right strategy. Our research is motivated by the question: Is there a way to beat those 1-in-12 odds? And what we found out was, yes there is, if you can use the big trends in your industry as tailwinds. The second thing we discovered looking at the data was that bold decisions, big moves, and getting ahead of trends were the things that drove successful strategy. But when my coauthors and I looked at how strategy was actually being practiced, we noticed a big disconnect. The actual practice of strategy tends to have outcomes that are incremental, with a high degree of inertia in resource allocation. So the book was really a product of those two ideas. We think of it as reconciling the bird’s eye view of what’s true and empirical, and the on-the-ground view that’s driven by situational specifics and the social side of strategy. Our book says that there’s another way to do strategy, one that unites what we learned looking at the hard data with what we know about the social side of strategy—and one that will help you make the big moves needed for success and to beat the odds. Tell us more about the social side of strategy. The social side of strategy is all about the interpersonal and organizational dynamics that prevent people from having the hard conversations you need to make the big changes that we know have the best shot at boosting a company’s performance. It’s about how, when we walk to the meeting room, we’ve all got the best of intentions, we all want to have an honest discussion and create a clear view for the future. But when we enter the meeting room, we find that it’s full of people, and people have biases, and internal politics, and competition for resources. Why cartoons? In our book, we found out that cartoons helped us characterize things and draw the truth out more clearly, more easily. We could use humor to connect with our audience, “walk” alongside them, have them look at the system, and laugh at it. And then, we want them to think about what we are going to do about it. We found two very talented cartoonists, Jeremy Banks and Mike Shapiro, and we gave them our manuscript and asked them to respond with cartoons. They generated far more than we ever intended to use, but they were so powerful. We ended up wanting to use all of them. The cartoons are just a great way to build that bridge with our audience and say, “Hey, we’ve all been there before.” Just presenting the data and all those hard-hitting truths could be a little brutal—but you know what they say, “A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.” I personally think the cartoons are really, really funny. They are! The cool thing is, that’s just the cartoonists responding to our manuscript. Any favorites? I think my favorite is the Kodak one. I think it just says so much about that case, and it really brings what we mean about the “inside view” of strategy to life, when people are just trapped in their own view of the world, rather than getting a fresh, outside perspective and taking a hard look at the empirical realities—this is not only required for success, it’s also actually the safest, smartest strategy because it spurs you to action. Market forces are violent for unprepared companies, and the status quo is not safe. The cartoons seemed to poke fun at a certain way of thinking. Would you agree? It was very important to us in writing the book that this was not an academic view of how strategy ought to be, but that it’s a practitioner’s view of what actually happens and the real challenges of creating a company’s strategy. It’s easy to cheat ourselves, with our MBA tools and our frameworks, into thinking we’re doing the right thing. The sharp tone of the cartoons highlights how strategy is about making the right big moves, which you do by building belief and conviction in a team. And if you don’t start with an understanding of the social side of strategy and what sustains inertia inside companies, you’re not going to mount that necessary charge. When the cartoonists first submitted their work to you, was there any revision? How we set it up was, we encouraged them to submit as many cartoons as they could. They ended up giving us 90 cartoons and we used 65 of them. We loved their fresh, creative energy. Jeremy Banks drew the image we used on the cover. He had wanted to go back and touch up it up, but we ended up sticking with the original sketch because we loved its rougher, fresher energy.

Reflections from Davos 2018,"Dominic Barton shares lasting impressions from his ninth, and final, Davos as managing partner. Economic growth dominated the agenda&mdash;along with power politics, social innovation and talent as a CEO priority.

Financial Times Global Business Columnist and Associate Editor Rana Foroohar moderated. January 30, 2018 by Dominic Barton This year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has just concluded—it was my ninth, and last, Davos as managing partner. In a sense, Davos is a window into much of the work we do across the firm—with our clients and on the most significant issues of our time. Six themes we heard: 1. Growth, growth, and more growth – The mood was very upbeat, with a strong consensus that the synchronized economic advance we are seeing around the globe is real. A WEF poll of 1,300 executives captured the bullishness, with 57 percent convinced the economy will improve over the next 12 months—the most upbeat reading since the survey began seven years ago. 2. What could go wrong? – Beneath the prevailing optimism, we heard a number of worries, which I take as a healthy sign and a guard against overexuberance: 3. Power politics – Competing nationalist aspirations were clear as government leaders including the United States, India, Britain, Canada, and Germany, as well as heads of numerous other countries (more than 20 European prime ministers and 10 African heads of state were in town) made pitches for job-creating investment. China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, which could drive investment across Eurasia at a level 12 times that of the post-World War II Marshall Plan, dominated conversations on what will likely be a renewed global push for more and better infrastructure. All this jostling for investment and influence, however, also increased anxiety that the big fear last year—an outbreak of renewed protectionism and trade tensions—could become real in 2018. Davos opened with the announcement of new US tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, mostly from China and South Korea, and concerns about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 4. Get ready for an even more intense wave of corporate transformation – Our conversations with many large and well-performing corporates, from telecom to pharma to banking to energy and more, convinced us that the radical restructuring of portfolios we’ve seen to date is just a prologue. The driver is a quest for new engines of growth. One extreme example was a company that is considering shifting its core business to something entirely new—and at the same time moving its headquarters to a completely new geography. 5. The next innovation imperative will be social innovation – Business’s role will be critical here. As the tech giants are fast learning, low costs and convenience are not sufficient. They were hammered hard at Davos, as they have been in the press, over their market dominance, use of data, privacy policies, and the like. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink summed up the current expectation in his pre-Davos letter to CEOs: “Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose.” Two societal challenges remain unchanged from last year’s WEF: reskilling workers to keep up with technology advances and ensuring that the gains from growth are more widely shared. Adding to these is a need to radically rethink education systems to meet the life-long learning requirements of the 21st century. 6. Talent as a CEO priority – Since I am a coauthor of a soon-to-be-published book, Talent Wins , which draws heavily on the thinking of our Organization Practice , it was heartening to hear how often the critical importance of recruiting, developing, and managing one’s human capital came up this past week. People agreed with our call to engage CEOs on talent, to focus attention on the “critical 2 percent” that drive disproportionate value (and are not always at the top of the org chart), and to deploy talent as thoughtfully as they do capital. Getting this right will be crucial to building enduring institutions that can survive and thrive in turbulent times. And finally, one comment from an Indian CEO that seemed to capture the overall tenor of WEF 2018: “How the mood changes. A year ago, it was doom and gloom. Now the sun is shining. Time to stop talking and start doing.” related Dispatches from Davos Never miss a story"
Behind the scenes of top digital makeovers,Tips from our experts on the ground for a successful digital reinvention.,2018-02-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/behind%20the%20scenes%20of%20top%20digital%20makeovers/digital-team-movie-still_thumb_1536x1536.jpg,Digital,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/behind-the-scenes-of-top-digital-makeovers,"Behind the scenes of top digital makeovers A team bringing agile ways of working to build a company’s new digital unit from scratch February 2, 2018 We use the phrase “digital reinvention” in many ways, but what does it really mean? It can be anything from adding a new digital channel or product line to an existing enterprise to creating a completely new standalone business, and sometimes it is kick-started by acquiring a digital business. “It can be a bit like building a rocket ship while you’re flying it,” laughs Markus Berger-de León , a partner in Berlin who joined McKinsey in 2015 after helming several successful start-ups in Europe. “One of the things I am asked most frequently by clients is about the ‘secret sauce’—what does it take to get a digital transformation right?” says Markus. “When you boil it down, there are really three things that if you get right, you’ve just multiplied your chance of success.” So, what are those three things? “One way to look at it is from the angle of ‘what can go most wrong,’” continues Markus. “And what we find is that if you haven’t built the right operating model or developed the right culture and set of skills for the long -term, it will eventually fail.” Here are some tips from our experts on the ground for a successful digital reinvention. 1. Build a next-generation operating model “There is no one-size-fits-all operating model for every organization,” says Francisco Gatto , a digital expert associate partner in McKinsey’s São Paulo office. Depending on clients’ needs, we will either create a new digital center of excellence in -house or build a digital unit on the side. “The factor that determines which approach we take is how committed the original organization is to a big transformation,” explains Francisco. “If senior executives are not fully supportive, we build something separate, an entirely new business.” One example is a global industrial-manufacturing company that built a digital unit on the side to run a new predictive analytics tool for how they perform maintenance. Prior to that creation, the company had insisted on perfecting solutions before taking them to market, but the cost of delaying was too high in this case. Even when we build a speed boat on the side, we’re always thinking about how to link it back to the ‘mothership.’ “What they needed was a team that could work like a start-up—empowered to take chances and make mistakes,” says Markus. To get there, we worked together to build that type of team with Digital McKinsey colleagues, all from start-up backgrounds in technology. For every McKinsey person brought in, there was a counterpart from the client, working side-by-side with them to learn and exemplify the new way of working. The result? Within a couple of months, the client team was fully independent, equipped to manage the new system. When it comes to introducing a new operating model, “staying close to the parent company,” as Markus puts it, is a point of differentiation for how McKinsey works.  “Even when we build a speed boat on the side, we’re always thinking about how to link it back to the ‘mothership,’” he adds. It is not about creating silos, but rather reinventing the core of a company by making sure the new unit is aligned with the larger corporate strategy and executives’ priorities. 2. Upend the culture “Culture is the most complicated, and often hardest, aspect to change within an organization,” says Francisco. “The ability to experiment with culture without compromising business as usual for the parent company is critical.” This was the case with a Latin American insurance company looking to create an all-digital brand. Within 12 months, a team of agile coaches, designers, and developers from Digital McKinsey—all from start-up backgrounds—built a platform using off-the-shelf components rather than the costly, time-consuming commercial software typically used by insurance companies. “The platform of this new digital brand is a global one that can be used across all branches,” explains Francisco. The implication of this? “Being able to scale this new culture and way of working across the entire bank.” We then helped to recruit, hire, and train 60 full-time, digital-native employees into that insurance company to sustain and continue to build its culture of continuous innovation after the McKinsey team left and the company would be on its own. “If we leave and there’s no team that can continue this way of working, we’ve failed,” says Francisco. During the final weeks with the McKinsey team, our colleagues spent time running operations and contingency plans with the new hires on a practice basis so they would be prepared for all different scenarios. If we leave and there’s no team that can continue this way of working, we’ve failed. “The focus is always on the new unit—and culture— becoming a role model for the rest of the larger organization,” shares Markus. “This means being customer-centric and agile, working in sprints, and focusing on fast learning through experimentation.” 3. Recruit digital-savvy talent A new culture goes hand in hand with luring the right people to an organization. Many large corporations, however, find it difficult to attract digital talent when competing with start-ups and large technology companies. One client shared, “The biggest challenge [in our digital transformation] for us was getting those skills in house—the deep customer and technical know-how.” Often, a separate physical space is used to house the new digital unit, which “can be ideal when there’s a need to hire a lot of new talent while wanting to keep their space and culture distinct from the legacy organization,” explains Francisco. That is exactly what a 150-year-old travel company did when it realized that doing sales via telephone and mailing printed brochures were becoming increasingly outdated, cumbersome, and ineffective. The company had no digital talent of its own, and we helped it set up shop for a new team, initially entirely staffed by McKinsey colleagues, in an abandoned warehouse. In nine months, we brought in a team of 40 people, including designers, engineers, architects, agile coaches, and more, who were able to build and release new digital products, like a redesigned global website for consumers and user-friendly tools for sales to travel agents. In less than one year, the travel company was ready to take control of this new digital unit as well as acclimate its new talent into the organization and implement the broader cultural change. These three elements are critical aspects of every digital transformation we work on. “It’s easy for a large company to start a new business unit or to spin up a new venture,” says Francisco. “What’s hard is scaling that business—winning over customers while also integrating it into the core business strategy.  That’s where the operating model, culture, and new people come in.” To learn more about these principles, visit  our page on digital business building . related This week, VLT Labs joins McKinsey Digital Labs Five things you may not know about Digital McKinsey Never miss a story"
Five athletes give five winning lessons,"With the Winter Games here, we caught up with some of our colleagues and former athletes to hear their stories and the life lessons they&rsquo;ve brought with them to McKinsey.",2018-02-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/five-athletes-give-five-winning-lessons,"Five athletes give five winning lessons February 9, 2018 With all eyes on the Winter Games opening this weekend, it seems like the right moment to catch up with some of our McKinsey colleagues who have competed in the Games themselves. From a 1996 gold-medalist swimmer to several more recent competitors, each took a different lesson from his or her time as an athlete. Kanes Sucharitakul, Sochi,  2014 Hailing from the tropics of Thailand, Kanes Sucharitakul took an unorthodox path in his pursuit of competitive Alpine skiing. Having grown up with avid skiers as parents—his father is half German —he says, “I quickly discovered my love for the sport and the thrill of racing—and winning—from our family ski trips.” By the time he had graduated from university, Kanes was fully invested in getting to the Games, chasing winter wherever he could to compete. Though he didn’t have the speed of his Austrian and Swiss rivals who benefitted from sponsors, professional staff, and decades of knowledge, Kanes was the fastest Thai on the planet. “Coming from a snowless land means you have to build your own training and competition programs,” he explains. The entrepreneurialism it demands, Kanes says, is one of the ways his journey prepared him for consulting life. Another is the ability to quickly adapt to change. In the Sochi Games, Kanes finished 65th in the Giant Slalom, after starting from the 98th position in the start order. Before he even began, the course had become extremely rutted by the passage of the previous 97 skiers; he says, “It was basically a different course from the one the top racers competed on. But you need to perform the best you can in whatever conditions you find yourself.” Kurt Grote, Atlanta, 1996 As a kid, Kurt Grote was not the picture of health, let alone an athlete. Suffering from severe asthma, he spent a lot of time shuttling between his pediatrician’s office and the hospital. At 15, his doctor recommended he try swimming for the therapeutic lung benefits of the surface water’s humidity. So he joined the high-school swim team, showing up for the first practice in board shorts and goggles—which he admits to never having worn before. “I had a lot of catching up to do,” Kurt laughs. By the end of his senior year, he was the fastest sprinter on his team. By his junior year in college at Stanford, he was an NCAA champion, and by a year after graduation he had made it to the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta—taking home the gold medal. How’d he do it? “I realized early on in college I had to create a framework for myself,” smiles Kurt. “It focused on three areas—fitness, technical expertise, and mental toughness.” This meant spending a lot of time in the weight room, watching videos of competitors to learn their craft, and being surrounded by the best swimmers. Now a senior partner in our Healthcare Practice for the past 15 years, Kurt has applied the same analytical approach to his career, having moved methodically from his dream job as a physician to being able to improve patient care across healthcare systems. “While I don’t treat patients at the individual level, now at McKinsey, I’m able to be part of large-scale efforts to really enhance patient care.” Kurt shares an example of a project he worked on with a healthcare provider that resulted in quality-of-life improvement for more than 10,000 people. “We implemented patient screening that ensured patients got the right interventions early on. To me, this is the real dream come true.” Yvette Kong, Rio de Janeiro, 2016 Yvette Kong joined the world of swimming much earlier in life, at 3 years of age, and at 7, she set her sights on making it to the Games one day. Despite years of competing and training nearly 20 hours a week in high school, she missed qualifying twice—first for the 2008 Beijing Games and then again for the 2012 London Games—by just one-tenth of a second. “It was a real heartbreak for me, “she remembers, “followed by a very dark time in my life.” She lost all her desire to swim and decided to take a break to reset her gears. After 2 years, she returned to training again and finally made her dream come true, heading to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Now in her first year at McKinsey as a business analyst, she has lessons of how disciplined thinking and perseverance pay off to bring value to every client project. Aleksa Saponjic, London, 2012 As a bronze medalist in water polo in the 2012 London Games, Aleksa Saponjic , who grew up and trained in Serbia, knows a thing or two about building a thick skin. Accustomed to the “tough communication style” of his coaches, he’s now putting his resilient spirit to the test as a first-year business analyst at McKinsey. “Sports teaches you how to accept losses and focus on ways to improve for the future,” says Aleksa. He reminds himself of this when his analyses or presentations require multiple iterations. “I see my colleagues and clients the same way I saw my coaches—I’m ready to take their feedback and improve for the next time.” Maya DiRado, Rio de Janeiro, 2016 Before even getting to the 2016 Rio Games—let alone winning a gold medal in swimming there— Maya DiRado had decided she would be retiring after these Games. “I always knew swimming wouldn’t last forever and that there’s a hard stop for most people,” she says. Swimming since the age of 6, “the Games weren’t really my focus until a year and a half before I went,” Maya admits. For her, it was more about enjoying the sport without all the pressure. Now in her first year at McKinsey as a business analyst, “I’m reminded of my 6-year-old self—taking in every opportunity to learn as much as I can without getting too bogged down on what’s to come down the line. And that’s when I tend to do my best.” “It feels good to be exercising a different kind of muscle right now,” she smiles. Like many of us across the world, Kanes, Kurt, Yvette, Aleksa, and Maya will be watching the Games and cheering on the athletes. We wish them all the best of luck. Never miss a story"
"A passion for diversity starts early, at home","Vivian Hunt, Managing Partner, UK and Ireland, reflects on the role diversity plays in her life - and why it means so much in the world we all work in today.",2018-02-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-passion-for-diversity-starts-early-at-home,"A passion for diversity starts early, at home Vivian Hunt, Managing Partner UK & Ireland, has shaped McKinsey’s research on inclusion and diversity. She is one of the authors of our new report, Delivering through Diversity. February 20, 2018 We have just published Delivering through diversity , the follow-up to our 2015 seminal report Why diversity matters , which showed that more-diverse companies perform better financially. We sat down with one of the authors, Vivian Hunt, to understand why diversity has been a theme that has so strongly influenced her life and career and why our clients care so much about it. Diversity’s significance in her life started long before Vivian even had the words to describe what “diversity” meant. “My father was in the US Air Force, and we moved for each of his postings. Before I turned 12, we had lived in the deep South, the Northwest, and the heartland of the United States and in Japan. By the time I was 12 we moved to Boston, and I knew the thrill of meeting people and being surprised by the views of different cultures. Discovering the idiosyncrasies that made each person unique and listening to their stories taught me that everyone has a history and different perspective that can add value.” After studying at Harvard and spending time as a midwife with the US Peace Corps in rural Senegal, Vivian arrived at Harvard Business School “convinced that excellence arises from the collective power of diverse minds,” as she states it. “I hoped to be a leader who could bring out the best in diverse talent—with different genders, socioeconomic backgrounds, skills, business experiences—so the group would achieve higher quality outcomes,” she remembers. And she has stayed true to that aspiration. Her more “formal” diversity journey started in 2014, when she and her family had lived in the United Kingdom for nearly 20 years. After becoming the office manager of the firm’s UK and Ireland office, Vivian found that her background was often the first thing that CEOs and other leaders would ask her about. “People were curious and surprised and tended to focus on my inherent traits—such as being an Afro-Caribbean American woman—rather than the strengths I had developed through education and experience,” Vivian explains. “It led to conversations about the importance of intrinsic characteristics versus acquired traits and the value of diversity,” she continues, “but I found that we didn’t have a fact base to point to. The goal of creating this fact base and quantifying the value of diversity was what inspired our research.” ...everyone has a history and different perspective that can add value. Our first report, Why diversity matters , which Vivian coauthored, was an immediate hit. Three years later, it is still one of the firm’s most downloaded reports—it has clearly struck a chord. The report demonstrates that there is a strong positive correlation between diversity in a company’s leadership and its financial performance. “It makes a factual, compelling case that resonates powerfully with our clients, even though the moral argument for pursuing this agenda often comes first. It shows that an inclusive, diverse top team brings a variety of perspectives that results in better decision making, leading to productivity, growth, and improved performance” explains Vivian. The recently published follow-up report, Delivering through diversity , reaffirms the case for diverse and inclusive leadership, with a global data set of more than 1,000 companies, and compares findings across seven industry sectors. “It found that companies in the top quartile for ethnic and cultural diversity on their executive teams were 33 percent more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. Yet ethnic and cultural diversity on executive teams is low. In the United States, black Americans comprise 10 percent of US graduates but hold only 4 percent of senior-executive positions. The patterns are similar for Hispanics, Latinos, and Asian Americans. In the United Kingdom, the disparity is even greater: 22 percent of university students identify as black and minority ethnic, yet they make up only 8 percent of executives in our sample,” explains Sundiatu Dixon-Fyle , an Associate Partner in our London office and coauthor of the report. The latest report also addresses the other half of the “inclusion and diversity” equation—inclusion—and what companies can do to make this agenda work for them. Being invited to the party is one thing, being asked to dance is what really matters: a business might have minorities represented, but companies can only develop their potential if the whole workforce embraces an inclusive mind-set. Easier said than done—for any organization, including our own. But the report profiles extraordinary examples of what works in case studies. Vivian believes that inclusion and flexible working practices are a key differentiator – leaders see the necessity of building an inclusive, nimble organizational culture. The culturally fluent will lead in our increasingly complex, volatile era. They are the ones equipped to bring together colleagues from all backgrounds to reach their full potential and make better decisions – and crucially for our clients, this means increased productivity and improved performance. What will the third Diversity Matters report look at? “A broader, more varied definition of diversity, including variables such as age and socioeconomic background,” says Vivian, as well as “better insights from more powerful analytics and more case studies to expand the global perspective.” Never miss a story"

While the role is quite unlike the CEO of a corporation (individuals are subject to term limits, for example), the managing partner makes key leadership appointments and plays an important part in shaping McKinsey’s overall direction. Earlier today we announced that Kevin Sneader  will succeed Dominic Barton as global managing partner on July 1, when Dominic’s third term comes to an end. A senior partner and McKinsey’s regional chairman for Asia–Pacific, Kevin joined the firm in 1989 from Glasgow University and later gained an MBA from Harvard Business School. He lives in Hong Kong with his wife, Amy, and two daughters. We caught up with Kevin to find out more about what makes him tick. Where did you grow up? I grew up in Glasgow. I was born in Canada because my parents were there for a couple of years. The family joke is that after a couple of Ottawa winters they moved back to Scotland for the weather. What did your parents do? My father was a lecturer at the University of Strathclyde and my mother was a kindergarten teacher. My dad’s field was pharmacy—pharmaceutical chemistry—and his work is quite well known. Some colleagues in our Pharmaceuticals Practice know me as “Dr. Sneader’s son.” How did your background shape your outlook? My upbringing was comfortable, but Scottish academics aren’t tremendously well paid. Travel meant taking the caravan “down South” to England. So I lived in Glasgow, and I went to school and then university there. Today, even though I’ve lived all over the world, my outlook remains rooted in Scotland and Scottish community values. I also developed a passion for Glasgow Celtic Football Club , traveling to away matches with Celtic fans and seeing the world through their eyes. Their lives were very much oriented around the football team. It gave me a sense of what it means to be part of a group that’s passionately committed to something beyond work. What was your first job? My uncle owned a jewelry store. So that was my first job: selling jewelry. I worked there on Saturdays and during school holidays. Why did you join McKinsey? At university I was president of the Student Union, and one of the duties of Student Union board members was to take turns clearing the union bar and the library at closing time. One night I was clearing the library and found a McKinsey recruiting brochure lying on a desk. I’d never even heard of McKinsey, but it looked interesting, so I sent off a letter with my CV. I got a reply saying that while the firm had never hired anyone directly from Glasgow University I was welcome to come down to London to meet a few people. They were managing my expectations! In the end, I had to choose between an offer from McKinsey and a Kennedy Scholarship to study at Harvard. So, I became the first Scottish business analyst in the London office. Literally, I was known as “the Scottish business analyst.” And you never looked back? Well, I turned up at McKinsey with a law degree. I hadn’t done maths in years. I spoke with a strong Glasgow accent. I was lucky to be surrounded by some fantastic colleagues who helped me learn what I needed. What leadership lessons have you learned along the way? I do a lot of work in retail, serving companies with sometimes tens of thousands of employees who can do extraordinary things if they are well led. For me the leaders who stand out are those who know how to motivate and inspire people. They know how to walk the floor of a store and leave everyone feeling better. They also know how to set an inspiring vision. It’s the people skills that set them apart. Is this what you look for in the people you hire? We don’t rely on individuals to solve problems. It’s about putting together teams with different backgrounds and different styles. We look for people who are distinctive at something and will make the firm better for being part of it. On diversity of thought, I think we do quite well. On diversity of gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, we have a lot of work to do. I believe we’ve got to look like the clients we serve and the societies in which we operate. And we’ve got to be relentless about working toward that objective. What’s your plan for the first 100 days? I recently reread an article by Ian Davis [global managing partner, 2003–09] arguing that “the first 100 days” is a somewhat arbitrary and unhelpful framing. I agree with that. McKinsey has been going for a long time, and there are fantastic leaders throughout the partnership. So, I’ll be out there listening and learning. To borrow one of Dominic’s analogies, I will be getting out my searchlight and my spotlight—highlighting things we’re doing well, and looking for opportunities to accelerate things that could be moving faster. What excites you most about the managing partner role? First and foremost, I’m excited about McKinsey! The world is getting more complicated, not less complicated, and the challenges our clients face are getting more difficult, not easier. The value of people who can help crack the world’s toughest problems and create real impact for clients is even more important today than it was in the past. Any time for hobbies and interests outside of family and work? I’m a fairly obsessive sport fan. I love rugby. I’m still obsessed with Glasgow Celtic. When I lived in the US, I even learned to like American football. I love watching sports, and I go to games whenever I can. How do you start your working day? I go to the gym—90 minutes without fail, wherever I am in the world, usually at around 5:30 am. I schedule it into my calendar. I love working out and getting my head around what lies ahead.

Four trends from Mobile World Congress,"Fresh from Mobile World Congress in Barcelona—what four of our experts have to say about the latest trends across artificial intelligence, self-driving taxis, and more.",2018-03-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Digital,AI & Analytics,Telecommunications",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/four-trends-from-mobile-world-congress,"Four trends from Mobile World Congress The McKinsey stand at this year’s Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona where discussed topics included machine learning, digitization, and artificial intelligence March 5, 2018 Robots as coworkers. Autonomous taxis. Hyperreal sports experiences. These were some of the topics at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last week, as some 100,000-plus executives from across the high-tech, telecom, and Internet sectors caught up on some of the themes they heard on the ground this year. During the 4 days, McKinsey hosted a stand, ran workshops, held private meetings with existing and potential clients, and moderated and led panel discussions. We caught up with four of our experts right after their sessions to hear the latest. Artificial intelligence (AI) “We like to call what we're seeing in a lot of companies ‘augmented intelligence’ instead of ‘artificial intelligence,’” smiles Clare. That’s because “it’s not robots replacing humans but rather humans working with machine learning and new processes to make their performance better,” she explains. We see this already happening in a lot of companies—Nokia, one of the session panelists, is a great example. For the past 5 years, much of its factory work has been largely automated. The result—big improvements in quality and throughput with little-to-no layoffs because, while machines are helping with more repetitive tasks, humans still have an important role focusing on more technician-like areas—such as, figuring out what’s gone wrong and fixing it. While much headway has been made in AI , a lot of people still struggle to understand how to make the best use of it in the workforce. “It’s hard to predict where the new jobs will be created, and what they will be, since a lot of change is bound to happen,” says Clare. And while the impact and benefits of AI’s application certainly varies by industry —for example, manufacturing can be a huge benefactor because it relies on predictable physical work well-suited to automation—“early evidence shows it can deliver real value to companies that use it across operations and within their core functions.” Autonomous driving “When it comes to autonomous driving , it’s all about ecosystems of companies and partnerships,” says Kersten. No one has all the capabilities on their own, so collaboration—across tech companies, OEMs, start-ups, mobility players, telcos, suppliers, cities, and others—is key. “In the same vein, the panelists shared that no one player is really going to set the safety standards within the space, so flexible cooperation will be needed,” he adds. As for upcoming trends, OEMs, tech players, and suppliers are developing their own concepts in shared autonomous vehicles—the robotaxis and roboshuttles for both passengers and goods. “They’re heavily investing in both tech and in building up their user base,” says Kersten. Additionally, these players are feeling confident about their likelihood of being successful in the electric-car space. “Everyone stands a chance to win here.” Globalization of sports As more consumers sever ties with traditional cable companies, sports brands are looking for new ways to reach and engage fans. Like Amazon and Netflix, they’re going direct-to-consumer by launching their own video subscription services that bypass TV players. “Up until just a few years ago, these video-streaming apps were seen as digital add-ons to their main business,” says Tom. “It’s inspiring to hear from such big brands at Mobile World Congress today how transformative the shift really is.” “Successful sports brands are realizing they need to bring the entire sports-viewing experience to life,” says Tom. This goes beyond just watching the game—with innovations like sensors on car engines to enhance the audio or cameras on referees to give fans a player’s-eye-view. In response to this, companies are bringing in new kinds of talent and backgrounds—like advanced analytics and digitization—into their organizations along with agile ways of working. “Gone are the days of measuring change in weeks or months,” says Tom. “Today, it’s about reacting in days, if not hours, to keep pace with consumers’ changing demands.” Network functions virtualization (NFV) For the non-tech reader, Network Functions Virtualization is a new virtual way to design, deploy and manage networking services instead of using physical hardware. “This session reinforced that momentum is picking up for this type of technology,” says Martin. “We’re seeing more readily available and pressure-tested vendor solutions in this space, giving operators the confidence to try it.” While a few years ago operators were focused on capital-expenditure savings, now they are realizing that virtualization is a way to transform the processes that run within a network—such as the automation of engineering and operations tasks, setting up agile ways of working, and having software engineering and development work closely together. “Aside from the big telecom players, newer and smaller ones are starting to push the pace,” says Martin. During the session, the CTO of Boingo shared that more than 80 percent of its core network is already virtualized, allowing for greater flexibility to accommodate the volatility in service usage. “Those that view this technology as an enabler to driving their transformations will be the winners in the end,” says Martin. related Gene therapy for telecom operators: An interview with Jon Fredrik Baksaas Picking up signals at Mobile World Congress Never miss a story"
"At Summit, 150 leaders seek a longer horizon","At a recent Summit, 150 leaders focused on priorities for strengthening long-termism in business and investing—from shareholder communications to investment mandates.",2018-03-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Long-termism,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/at-summit-150-leaders-seek-a-longer-horizon,"At Summit, 150 leaders seek a longer horizon Dominic Barton, McKinsey’s managing partner, and Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, chatting before panel on managing activist shareholders. March 8, 2018 The view was stunning: a sunlit vista across Manhattan’s Central Park. But participants at last week’s Focusing Capital on the Long Term  (FCLT) Summit were concerned with horizons measured in decades, not miles. One hundred and fifty  CEOs, chief investment officers, policy makers, and experts converged on New York to discuss ways to nurture long-term thinking and investing in a business–financial system seemingly obsessed with the near term. The first order of the day? A pop quiz by Nitin Nohria, dean of the Harvard Business School, and Harvard professor George Serafeim. The questions came quickly. What is the percentage of US equities in index funds? What is the average duration of  CEO compensation? What’s the average turnover of S&P companies over 50 years? The answers, scored electronically, revealed gaps in the group’s perceptions—and the reality—of long-term investment behavior. The message? When we live in a world where facts can have a ‘‘suspect level of accuracy,” it’s critical to seek out the truth—and accurate research. This is where FCLTGlobal, the independent nonprofit that sponsored the Summit, comes in. Long-termism is one of McKinsey’s enduring values, underpinning our  work on organizational health and social responsibility. In 2011, our managing director, Dominic Barton, started laying the groundwork for this initiative, leading research and publishing reports in both Harvard Business Review and McKinsey’s own publications . To carry on this work, in 2016 McKinsey helped establish FCLTGlobal , led by McKinsey alum Sarah Williamson , who came to the organization with over 25 years of investment-banking and asset-management experience. In the past 18 months, membership has doubled, from 18 to 42 global asset owners, managers, and corporations. The organization has published research that has been discussed in the international investment community, as well as the UK Parliament, the US Congress, and the media. “The next step is taking ownership of the issue and creating practical antidotes to short-termism. Short-term pressures come from many points along the investment value chain, and lasting change can be driven effectively by asset owners, asset managers, and corporations,” Sarah said. “There are significant costs to society when overwhelming pressure for near-term results drowns out long-term aspirations. We’re trying to reverse that.” Two of the morning sessions pressure-tested FCLT’s thinking on investment mandates and moving beyond short-term guidance . “We wanted to bring representatives of companies, asset managers, and asset owners to the same table—which does not happen often—and give them an opportunity to talk candidly with their peers,” explained Mark Wiseman , FCLTGlobal’s board chair. In a CEO panel moderated by Dominic Barton, the chief executives of BlackRock, Dow, Unilever, and CDPQ—Larry Fink, Andrew Liveris, Paul Polman, and Michael Sabia,  respectively—talked about the challenges of maintaining the long-term focus and integrity of organizations while facing the intense, disruptive pressures of short-term activists. Tim Koller , a McKinsey partner and coauthor of Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies , the industry standard on determining the value of business organizations, attended the Summit. He sees progress. “It’s gone beyond just talk about long-termism—especially with very large investors, such as BlackRock, investing in substantial staff and resources to evaluate and make voting decisions about companies, including companies in their index funds, which have a long-investment horizon,” he said. “Index funds, in total, represent about 20 percent of the market today and are growing.” One priority for guidance is the long-term board. “There is much research to do in this area: what the makeup of the board should be, priorities, time spent, compensation,” says Mark. “We started early work by visiting some family businesses that have lasted several generations. In one of them, people talked about the ‘Zoe factor’—Zoe was a grandchild—and what the company would look like in her era. We want to ensure we capture that type of mind-set and content.” CEO evaluation is also important, according to Tim. A board should understand, in depth, a CEO’s strategic decisions, whether they have built a good management team, and what kind of culture they are encouraging. “They should be evaluated on decisions they make—not just in the short term but also on those that will be affecting the company long after they’ve gone,” says Tim. “We have more to do,” notes Mark. “We raised the alarm, delivered the message, and now it’s time to develop practical solutions.”  The next FCLT Summit is set for 2020—for those with a long-term mindset, it’ll be here in the blink of an eye. related A report from the Long-Term Value Summit Never miss a story"
Digital 20/20: Helping companies set the stage for their digital future,"Drawing on a decade&rsquo;s worth of collected data across various organizations, we&rsquo;ve launched our latest assessment of a company&rsquo;s digital and analytics opportunity—Digital 20/20.",2018-03-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Digital,Solutions",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/digital-2020-helping-companies-set-the-stage-for-their-digital-future,"Digital 20/20: Helping companies set the stage for their digital future A performing-arts organization used Digital 20/20 to widen its viewership from a single stage to a global audience without changing its physical space. March 16, 2018 How does a performing-arts organization expand its audience without changing its physical space? What is the best way for a bank to streamline its digital acquisitions across 20 countries? How should an online gaming company use web analytics to increase sales? These are some of the questions that Digital 20/20, now known as Ignite , is helping to answer. “Digital 20/20 takes McKinsey’s most effective diagnostic assessments on digital and analytics and integrates them into one single solution, giving C-level executives a holistic view of their company’s digital opportunity,” explains Matt Brown , global solution leader. “Having worked with 700-plus companies over the last three years, we’ve seen many invest significantly in digital and analytics initiatives without getting the hoped-for ROI,” says Matt. “Often times, they approach their transformation with little understanding of which areas to focus on.” Insights from our current assessment tools—such as Digital Quotient , Analytics Quotient , and Agile 360 —show that only 15 percent of companies have fully integrated analytics into their business processes, and many  CEOs are struggling to deliver on a digital strategy. “And so we asked ourselves, ‘How can we give clients a better big-picture view of where their digital opportunity lies?’” recalls Matt. Developed as one integrated online survey, Digital 20/20 assesses an organization’s digital and analytics capabilities across six critical functions—from strategy to technology to culture—and benchmarks them against peers and best practices. “We then deliver a report that includes an overall capability score, a detailed explanation of best practices, and a list of the prioritized initiatives needed for a digital transformation,” explains Björn Münstermann , a partner of Digital McKinsey . The solution draws on a decade’s worth of collected data. “This is coupled with on-the-ground walkthroughs and/or workshops,” he adds. The idea for Digital 20/20 grew out of on-the-ground research that we conducted over two years. We interviewed 100-plus thought leaders across the top digital companies worldwide—including digital natives Amazon, eBay, and Google, as well as legacy companies, to learn what their magic formula was. “High-performing digital winners are orchestrating their strategy across the entire organization,” explains Tanguy Catlin , a senior partner. “They’re not just looking at one department but rather ensuring there’s integration across several critical ones, like strategy, analytics, technology, marketing, organization, and operations.” High-performing digital winners are orchestrating their strategy across the entire organization. At the same time, the team looked at how different advisory firms were providing digital strategy to companies.  “You’d see a software systems integrator come in with a set of interventions focused solely on tech, or market-research firms providing benchmark data on IT cost with little insight into overall business performance. It was very fragmented,” says Matt. “We wanted our clients to see the whole picture of their organization but realized our current offerings were fragmented too—that was the aha moment that led to the creation of Digital 20/20.” “It allows us to offer clients a streamlined view across the entire organization, with the ability to drill down and identify granular-level opportunities in specific business and functional areas,” explains Tanguy. When it came to the performing-arts organization mentioned earlier, we did just that. Insights from Digital 20/20 focused on bridging its physical and digital functions, developing partnerships with external tech players, and building digital capabilities in data analytics. Within a single year, a series of concert webcasts launched, reaching over 150 countries and racking up nearly 3 million views. We wanted our clients to see the whole picture of their organization—that was the aha moment that led to Digital 20/20. “You can’t really succeed in a digital transformation by just, say, assessing a company’s talent without ensuring that the right IT infrastructure is in place or that agile methods align with business objectives,” states Matt. “Marketing has to talk to IT, which needs to talk to Strategy, which needs to align with Organization, and so on.” The bank, referenced above, hit the nail on the head by developing a set of global key performance indicators and dashboard standards for its acquisitions across 20-plus markets. The result—$700 million captured in annual revenue within 18 months. As for what’s next for Digital 20/20, the goal is to offer it as a self-serve model with on-demand features. “We want to empower clients to easily log onto the platform and get the needed assessment at the click of a button,” says Matt. “They'll be able to continuously get support with planning, tracking, and executing their digital aspirations.” Never miss a story"
A vision of beauty: How we helped Chile to create ten million acres of stunning national parklands,A team of consultants provided pro bono support to Tompkins Conservation to help make the economic case for Chile&rsquo;s new national parks.,2018-03-27T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20vision%20of%20beauty%20how%20we%20helped%20chile%20to%20create%20ten%20million%20acres%20of%20stunning%20national%20parklands/blog-chile-nationalparks-thumb.jpg,"Social Impact,Sustainability,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-vision-of-beauty-how-we-helped-chile-to-create-ten-million-acres-of-stunning-national-parklands,"A vision of beauty: How we helped Chile to create ten million acres of stunning national parklands March 27, 2018 A morning breeze blows through the grasslands of the new Patagonia National Park, in Chile, where southern beech forests frame the towering Andes mountains and condors circle high above. The park’s varied ecosystems—including grasslands, riparian forests, and wetlands—provide habitats for hundreds of plant and animal species, including armadillos, foxes, guanacos, and pumas. In late January, this was the setting for a ceremony where Kristine (Kris) McDivitt Tompkins, president of Tompkins Conservation , and Chile’s president Michelle Bachelet signed decrees that will add ten million acres—comparable in size to Switzerland—of new national parklands in Chile. They include one million acres of land from Tompkins Conservation—considered history’s largest donation of land from a private entity to a country—as well as an additional nine million from Chile. The new national parks will expand Chile’s national parklands by nearly 40 percent. They will serve as the cornerstones of the Route of Parks, an unparalleled network of 17 national parks that will span 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) of scenic highway across the country’s pristine wilderness. The Route of Parks, or the “Ruta,” was the vision of Doug and Kris Tompkins, conservationists and former business leaders. A team of three McKinsey colleagues—based in Chile and San Francisco, passionate about conservation, and inspired by the Tompkins vision—worked with Kris and the Tompkins Conservation team, providing pro bono support to develop an economic model ensuring that the parks would be sustainable. “We looked at the economic-development potential that this amazing ecological and conservation opportunity presents for Chile,” explains Tony Hansen , director of McKinsey’s Global Infrastructure Initiative, who led the project. “Our analysis suggested that ‘ecotourism’ could create more than 43,000 jobs and generate a boost of around $270 million to the economy in the regions surrounding the parks over the next ten years.” Aparna  Singh and Francisco Faine worked alongside Tony on the study, drawing specialist input from McKinsey and other global experts. “As a Chilean, it has been very exciting to see the great influence that this project has had across the world and the visibility it gave my country,” explains Francisco. “I believe the Ruta will contribute to the development of the south of Chile and be a legacy for future generations.” Tompkins Conservation was founded by Kris and Doug Tompkins, business leaders behind iconic US clothing brands such as Esprit, The North Face, and Patagonia. In the 1990s, they changed the trajectory of their lives when they began their conservation work in Chile and Argentina, devoting their funds, time, and passion to fight what they saw as the world’s biggest crisis: the loss of biodiversity. “National parks represent the ‘gold standard’ of biodiversity conservation,” says Kris. “They offer a unique set of ecological attributes, cultural values, and economic benefits to local communities, while also guaranteeing long-term conservation.” Kris and Doug purchased, restored, and conserved over two million acres of land in Argentina and Chile over the past 25 years. Doug, who died tragically in a kayaking accident in December 2015, saw the Ruta as a way to support conservation, promote ecotourism, and ensure economic development—the blessings of conservation on an unprecedented scale. If anything can save the world, I would put my money on beauty. The team is now looking at how public and private institutions can work together to secure sustainable financing so that the parks are protected for the long term and realize their economic potential. For Tony, the collaboration with Tompkins Conservation was an opportunity to bring together his professional expertise and his deep personal connection to the wilderness of southern Chile. He first visited Patagonia with his kayak, paraglider, and ski-mountaineering gear in 1991 and has returned more than a dozen times since. “It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to contribute to the creation of such a huge area of new national parks in one of the most beautiful countries on Earth,” Tony says. “As Doug Tompkins himself was quoted saying, ‘If anything can save the world, I would put my money on beauty.’” Find out more about opportunities for making an impact .

Lasting change: Our implementation consultants help make it happen,"With the observation skills of an anthropologist, the intuition of a coach and deep industry expertise, our implementation consultants work side-by-side with our clients to transform their work.",2018-04-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/lasting%20change/blog-implementation-thumb_758302441_1536x1536.jpg,Capability Building,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/lasting-change-our-implementation-consultants-help-make-it-happen,"Lasting change: Our implementation consultants help make it happen From the boardroom to the assembly line, our implementation consultants work shoulder-to-shoulder with clients, helping them stay on course. April 3, 2018 With the observation skills of an anthropologist, the intuition of a coach and deep industry expertise, our implementation consultants work side-by-side with our clients to make change happen. They take the time to establish the routines and rhythms that institutionalize new plans and processes. They build skills and help clients visualize and create the future. In this post, three of our Implementation colleagues reflect on what inspires them about the work they do and the relationships they develop. From the boardroom to the shop floor, assembly line, or operating room, change at work is hard and everyone at all levels of an organization needs to get on board to make a course change successful. This is what McKinsey Implementation is all about. Mandy van de Velde , an implementation coach based in Amsterdam, describes how a typical day reflects that purpose. On a project at a hospital, “I scrubbed in with the operating-room cleaners to understand how they did their job, studying the process of how the rooms would be sterilized and set up for the next procedure. Then, later the same day, I was meeting the hospital management for a coaching session in a boardroom. Those sorts of days—going from wildly different groups in a company—are my favorite.” Implementation consultants are part of McKinsey client teams from day one. Present during the diagnostic and recommendation phase of projects, they continue to work alongside with clients to execute the implementation phase, staying on site for 12 months or as long as is needed. They build an organization’s leadership, implementation, and functional capabilities to achieve long-term results by working side-by-side with people at every level of a client’s organization. I scrubbed in with the operating-room cleaners to understand how they did their job, studying the process of how the rooms would be sterilized and set up for the next procedure. Created in 2010, McKinsey Implementation now has more than 800 dedicated consultants at 18 hubs across the globe. Implementation consultants often join McKinsey with significant working experience in an industry—and they include experts in mining, marketing, consumer products, pulp and paper, and healthcare, to name a few. “My pre-McKinsey experience helps me tremendously in practically all the projects that I work on,” explains Katalin Miskolci , a senior implementation leader based in Budapest. A former computer engineer at Nokia, she also led a shared-service center in eastern Europe for IBM before joining the firm. She shepherded the center through years of rapid growth, from being its first employee to leading over a thousand people; expanding the scope of services, driving continuous improvement, end-to-end functional integrations, and automation programs. “It’s the story that you bring. I can easily see myself in my clients’ shoes, because I have been there myself. I think they sense this about me.” Blake Lindsay , a senior implementation leader based in Denver, was an officer aboard a US Navy aircraft carrier before joining the firm. The skills instilled in him in the military, including team work and the ability to stay calm under pressure, directly translated to his work as an implementation consultant. “Coaching has taken many forms during my projects. When I started, I coached frontline supervisors to meet performance targets and to find the new muscles you have to flex in order to achieve these new goals, whether it’s learning how to be more collaborative or improving productivity or adapting to new technologies,” he explained. “It’s a matter of focusing on new skills.” Implementation consultants’ observations are part of determining this focus. Like an anthropologist, a consultant studies whatever form the work happens to take, such as processes on the shop floor, down to the smallest details. As Mandy explains, “we don’t try to patrol workers, we try to understand how they are working and coach them on how they can do it more efficiently.” I can easily see myself in my clients’ shoes, because I have been there myself. I think they sense this about me. Implementation consultants also love the long engagement. They are with clients for months, sometimes years, working in close quarters and developing close bonds with them. “It’s important to me to stay in touch even after the McKinsey part of the effort is done. Recently, after we completed a transformation project, I was invited to a celebration of the one-year anniversary of their launch. It was gratifying for me to see that they have continued along the journey so successfully,” recounted Katalin. Our implementation colleagues stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their clients to make sure they stay on course, even if that course shifts. Blake remembers a long engagement with a large manufacturing client during a market crash which forced them to adapt their transformation plan quickly. “We now had to help the client push through a difficult time while at the same time keeping the momentum for our original plan. We had to make sure that they felt like they owned the solution and sustained the changes they set out for themselves. Long story short, it was a challenging situation, but by working together, we helped our client to adapt the plan and create a sustainable solution to continue the transformation.” In every project, there’s apprehension about change. “We train our clients to expect that,” says Mandy. When clients learn a new skill or process, “there’s a predictable emotional curve, where at first they are all the way at the bottom of the curve, not really trusting the change or thinking, 'okay, well, it's new so let's see what happens.’” With our support, they go up in the curve because they’re getting the hang of it. But over time, there are more things to change, more re-skilling that needs to happen, and “they usually go down again because now they feel like too much is changing or 'I don’t know how to change or maybe I'm not doing it the right way.' And then a week or two weeks later when they have gone through that low curve they can go up again when they really see that things are sticking.” The emotional curve affects everyone, from frontline workers up to the CEO. There’s no magic to moving up the curve. But the process of overcoming the challenges and insecurities that arise is an opportunity to build confidence and skills—and it’s easier if you have an implementation expert at your side.

McKinsey&rsquo;s Organizational Agility Forum: Where stability meets change,"In our recent two-day workshop, we worked with executives to help them envision what enterprise agility looks like for their companies.",2018-04-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Organization,Capability Building",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinseys-organizational-agility-forum-where-stability-meets-change,"McKinsey’s Organizational Agility Forum: Where stability meets change In one exercise, participants choose two pictures from a collection—one that reflects where their organization currently is and another for where they want it to be. April 26, 2018 Last month, 50-plus senior executives and McKinsey partners from consumer goods, healthcare, banking, and more gathered in our New York Experience Studio for our 15th Organizational Agility Forum . Since starting just two years ago, this two-day workshop has helped over 200 senior leaders across all industries and 20 countries develop practical plans to help their own organizations become more flexible and highly functioning amid the constant market disruptions today. One team at the forum, from a global investment-management firm, had already piloted agile processes across 3,000 of its employees and now wanted guidance on next steps: how to scale up across the enterprise and to adapt its infrastructure. Another team from an automotive company was just starting out, using the workshop to define a future agile organizational model that it could take back to its board. McKinsey experts help executives envision what enterprise agility actually looks like for their companies and start a plan.  “This can be anything from a roadmap on how to create small, autonomous teams to drafting their ‘change story’ for an employee’s town hall,” says Steven Aronowitz , a partner in the Organization Practice . “We then get very tactical, walking through specific journeys of companies that have become agile—what they did—and continue to do—to sustain that,” adds Steven. The ability to adapt boils down to organizational design, an area McKinsey has been immersed in for decades, and, increasingly, their level of enterprise agility . “To keep up, many companies are reorganizing more frequently— every two years , on average—and those that do it well are thriving,” says Wouter Aghina , a partner in our Organization Practice. “Agile is about looking holistically across the people, processes, structure, strategy, and technology and stripping away the bureaucracy and layers of hierarchy to move more quickly,” says Allan Jaenicke , an expert associate principal.  “Empowering people to make decisions regardless of title or rank and using technology as a way to share ideas is what works more effectively.” “Ultimately, it’s about achieving this paradox of stability and dynamism ,” said Michael Lurie , a senior expert in agile transformations,  during one of the forum exercises. Looks of puzzlement filled the room. “That feels counterintuitive to me,” said one client from a pharma company while others nodded in agreement. How can you be both nimble and fast moving—like, say, a start-up—in a bureaucratic organization? That’s a good question. As an analogy, Michael used Steve Jobs’s consistent outfit: a black turtleneck and blue jeans. Jobs, Michael explained, “didn’t have to devote any headspace to what were extraneous tasks to him—like his clothing. Instead, he could pool all his energy into creating world-changing technology.” For companies today, this means deciding which aspects of work can be kept stable, such as a shared vision and purpose, to free up space for dynamism in other areas. “It’s hard to know which areas to focus on at first,” says Monica Murarka , a senior knowledge manager. “Most organizations start transforming by doing pilots with their customer-facing units—innovation, customer experience, sales and servicing, and product management—but just as important is having a performance-based culture void of judgment and fear of failure.” She adds, “Without this, it’s very difficult to scale beyond pilots.” Ideas about enterprise agility extend beyond the teachings of these workshops. “We’re continuously reinventing the forum itself, based on feedback and by applying insights from our own client work,” says Wouter. The forums—invitation-only events for senior executives—are held around the world throughout the year. To learn more about it, get in touch with us here . Never miss a story"
Design dispatches: McKinsey at Milan Design Week,A delegation from McKinsey Design attends the largest design fair in the world. Here&rsquo;s what they saw.,2018-05-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Design,Europe",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/design-dispatches-mckinsey-at-milan-design-week,"Design dispatches: McKinsey at Milan Design Week Mark Dziersk, LUNAR industrial design leader, speaking about the future of the connected home at Milan Design Week. May 2, 2018 Guest story by Mark Dziersk, LUNAR industrial design leader Every year, thousands of designers gather for Milan Design Week, held in the city where some would argue the first industrial designer, Leonardo Da Vinci, did his finest work. Known in Italian as Salone del Mobile di Milano , it’s the largest trade fair of its kind, showcasing the latest cutting-edge products in furniture and design. We were speaking at the event and McKinsey Design sent a delegation of designers there for the week. Here’s what we saw and heard… Over the past few years, McKinsey Design has created a worldwide network of design studios, thanks in part to the acquisition of award-winning design firms like LUNAR and Veryday. We are bringing design thinking into all kinds of work to better serve our clients across all sectors, whether it’s creating a new product, travel experience or better ways of serving customers or citizens. We attend events like this one to learn, be inspired, and connect with our wider design community. Our delegation was comprised of two designers from our Stockholm studio, Bryce Booth and Yui Komatsu , and two from our San Francisco studio, Lea Kobeli and Mihoko Ouchi . I was privileged to speak at the Design in the Age of Experience event.  My talk on Friday, titled “Dwelling in a sustainable world,” was about the future of the connected home, and it told the story of the work LUNAR did for ecobee in 2014, a Toronto-based smart-technology company. At the time, this connected device was the most sensitive thermostat yet, providing the most control of your home environment with individual room sensors. After the presentation, the next two speakers and I sat for a panel and took questions from the audience. The conversation was lively, as we debated just how smart we really want our Internet of Things devices to be, and how disappointed we become when they are not smart enough. The scale of the fair is enormous. Spread across multiple venues, this year’s show occupied an area of nearly 230,000 square meters and included 2,500 companies, along with 700 young designers at the SaloneSatellite , a secondary exhibit. Some 350,000 people visited this year, with attendees flying in from more than 150 countries worldwide to see the latest and greatest in design, materials finishes, lighting, and computer technology. As LUNAR’s creative director Lea notes, it’s not just the sheer size of the fair and number of attendees but also the sense of community that spontaneously arises. “As a first timer, I was blown away by the sense of design oozing out of every corner in Milan, and the flocks of people from all over the globe experiencing design collectively, in the sunny and warm streets, bumping into old friends and coworkers, sharing stories, and ending up at Bar Basso, the design community’s meeting place.” A huge highlight of the fair is its various pavilions, where companies frequently showcase interactive installations in addition to their latest designs. “Companies are shifting from selling products to selling experiences. This was evident in exhibits by fashion, automotive and electronics brands, in which experience was paramount and products took a back seat—or were absent all together,” Bryce noticed. Mihoko agrees, and says that thanks to a focus on experiences, “For each of us, Milan Design Week is a highly personal and emotional experience. It was gentle, like storytelling to children—full of imagination and discovery.” Lea was especially inspired by the installations where the focus is as much on the process as the end result. “They take us on a journey; we entered a series of black rooms, where relaxing sounds and smoke let us focus on what is exhibited in front of us.” This stood in contrast to many exhibits that focused more on trendy, immersive, and Instagram-able selfie spaces. “It’s refreshing to see the experimental qualities of all the explorations, since it’s the process of discovery that leads to the aha moment, instead of the instant gratification we are all getting attached to with one-touch services,” Lea says. The Dassault Systèmes pavilion in the heart of the fair explored the idea of nurturing the environment. Japanese artist Kengo Kuma’s “Breath/ng,” an enormous, spiraling, and air-purifying installation, anchored the space. This spectacular architectural work made from pollution-neutralizing materials filters the air as it spirals. Environmental issues were a recurring theme throughout the show, as were the many uses of “smart”—whether it was smart lighting that danced in time with a piano or smart new electric cars. It was fascinating to see the diverse approaches designers are taking in the next generation of smart products. We left the fair inspired. As Lea put it, “Seeing the vast creativity and constant reinvention of the current status quo exhorts us to do the same re-imagining and reinvention in our own work—and leave fear and hesitation by the wayside.” I wholeheartedly agree. Here’s to exploring, pushing boundaries, and discovering all the possibilities. Never miss a story"
MineSpans: A story about data…and mining,"Everything you want to know about copper, gold, zinc—and more—can be found in one solution: MineSpans. Meet the people—a gemologist, biologist, mining and data experts—who create the analytics and insights that help mining execs make critical decisions.",2018-05-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Solutions,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/minespans-a-story-about-data-and-mining,"MineSpans: A story about data…and mining A haul truck driving up a gold mine in Australia. Gold is one of the commodities covered by the MineSpans solution. May 8, 2018 A biologist who worked in a brewery. A gemologist. A salt-mine engineer. What do these three people have in common? They’re on the team behind McKinsey’s MineSpans solution. They collect and analyze data to build cost curves and supply and demand models, and provide key insights for mining companies and financial institutions around the world. The MineSpans data covers 3,700 individual mining operations, with 100 to 150 data points per mine, and draws from 85 years of industry expertise .  The data provide users with the reliable information they need to make strategic decisions. “Our clients can use MineSpans to understand where global commodity prices could potentially move and how costs should evolve, where new supply is coming from; the economics of specific projects, the role of China in the market, and how the industry cost structure will evolve across mines, competitors and commodities,” explains Eduardo Mencarini , the solution leader who is based in our Brussels Innovation Center. In addition to the solution’s baseline scenarios, users can apply their own assumptions on, for example, exchange rates and factor prices—and see the effects on the cash flows and individual assets, as well as develop personalized supply, demand and cost curves. In less than two years, the solution has grown from one copper curve to a portfolio of six commodities. This quarter, it will add one more—cobalt, which has seen exponential growth in demand for use in electric-vehicle (EV) batteries. For the same reason, demand for nickel and lithium are also expected to boom up to and beyond 2025—a powerful force reshaping the mining landscape. “Our team has looked at the ways that additional supply, recycling, and new battery-technology development could work together to rebalance this surge in demand—and temper possible shortages,” says Eduardo. The idea for MineSpans can be traced back 5 years ago—to three colleagues from the Basic Materials Practice and one partner with a vision. “At that point, we were buying mining data from other companies, but we believed – backed by our senior partner Sigurd Mareels  – that we could create a more reliable service ourselves—with data that were more accurate, flexible, and transparent,” remembers Friso De Clercq , who heads up data management for the solution. Liesbet Grégoir and Patricia Bingoto, rounded out the team back then. Developing the solution was a labor of love, carried out alongside their regular jobs. “We welcomed any help we could get in gathering, cleaning, and sorting the data into numerous spreadsheets and then merging them,” recalls Diederick Roodt , who started his career in the coal mines of South Africa. What they got that first year was a rotating team of 25 summer interns hailing from a wide variety of backgrounds including medicine, law, and business. By 2015, the multidisciplinary team built its first copper cost curve and supply outlook—and soon asked for the funding to turn MineSpans into a full-fledged product. Today, the growing team includes data researchers and IT, analytics, modeling, and metals-and-mining experts. The range of commodities MineSpans covers has evolved with the team and now includes copper, iron ore, gold, potash, zinc and uranium. Cobalt is next, while lithium, nickel, aluminum and coal are also on the radar. The people working on these commodities are as diverse as the commodities themselves. Friso completed a PhD on tin and tungsten in Rwanda before joining the Basic Materials Institute as a researcher. Liesbet is a master in geology with deep expertise in iron ore and steel, potash, cost modeling, strategy and pricing. Tom Voet, the brewery biologist, joined as a student intern and now works on iron ore. Pawel Kalka, who is responsible for advanced analytics in Poland, previously worked in a quarry and salt mine. Diederick Roodt traded in his hard hat and cap lamp for crunching copper data and leading data management with Friso. Dawid Lipus, an oil and gas engineer by training, leads the gold-supply and cost-data team, while Tom Thys, a rough-diamond expert and Martyna Brychcy, a gemologist, lead quality control on copper.

Find out more about our New Ventures Competition, a start-up approach to innovation in the firm.",2018-05-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Innovation,Entrepreneurship",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/accelerating-entrepreneurship-the-new-ventures-competition,"Accelerating entrepreneurship: Our New Ventures Competition The team behind the Real Estate Portfolio Optimizer solution, from left: Sarah McEwen, Conrad Voorsanger, Navin Verma, Mariana Jimenez Werther, Halil Cobuloglu, Linda Dempah, Bruce Simpson and Albert Fan. May 15, 2018 Imagine this: you envision a groundbreaking technology solution that will completely change how your clients do business. After pitching your idea alongside other budding entrepreneurs, you secure the funding needed to turn your idea into reality. With a team of expert developers, designers, and advisers, you’re able to bring your product to clients in just 3 months. This sounds like a pretty typical path for a Silicon Valley tech start-up—but it may be surprising to know that it’s also happening here at McKinsey through our New Ventures Competition. The competition is part of McKinsey New Ventures, the firm’s internal innovation arm where we are using new technologies to accelerate and expand our impact with clients. “We are enhancing our client-service model and leveraging the creativity of all of our colleagues, ” says Bruce Simpson, senior partner in Toronto and one of the leaders of New Ventures, “This allows us to be at the forefront of innovation.” “The competition is a fun, fast-paced, but ultimately low-risk way to see what it’s like to work at a start-up,” says Bill O’Keefe , a partner in our Minneapolis office and a past winner for building a solution that helps small to midsize insurers create digital experiences and compete with larger providers. The competition begins with an application process open to anyone in the firm. Winning teams then go on to participate in a 3-month accelerator program, during which they build their projects with the guidance of senior sponsors. Winners work with engineers, technical developers, architects, data scientists, project managers, and designers to bring their ideas to life and receive legal, risk, and financial advice in addition to funding. “The real value happens when frameworks, models, and workflows developed through the competition begin to help our clients,” says Teresa Dietrich , who leads product and engineering for New Ventures. The competition isn’t McKinsey’s first attempt to internally crowdsource innovation. Twenty years ago, we initiated the firm’s Practice Olympics, where colleagues would submit proposals for new knowledge projects. With the rise of advanced analytics, machine learning, and other technologies, the Practice Olympics evolved into the New Ventures Competition and a methodology for McKinsey colleagues to develop solutions that rapidly deliver impact for clients. “The competition gave our idea life,” says Bill. “We wouldn’t have had the resourcing or the opportunity to expand into a new client segment without it.” Since its official start in 2016, the competition has received entries from over 4,000 colleagues, comprising some 870 idea teams. All of the firm’s regions and practice areas have been represented, and 90 percent of the winners who’ve completed the full process are now using their new approaches with clients—with 120 active clients among them. And several clients have asked us to help them create similar programs for themselves. Sarah McEwen , a former consultant with expertise in building innovations in the telecommunications industry, returned to the firm to oversee the competition. She says, “It’s amazing how quickly we can stand up these solutions—it’s been inspiring for both our clients and our colleagues.” One winning solution that’s already seeing traction is OMNI , which helps some of the most innovative brands in retail use geospatial insights to optimize location strategies for new stores. The idea was developed by a diverse team comprised of specialists in retail, geospatial analytics, and venture capital. “The best ideas come from the intersection of geographies, tenures, and backgrounds,” says OMNI manager Alana Podreciks . Another idea is ACE, a cloud-based solution that uses predictive analytics to help retail banks optimize their cash inventory, and is proving effective in Middle East markets. “Right before this, I was building a digital solution for a bank, so I knew what tools were needed,” says Andras Kovacs ,  an engagement manager with ACE. “The competition helped us move from an abstract idea into a real solution very quickly.” For colleagues looking to join Andras, Bill, Alana, and other innovators, the 2018 Competition is about to begin, with the deadline for submissions fast approaching on May 31. “I’m so excited by the ideas the New Ventures Competition is able to surface within the firm,” says Bruce. “It truly is a special platform, and we’re just beginning to see the incredible impact it will have.” Never miss a story"
Revving up analytics in Latin America with QuantumBlack,QuantumBlack— our acquired London-based advanced analytics firm— will be charting a new course this month as we introduce their capabilities to our analytics work in Latin America.,2018-05-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"AI & Analytics,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/revving-up-analytics-in-latin-america-with-quantumblack,"Revving up analytics in Latin America with QuantumBlack QuantumBlack’s CEO Jeremy Palmer and cofounder and director Simon Williams, McKinsey’s Pepe Cafferata, a partner and head of QuantumBlack Latin America, and Marina Cigarini, a senior partner, at the opening breakfast event in São Paulo May 31, 2018 Two and a half years ago, we acquired QuantumBlack , a London-based advanced analytics firm that specializes in helping clients find and use small, previously unnoticed details in their data to significantly improve performance and find new areas of growth. QuantumBlack has roots in Formula 1 racing, where data and analytics are second nature. With locations in Europe, North America, India, and Australia, QuantumBlack will be charting a new course this month as we introduce their capabilities to our analytics work in Latin America. A flurry of launch events, including a breakfast in São Paulo, client forums, and talks marked the occasion. What does this mean for our Latin American clients? “Our clients in Latin America, like elsewhere in the world, are looking to drive value from data and analytics to transform their businesses, so adding QuantumBlack’s unique approach and capabilities will help them accelerate that journey,” says Pepe Cafferata , a McKinsey partner and head of QuantumBlack Latin America. “There’s just tremendous demand for it now,” he adds. Pepe, along with other São Paulo-based McKinsey colleagues—like Alexandre Montoro —spent 6 months on rotation at QuantumBlack’s London headquarters this past year. “We integrated ourselves into their teams, living and breathing their protocol that we’re now bringing back with us to our clients here in the region,” says Alexandre. “We call it the five i’s—short for our five stages of ideation, intelligence, inception, intervention, and independence,” says Simon Williams , cofounder and director of QuantumBlack. The challenge with most organizations is they often have so much data but aren’t using it to its full potential. “We go in and study how to access it, clean it, connect the dots, and draw out insights to improve performance.” “In the advanced analytics space, which moves so fast, we know tech can become obsolete within 6 to 9 months” states Jeremy Palmer , CEO of QuantumBlack. “Having a repeatable and scalable methodology is just as important—if not more—than all the bells and whistles.” Capability building for clients is also at the core of QuantumBlack’s approach. Through training, mentorship, and secondments, “our goal is to hand off a model that clients can then run on their own after we’re gone so they can be independent,” says Jeremy.  “We’re focused on the long term—on performance gain and cultural change where continuous improvements become part of an organization’s DNA.” As for the types of projects slated for Latin America, “they’ll be in line with QuantumBlack’s trademark of groundbreaking and complex work,” says Heitor Martins , a senior partner. “Doing transformative work that’s completely new to the world—that’s their bread and butter. When you combine that ability with McKinsey’s expertise to drive change at scale across global organizations, you have an unbeatable combination.” Some past examples of this include using machine learning to detect more than 85 percent of invoice fraud for a leading bank, accelerating time to market for new drugs through up to 15 percent faster enrolment on clinical trials, and speeding up design and engineering processes by three months for an automotive company. Like elsewhere in McKinsey Analytics, teams will be made up of McKinsey’s industry and functional experts—along with QuantumBlack’s data scientists, data engineers, technical architects, machine-learning experts, and designers. Talks about making this kind of move began over a year and a half ago between McKinsey partners that included Marina Cigarini , Heitor, Pepe, Simon, and Jeremy. “We saw this physical ‘coming together’ as a natural evolution for how we’ve been bridging our broad domain expertise with QuantumBlack’s design, data, and advanced-analytics horsepower from the start,” says Heitor. São Paulo represents a logical next step for QuantumBlack, given McKinsey’s existing analytics hub. “We’ve already hit the ground running with a significant lighthouse project underway,” says Pepe. For the past two months, the joint McKinsey–QuantumBlack team has already been applying this new way of working with a major bank in Latin America. “Between financial, manufacturing, mining, and other industries, there’s just tons of data out there that’s yet to be exploited here,” says Jeremy. “We see so much opportunity. It’s not just about driving performance improvement—it’s about fundamentally changing business models and reinventing how people work.” Learn more about QuantumBlack here . Never miss a story"
HBR McKinsey Award winners: Good management matters more than we realize,"This spring, we announced the winner of the HBR McKinsey Award for the best Harvard Business Review article of 2017: &ldquo;Why do we undervalue competent management?,&rdquo; by professors Raffaella Sadun, Nicholas Bloom, and John Van Reenen.",2018-06-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Awards,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/hbr-mckinsey-award-winners-good-management-matters-more-than-we-realize,"HBR McKinsey Award winners: Good management matters more than we realize The winning spread as it appeared in Harvard Business Review’s September-October 2017 issue. June 4, 2018 This spring, we announced the winner of the HBR McKinsey Award for the best Harvard Business Review article of 2017: “ Why do we undervalue competent management? ,” by professors Raffaella Sadun , Nicholas Bloom , and John Van Reenen . While headlines might herald technological innovation as the mover and shaker of today’s economy, this trio’s research uncovers the outsize impact of good management practices on a company’s—and by extension, entire countries’—growth. The authors, who are based in the United States, created a massive body of research on this topic for more than 15 years. Since 1959, the HBR McKinsey Awards have recognized practical and groundbreaking management thinking by determining the best articles published each year in Harvard Business Review, as determined by an independent panel of business and academic leaders with input from members of HBR’s Advisory Board. This year’s announcement appears in the May-June issue of the magazine. We sat down recently with Raffaella and John to learn more. What inspired your research? Why this topic? John: I’ve always been really interested in productivity models and growth because they are part of why countries become wealthier over time. Understanding productivity growth and why there are such stark differences between firms or between countries has been a big mystery for economists, social scientists, and business people for decades. Most folks intuitively understand that management practices are important, and McKinsey has done great work to understand these practices. The question was, just how important are they? We started doing the grunt work—the first big survey of firms, 732 companies in France, Germany, the UK and the US—in 2004. Now, we have 20,000 interviews from 34 countries. Around 15 years ago, a prominent scholar came to do a talk at LSE (the London School of Economics and Political Science) on behalf of the British government to discuss why the UK’s productivity growth was so low. At dinner after the talk, I asked him if he thought management practices had anything to do with it. He didn’t think so — but admitted that no convincing evidence existed, one way or the other. I was sitting next to a senior partner from McKinsey, so I asked him, “Well, what do you think?” And he said, “I think that’s right – management is a factor in Britain’s weaker performance.” From that conversation, we started talking about how McKinsey and other consulting firms approach companies, conduct initial diagnostics, try to get ideas about basic management practices, collect information, and use that for improving targets and incentives. That was the start of it—thinking about how you can measure management practices systematically across companies, industries, and countries. We started doing the grunt work—the first big survey of firms, 732 companies in France, Germany, the UK and the US—in 2004. Now, we have 20,000 interviews from 34 countries. And the research is not just from manufacturing companies but also hospitals, schools and retailers. And other researchers are applying the methods to many other sectors. How did you come to work together on this? Raffaella: I had just started my PhD at LSE. That was a time when few people were looking at micro-level data from companies. The project could uncover productivity differences within countries, and even compare development and growth across countries—it was phenomenal. I got the research bug from John and Nick, who had just started working on this. The partnership started from that, in 2003. This database sounds like it has been an epic undertaking. Raffaella: We collected the data via phone interviews over four or five waves of data collecting. And every time we’d do a wave of data collection, we’d convert a conference center into a call center, select large teams of MBA students (at one point we had a team of 40 people just within a summer), and work with them for about three months. This is an effort that’s involved many, many people over time. If that moment of mutual understanding between the workforce and the management doesn’t happen, you basically have no chance. John: We have hundreds of students and other researchers who have been part of this project. It’s spawned a whole community of people who are very interested in getting a better idea of what’s going on with management around the world. What sort of questions were on the survey? What were the practices you were checking for? Raffaella: They’re the basic processes. As John was saying, these were things previously recognized as processes that existed in high-performing firms. They’re typically not capital intensive, either. Our survey consists of open-ended questions across four domains: production monitoring, targets, people management, and lean management. For example, the questions we ask about production monitoring include a question that asks our interviewees—the plant managers—how they keep track of their production. It’s very open-ended, and we ask for examples. Some plant managers would say they had very few systematic ways of keeping track of what was happening on the shop floor or that even if they had some system in place, it was not providing information that was actionable: the data was not visualized, or it was not accessible to people who would make good use of it. In our scoring system, that would be a place that doesn’t adopt a good process when it comes to monitoring of production. At the other extreme, you have companies that take these monitoring processes seriously. The surprise, looking at the data, is that even if we know that these things are intuitively basic, there’s tremendous variation in how these basic practices are adopted across companies. Out of all of this data, and your analysis, what surprised you most? Raffaella: Even the fact that there was a variation in management practices was a surprise, to some extent. It’s something that economists and business people would not expect: these disciplines more or less say, if you’re really badly managed, you shouldn’t be in business; or if a process is really beneficial to firm performance, it should be quickly imitated. We should try to understand better what drives this variation. Why, if these processes are known and basic, are certain organizations so slow to adopt them? John: I totally agree. One of the things we did toward the end of the survey was ask the question, “How well do you think your firm is managing itself, on a scale of one to ten?” It turned out, most people think they’re absolutely awesome managers. The vast majority thought their firms were really well managed. What was more surprising, and maybe a bit depressing, was that the answer to that self-assessment—contrary to the objective scoring done in the interview—was totally uncorrelated with any measure of performance or productivity. What I take from that is, one of the barriers to the diffusion of good management practices is that many companies really don’t know how badly managed they are. What’s the relationship between workforce learning and management? Raffaella: I think this is a fundamental point that’s often missed because there’s a very mechanistic way of looking at the workforce. It turns out that really implementing these practices requires that everyone has a fundamental understanding of them and believes in them. The workforce really needs to buy into the value of management processes and trust that you’ll share in the growth that results. If that moment of mutual understanding between the workforce and the management doesn’t happen, you basically have no chance. So perhaps some of the problem is training, but it is also the softer part of the relationship between workers, managers, and owners. John: One of the interesting things is that people often think it’s all about the talent, or the ability, or the education of the managers to determine whether or not management practices are successful. And, yes, we see that in our data: the managers who are more able seem to have better practices. But we also find that just as important is the training and education of the workforce. It’s profoundly misleading to think it all comes down to the single person on top. One thing you want people to understand about your research? John: My main thing: management really matters. Not just for the particular organization you happen to be in; it actually matters much more widely across the whole country that you’re living in. It matters in terms of understanding the wealth of nations. People underestimate its importance. Raffaella: I agree completely. And you can go beyond that. One of the most rewarding things about this project is that we can see in the data that these processes are correlated with things that everyone cares about, like surviving a heart attack in a hospital and making sure your kids get a good education.

<em>Go Long</em>: Stories from six CEOs on taking a long-term view,"Rodney Zemmel, managing partner of McKinsey&rsquo;s US Northeast offices, shares the inspiration behind the latest book he&rsquo;s co-authored on long-term thinking.",2018-06-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Social Impact,Long-termism,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/go-long-stories-from-six-ceos-on-taking-a-long-term-view,"Go Long : Stories from six CEOs on taking a long-term view Rodney Zemmel, senior partner and co-author of Go Long June 6, 2018 When Hewlett-Packard board director Maggie Wilderotter wrote a letter to management recommending a fresh look, a radical change in strategy is what she had mind. With the support of CEO Meg Whitman, the board helped push the executive team outside its comfort zone to reorganize—and drop some of its divisions that were no longer creating value and instead focus on newer areas, like data-center services. The result of this new direction was a smaller, more tech-focused company with $35 billion in annual sales. Long-term decisions like this are the subject of a new book, Go Long , that hit shelves this past month. It’s coauthored by Rodney Zemmel , managing partner of McKinsey’s New York, Boston, and Stamford offices. For more than a decade McKinsey has been publishing on the benefits of taking a long- term view , most often from an investor perspective. Go Long uniquely takes more of a managerial perspective, profiling six leading businesses that ignored short-term pressures and reaped significant benefits as a result. The book’s authors gathered last week in New York for an evening panel to discuss and celebrate the launch of the book. Moderated by Michael Stewart, global vice chairman at Edelman and McKinsey alumnus, the panel was joined by Bill McNabb, chairman of the board of Vanguard. The discussion began with a two-pronged question: “Why this book?” and “why now?” “My coauthors and I are organizers of an annual gathering of US business leaders called CEO Academy ,” says Rodney. “In recent years we’ve heard growing interest from attendees on the topic of managing for the long term.” A closer look at research coming out of McKinsey Global Institute and Focusing Capital on the Long Term (FCLT) shows that some of the short-term thinking happening across companies is actually self-imposed—with CEOs getting in their own way. “In order to make a point, you need to have stories,” says Rodney. “That’s why we spoke to CEOs to record what this type of thinking and behavior actually looks like rather than just offer theories and research.” Go Long documents some of the world’s most prominent business leaders, chronicling their experiences and the hard decisions they’ve had to make to take a long-term approach. For example, the book takes readers through CVS CEO Larry Merlo’s decision to pull tobacco off its shelves and take a $2 billion hit in order to turn the company into the healthcare giant it is today. In order to make a point, you need to have stories. Throughout his 20-plus-year career at McKinsey, Rodney has been interested in understanding what makes a successful CEO, and, as discussed in Go Long , he’s found that taking a long-term view is one important factor. With a PhD in molecular biology, he has been focused in part on helping leaders at pharmaceuticals and healthcare and healthcare-adjacent institutions with their long-term growth strategies. When writing Go Long “we wanted to show the importance of striking a balance between short- and long-term thinking,” Rodney says. “After all—long-termism is made up of a lot of short-term periods.” During the panel discussion, Bill shared how Vanguard has applied much of this kind of thinking into its own corporate strategy by putting metrics in place around a ten-year horizon. “We look at factors like employee engagement, fund performance for investors, client loyalty, and operating expenses,” he said. “We know you can’t just wait until year eight, though, to get started on all this.” Rodney reaffirmed the effectiveness of this type of strategy, sharing a few common actions that contributed to the successes of companies referenced in the book. “First is the importance of communicating your long-term vision; second is having metrics in place on both long-term strategy and traditional performance; and third is ensuring that boards spend sufficient time on long-term strategy and set up the discussion in the right way.” All panelists agreed that to ultimately see real behavior change within companies, the right incentives—which could be in the form of tying long-term decisions to compensation— need to be in place.

June 13, 2018 On Monday night, our global managing partner, Dominic Barton, received the 20/20 Visionary Award from The Trevor Project . The award recognizes businesses and business leaders that empower their employees to be themselves both personally and professionally and that give back to the community, especially LGBTQ youth. McKinsey “has done a huge amount for LGBTQ people in general, for youth specifically, and for The Trevor Project in particular,” Amit Paley, The Trevor Project CEO and executive director, said in a recent interview with Forbes . “They have had supportive policies early on for their employees who are part of same-sex relationships, [they have] an LGBTQ employee group and it covers gender-affirmation surgery for trans employees. [Dominic] Barton, in particular, has been integral in pushing for policies and creating a culture at McKinsey that supports the LGBTQ community."" “I am personally honored and humbled to accept the 20/20 Visionary Award on behalf of McKinsey,” said Dominic in his acceptance speech last night, “and am deeply inspired by the life-saving work that The Trevor Project is doing for LGBTQ youth and for the broader community. As Amit says, it’s so important that our LGBTQ youth know that they are beautiful and that they are not alone. We want the best people in the world—in all the ways that they are diverse.” In its 20th year, The Trevor Project provides crisis-intervention services to end suicide among gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and other young people around the United States. They’re on track to directly serve 75,000 callers, chatters, and texters this year. LGBT youth are five times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. Forty percent of transgender people have attempted suicide. Every 3 minutes in the United States, a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer young person tries to kill themselves. McKinsey and The Trevor Project have developed a close relationship. In 2012, a New York associate volunteered to work as a Trevor lifeline counselor, along with 20 other McKinsey consultants and colleagues. That consultant, Amit Paley, now heads the organization. During that first engagement, our volunteers helped conduct the first-ever analysis of its crisis services and helped the main crisis line reduce the number of missed calls to 2 percent, a much lower number than nearly every peer organization. Since then, McKinsey has provided The Trevor Project with pro bono support. Our volunteers have helped The Trevor Project create strategic plans for departments, analyze operational effectiveness, and build the skills of in-house teams. Last year, after helping with the strategic planning process as a consultant volunteer, Sam Dorison became The Trevor Project’s chief of staff. ""As someone who worked as project lead for Trevor while also volunteering as a digital counselor, I can see that McKinsey's impact on our organization is immeasurable,” Sam said. “We're proud to honor Dominic at TrevorLIVE New York for his innovative leadership, because without partners like him, we wouldn't be able to continue The Trevor Project’s important and life-saving work.” At their annual TrevorLIVE New York gala , hosted by Olympians Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon, Dominic was singled out along with Emmy Award–winning screenwriter, producer, and actor Lena Waithe and Golden Globe Award–nominated writer, director, and producer Greg Berlanti.

June 21, 2018 We’re pleased to announce the winner of this year’s Cambridge-McKinsey Risk Prize: Ann Sofie Cloots, whose winning essay, “Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain, and Risk Management: Legal, Operational and Systemic Risks,” took on one of the hottest topics in technology today. She was awarded a prize of £3,000 at the annual conference of the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies on June 20, attended by finance, industry, and academic delegates. The Risk Prize awards the best essay on risk management by a current master’s or PhD student at Cambridge University. The judging panel included representatives from the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies, Cambridge Judge Business School, and McKinsey’s Risk Practice. At McKinsey, we study the ways that the world is changing every day. Our Risk Practice helps organizations across all industries build resilience and create value. As the global business and economic environment faces greater volatility, a risk-informed strategy can be a major source of competitive advantage. Trained as a lawyer, Ann Sofie spent the last few years completing her PhD in economics. During that time, she became interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain. She noted how what started with cyberpunk leanings has grown more and more institutionalized: “I was always reading about it, but I was focused on finishing my PhD. It’s always been a big curiosity of mine and this essay was the perfect opportunity.” Ann Sofie would like to continue her research in Cambridge. “It’s an amazing place to be if you’re interested in the blockchain.” As for her essay, she said, “my hope is that anybody who is vaguely interested, who wants to understand the risks behind the hype, the risks that we may not be discussing sufficiently” will read it. As the global business and economic environment faces greater volatility, a risk-informed strategy can be a major source of competitive advantage. She was chosen among two other finalists, Sean Day and Sipke Shaughnessy . Sean’s essay “Strategic Risks Threatening US Hospital Systems,” lays out how trends may combine to upend hospitals. “My essay highlights business risks for large hospital systems in the United States, particularly focusing on two trends that are more uncertain: the interoperability of IT and the degree of consumerism—what power do patients have?” he explained. If he could have anyone read his essay, it “would be leaders of large hospital systems, like the CEO of Kaiser or Mayo Clinic.” Sean, who hails from New York, studied bioengineering and completed a Watson Fellowship, during which he traveled around the world and explored healthcare systems in Ethiopia, India, and Japan, among others. During that time, he recognized the need for systemic solutions and joined a leading e-health vendor as a business and operations analyst. He just completed his master’s in technology policy at Cambridge, and said, “This essay was a cool way to combine all of those interests.” Sean hopes to continue working in the field of digital health in the United States. Sipke’s essay, “How do East Africa’s Pastoralists Deal with Risk?,” observes how certain traditional practices are founded on widely applicable principles that could help with risk management in any business. “Pastoralists are people who herd livestock, and frequently do so nomadically,” he said. These pastoralists have developed many ways that reinforce a strong and wide social safety net, through practices like ritualized gift giving, which are intended to create strong bonds among different individuals and different households. “That enables them to pool their risk, so that in cases where households see their herd decimated, they can ask people who they have given gifts to reciprocate and contribute a heifer that could help them rebuild their livestock herd. Interdependence between families or firms can be seen as a strength rather than a weakness.” Sipke grew up in County Cork, Ireland. “I grew up around a lot of cows, so maybe that’s where the interest in pastoralists started,” he said. He’s currently pursuing his PhD in the geography department, where his research explores how pastoralists have dealt with new economic developments like land privatization and cash-based markets. He conducted interviews, but he also tried to participate in the local economy himself by buying his own herd of goats. All of the winning essays can be downloaded here .

A conversation with new global managing partner Kevin Sneader July 2, 2018 Today marks the first working day in the office for Kevin Sneader, our new global managing partner. We sat down with Kevin to get a sense of his priorities, his leadership style, and how he sees the challenges and opportunities ahead. Will you lead McKinsey differently from Dominic Barton? Gosh, what will I do differently from Dom? That presumes I want to do a lot differently. I don’t. Dom was a terrific leader, is a terrific leader. I’m very fortunate in that I arrive [in the office] at a time when McKinsey is really firing on all cylinders. We’ve got a remarkable track record on recruiting. We’ve got a terrific set of clients. And I think we have real momentum in terms of how we’re performing across the globe. But as Dom always taught me as a member of his operating committee, we should be restless. We should be constantly looking to change. I was elected on February 24—a date I won’t forget in a hurry—and here we are in July. And in those 100 days, I’ve had a chance to announce a leadership team, to announce some changes to the way the firm is structured, and to announce some priorities. One of the areas we’ve not made as much progress as any of us would like is diversity. I think there are a number of things we can do. First, all of us need to see it as an absolute priority. It’s one of my top priorities, something I’m talking about a lot. The good news is I think it’s broadly embraced [as a priority] in our firm. We get that it’s important. The second thing is that we need to put resources and leadership into tackling the challenge. That’s why I’ve asked Lareina Yee , from our San Francisco office, to step into a leadership role solely focused on what we’re calling All-In, which is what we call our efforts on women, and also inclusion and diversity more broadly. It’s not a symbolic appointment. We’re putting real resources, targets, and goals behind her and our efforts collectively to make progress. We won’t rest until 51 percent of the people who join our firm are female. We won’t rest until we have female representation in our partnership that’s at least above 40 percent. The third and perhaps the most important thing we can do is to take our own medicine. We’ve written a lot about the power of parity , women in the workplace . We’ve written about diversity . Whenever we write about something, we need to make sure we’re acting on it. I really want us to live up to everything we write about, and make sure we’re putting it into practice. How will McKinsey change over the next 3 to 5 years? One of the things that Dom has regularly said, and rightly said, is that 50 percent of what we do today didn’t exist even 5 years ago. I’m pretty confident this will be true, and even more true, let’s say 3 years from now. We’re going to continue to have a different set of clients. We’re now working in areas we never worked in before. The amount of technology work we’re doing, the kind of clients we’re serving, both large and small, is very different than [who] we served before. I think this will continue. Importantly, I think the people of our firm will change. We’ve been attracting huge numbers of talented colleagues from very different backgrounds than we ever had before. It was just a start to bring in people who’ve got creative backgrounds . The number of people who bring non-MBA capabilities [to McKinsey] has been progressing over many years. I think, again, over the next 3 years, that’s going to accelerate. We’ll have new people joining us with completely different backgrounds to those we’ve recruited before. The other thing that will change is the way we work. I think the days of handing clients an answer are over. Today it is much more about how we work together [with clients] to bring about change. The word “transformation” may be overused, but it is true that we’re increasingly working on efforts to transform our clients through the combination of technology, new ways of organizational thinking, and classic strategy. We’re building our capabilities in digital and analytics by bringing together those areas, and also our design capability. We’re building capabilities in transformation by bringing together the many different transformation approaches we’ve been applying with our clients. We’re looking at new ways to help build our clients’ capabilities with the McKinsey Academy and McKinsey Implementation . As we put these together, and we’re calling them growth platforms, that’s a whole new set of capabilities that I think could power a lot of our ability to really make a difference for our clients. What lessons have been learned from events in South Africa? South Africa has been a wake-up call for all of us. I think there’s a lot we have to learn from what went wrong there . If we get things wrong, I think we should admit it. We need to find a way to engage with those who bring to our attention the things we get wrong. One of the challenges in South Africa is the reality that we didn’t realize quickly enough how badly things had gone, and therefore we didn’t engage with civil society to really work together to make sure we’re on the right side of change in a country that we care deeply about. We did make some mistakes in our governance, too. And so we’ve gone back and looked hard at how we think about who we serve [as clients] and how we partner with other organizations. We’ve looked hard at how we enforce the decisions made by our committees, because we did actually conduct very effective diligence in South Africa that said we should not be partnering with this third party. It just took too long to act on that. That can never happen again. So we’re making changes to our governance. I’m confident we’ll learn from South Africa. But the one other thing I think is really important is that we’ve made a commitment to stay in South Africa, to make sure we’re on the side of good, to help the country develop. That’s my real hope: that we can still be a positive force in Africa, and in South Africa in particular. We’re very committed to doing this. But there’s a lot to learn, and we’re taking the lessons very seriously. What are the biggest challenges facing McKinsey? The reality is we face many challenges. The challenges range from the amount of scrutiny there is externally on our firm. I think we need to embrace this, understand that we are in the public arena, and if we’re in that arena, be as open and transparent as possible about ourselves—while also protecting and maintaining the confidentiality that our clients rightly expect about how we treat their information and what we do for them. That’s one challenge. A second challenge is the war for talent. It’s incredibly hot. The good news is that our recruiting proposition seems to be stronger than ever. We’re ranked number one in terms of how we’re seen by prospective employees in North America , Europe , and Asia–Pacific . Nobody’s ever done that before. I’m not going to be so complacent as to assume that’s ours forever. We’re going to work very hard to keep that position. A third challenge is that we face competition. There are new firms coming in to try to do what we do. These are organizations that come from hard-technology backgrounds as well as more traditional competition. We’re not going to rest on any laurels. We’re going to be constantly looking to innovate on top of the very strong base we have in top management consulting and the ways in which we think about solving problems. But add to that technology, and new organizational approaches. The last thing we should be doing is trying to stand still and pretend that the answer we had a few years ago will be the answer for tomorrow.

Generation: Helping Hong Kong&rsquo;s youth discover a different path to success,"In Hong Kong, the McKinsey-founded non-profit, Generation, is helping young people and employers tackle skill challenges.",2018-07-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/helping%20hong%20kongs%20youth%20build%20better%20careers/blog-generation-hk-hero_1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Generation,Asia",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/helping-hong-kongs-youth-build-better-careers,"Generation: Helping Hong Kong’s youth discover a different path to success Graduates from the inaugural class of Generation X CLAP’s customer service program in Hong Kong July 6, 2018 When Generation , the global youth-employment non-profit founded by McKinsey, was planning its expansion into new geographies, Hong Kong was probably not at the top of its list. On paper, the city has some of the lowest levels of youth unemployment in the world—by some counts as low as 3 percent and certainly well below the 13 percent global average. But scratch below the surface and you’ll find a growing gap between the education that young people receive and the skills required to do well today—and in the future. Employers in the city know this well. In customer-service roles, for example, it is not uncommon for staff to stay little more than 3 months in entry-level positions, such is the mismatch between the skills and expectations they have and the realities of the role. Applicants have higher-level degrees but lack practical and social skills, such as customer orientation, persistence, teamwork, and taking personal responsibility. For McKinsey colleagues in Hong Kong, who for more than a decade have provided pro bono consulting to public- and social-sector organizations that serve the city’s youth, it felt like Generation could be part of the solution. Generation works to train and place learners in high-demand, entry-level jobs, supporting them with the technical, behavioral, and mind-set skills they need to be high performers right from the start, resulting in longer retention and faster speed to promotion. What excites me about Generation is that it enables young people to rediscover their potential. “Our office has deep-rooted commitment to supporting young people in Hong Kong,” explains Joe Ngai , managing partner of McKinsey’s Greater China office. “It’s something that really matters to our colleagues. They want as many young people as possible to be able to access the best opportunities.” Working closely with local business leaders Allen Ha, CEO of AsiaWorld-Expo, a large events venue in the city, and Ming-Wai Lau, who chairs Hong Kong’s Commission on Youth, Joe and a team of colleagues set out to understand how Generation could make a difference. “Allen and Ming-Wai were really excited by the idea and saw a lot of potential,” Joe says. “Ming-Wai even travelled to Washington, DC, to see a Generation program in action.” McKinsey and Generation began by studying Hong Kong’s youth-employment challenge, to understand the experiences of both employers and young people. “Young people feel great pressure to perform. There is a deeply rooted societal norm that higher education is the only path to success,” explains Brian Cheng, who leads Generation Hong Kong. “Our research also found that many recruiters continue to use graduate-education qualifications as a screening criteria, even for entry-level jobs. But the graduates often don’t have the basic skills they need to succeed in the role, such as the ability to handle a difficult customer or colleague. This leads to high staff turnover for employers and dissatisfaction for young people.” Brian, who has spent the last decade working in higher education, found himself increasingly frustrated at seeing young people with talent being written off because they may not have had the resources or opportunity to secure the higher education that employers in Hong Kong demand. “What excites me about Generation,” says Brian, “is that it enables young people to rediscover their potential—to find a new, accessible path to realizing their ambitions.” The report was highlighted at an event in Hong Kong last month to launch Generation X CLAP, a partnership between Generation and CLAP for Youth , an initiative founded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club—which has one of the world’s largest charitable trusts—to address the challenges young people face navigating the Hong Kong job market. Kathy, 22, is a graduate from the inaugural class. Despite studying for a foundation diploma in hospitality, she found it difficult to secure a hotel front-desk job without higher-education qualifications. Instead, she has had a series of short-term roles, working as a sales assistant in a clothing store and as an office receptionist, without a clear pathway for career advancement. “I saw Generation as a way to empower myself to start the career that I really want,” Kathy says. “Generation’s training emphasizes not only job-related technical skills but also mind-sets and behaviors,” which can be applied to any future job environment. As a result of the program, I feel more confident when presenting myself to employers.” The first program in Hong Kong, for customer-service roles in hotels, launched in April with a 5-week boot camp. Its graduates are now taking up placements with partner employers. Globally, 85 percent of Generation graduates are placed in jobs within 90 days, the majority remain employed one year after placement, and they earn two to six times the income they were earning prior to the program. “We really like the Generation graduates who came to the interview,” explains one Hong Kong hotel manager. “They show not only passion and enthusiasm in joining our hotel but also their performance in the interviews was stronger than a lot of our previous candidates with even higher academic qualifications. We were impressed by the maturity and strong problem-solving skills.” According to Generation, 98 percent of employers say they would hire graduates of the program again. We were impressed by the maturity and strong problem-solving skills of Generation graduates. Alice, another student, illustrates why. “For me, Generation offered access to opportunities that I had never been able to reach before. During the first week of the program, I went to class from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and then went straight to work from 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM. It was normally 1:00 AM when I could go to bed. I did think of giving up, but I remembered the mind-set training on persistence that we covered in class. I decided to show my persistence and make a change for my own future.” Launched in eight countries since it was founded in 2015, Generation has plans to open in three new geographies in Asia and Europe by the end of 2018. Its graduates number in excess of 20,000 young people globally. Never miss a story"

Bolo. Unnati. Haven. There’s also Balikbayan, El Trueque Polar, Droplet, and KeyPool. Eight refreshing, simple ways to help improve the lives of people in the world left behind by traditional financial services. These eight solutions address such challenges as personal banking for the illiterate, reduction of the fraud that allows for land grabs, and money management in hyperinflated economies. They are also the winners in the first challenge McKinsey designed and sponsored as part of the D&AD New Blood Awards . D&AD is a London-based, not-for-profit design and advertising organization founded in 1962. The New Blood Awards are among the most prestigious in the design world. They identify the next generation of creative talent—both students and working designers—under the age of 24. Challenges cover all aspects of design and creative thinking and are sponsored by companies such as adidas, Adobe, and BBC. “It’s like winning the Oscars,” says Kwame Nyanning , a senior expert in design based in McKinsey’s London office who helped organize the firm’s participation and served on the jury. Winners have access to skills training, which many times leads to job opportunities. The awards are designated as “Pencils,” with four levels of achievement. Why participate in this program now? Our firm has grown to the size of a top ten design firm through acquisitions such as LUNAR, Veryday, and carbon12 creative , in addition to the development of internal talent. “We champion creativity, and it was a chance to introduce the young designers of the world to this new professional area of consulting, which is quite different than working in an agency or design firm,” explains Kwame. “The problems tend to be more complex; the relationships are long term, working with ongoing dependencies and complications. And the talent tends to be more diverse—a team can include researchers, service designers, mechanical engineers, and analytics experts.” Anett Tarnokova , a senior recruiter who helped lead the project, explains the thinking behind the McKinsey challenge: “We wanted to approach digital finance in a different context—to help people who didn’t have a say in the financial market, which is very much in the ethos of our firm’s work for social impact. We gathered an international team, with people from Berlin, Dubai, and London, and brought together elements of service, user experience, product-design and -systems thinking.” The briefs were published online at the end of October. “There was quite a lot of anticipation: who would choose our brief, which required quite a bit more work, from among the more visual-communication pieces, sponsored by media and consumer brands,” Tarnokova recalls. Over the next few months, there were some 5,000 downloads of the brief from 80 countries, with 53 full submissions and, ultimately, eight Pencil winners. There are four Pencil levels of the D&AD New Blood awards: Wood, Yellow, Graphite, and Black. Wood Pencils are awarded for the best in advertising and design; Graphite Pencils for work with an original, inspiring idea at its core; Yellow Pencils for work at the pinnacle of creative excellence; and the rare Black Pencil for work that is truly groundbreaking. There is an additional category in which a specially selected jury awards the White Pencil for work across any of the 17 briefs and 3,500 entries that uses creativity as a force for good. On July 12, 2018, two entries in the McKinsey category—Bolo and YETU—won two of the four White Pencils. How did they use creativity for good? Let’s see. India is the fastest growing smartphone market in the world, and the government has provided bank accounts to every household. Yet many remain untouched, because India has the highest illiteracy rate in the world. This is where Bolo —meaning “speak” in Hindi—comes in. Bolo was created by a team of students from the Miami Ad School in San Francisco. It is the first voice-activated payment app for mobile devices of its kind, recognizing 23 languages spoken in India. It offers the potential to help millions of citizens activate their own bank accounts. YETU addresses the global issue of land grabs, inspired by Megan Egan’s early work in Tanzania. She is a student at the School of Communication Arts 2.0 in London. “I spent a month in a small town called Babati back in 2010, where I heard stories of families losing their homes, livelihoods, everything, due to corrupt businesses and governments faking land-registry documents and taking their land to build on,” she recalls. “[My colleague] Jonothan Hunt had been telling me about innovation in blockchain technology, and we joined the dots—to create YETU, which means “ours” in Ugandan.” Every time a land purchase is made, this cryptocurrency adds proof of ownership to an encrypted, digital land registry, which is then continually updated. “We’ve been blown away by how much positive feedback we’ve received,” Egan said. “We have a very clear idea of how we want it to develop and grow—and make our ‘pie in the sky’ idea a reality.” See the other six winners here .

100 leaders commit to advancing LGBTQ+ diversity,McKinsey&rsquo;s long-running efforts to advance LGBTQ+ diversity reached a milestone this month with the inaugural meeting of The Alliance.,2018-07-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/one%20hundred%20leaders%20commit%20to%20advancing%20lgbtq%20diversity/alliance-thumb_1536x1536.jpg,"Social Impact,Diversity",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/one-hundred-leaders-commit-to-advancing-lgbtq-diversity,"100 leaders commit to advancing LGBTQ+ diversity The inaugural meeting of The Alliance in Lisbon, Portugal, convened more than one hundred private-, public-, and social-sector LGBTQ leaders. July 26, 2018 On a brisk March evening in 1995, in Washington DC, 14 colleagues gather at the home of a McKinsey partner.  Their objective: to build a community and network within the firm to support LGBTQ colleagues, and to help the firm address barriers to recruitment, inclusion, and advancement of this underrepresented community. Fast forward to 2018. This group has become Equal at McKinsey, a vibrant global network of more than 600 colleagues, with a community of supporting “allies” in excess of 3,000. This month McKinsey marked another milestone in our journey to advance inclusion and diversity for the LGBTQ community, when we convened the inaugural meeting of The Alliance , in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference brought together more than 115 private-, public-, and social-sector LGBTQ leaders from 19 countries to discuss the inclusion and diversity agenda not just on a personal level and in their organizations but also in work and society more broadly. Diana Ellsworth , a partner based in our Atlanta office, was part of the 20-strong team at McKinsey behind The Alliance. “We all know that individuals from the LGBTQ community can face barriers —sometimes visible, sometimes invisible—in life and in work,” says Diana. “Many organizations are already trying to promote inclusion and diversity. But it is surprising how many people, still today, are ‘out’ in their personal lives but not at work.” Three years ago, McKinsey started to run executive master classes to help groups of newly hired or promoted senior executives from the LGBTQ community thrive in their new roles. “The Alliance was an idea that came from the alumni of our master classes,” he explains. “Participants were keenly interested in doing something beyond the individual level—they wanted to come together as a broader community to effect change.” The Lisbon agenda kicked off with a review of insights about the 455 million–strong LGBTQ community globally. Only 27 percent of this number self-identify, for reasons including social pressure or legal constraints. Research suggests that these often closeted lifestyles lead to poor-mental-health outcomes for LGBTQ individuals, with increased risks of suicide, substance abuse, and eating disorders compared with straight counterparts. Leaders who shared stories of their personal journeys and discussed the issues facing the LGBTQ community included Patrick McLaughlin, chief human resources officer at PepsiCo Frito-Lay, Amy Taylor, president and chief marketing officer at Red Bull North America, and Katrin Suder, former state secretary at Germany’s ministry of defense. One emerging theme from the discussions was the lack of evidence about LGBTQ inclusion in work and society. Because of the nature and complexity of self-identifying, accurately measuring the community and drawing meaningful conclusions is challenging. There can be no glass ceilings, no glass closets. Kevin Sneader, McKinsey’s global managing partner, took part in The Alliance. “I believe in our research that says that more inclusivity and more diversity is better,” said Kevin, speaking in Lisbon. “There can be no glass ceilings, no glass closets. The business case is clear for ethnic and gender diversity, and having it is correlated with success, but we don’t have the data for the LGBTQ community. We need it.” “Today I sat down with a group of people from around the world, from many different sectors, from manufacturing to banking to consumer goods. Hearing them talk about how we can make a difference to the broader community was incredibly inspiring.” Delegates at The Alliance sought out best practices to bring to their institutions. “There were some really smart and creative minds in the room, and there were a lot of ideas—for example, about mentoring, sponsorship, and role modeling—that I can take back to my organization to push inclusion forward,” one noted.

Reflecting the sense of opportunity that members felt to “move the needle” on LGBTQ inclusion, they agreed to an ambitious agenda. Members plan to strengthen the network, building connections among LGBTQ leaders in business, academia, and the social and public sectors. They committed to advancing civil rights in regions with low acceptance, encouraging inclusion through institutions. Finally, participants hope to focus on helping LGBTQ youth thrive in educational settings, the workplace, and in their personal lives. “There was so much energy in the room,” added Diana . “Each of the participants came to Lisbon with a clear mission to turn a group of individuals into an action-oriented and ambitious organization. It was exciting to see how motivated everyone was to be part of creating The Alliance.” related Managing partner Dominic Barton honored by The Trevor Project Out and proud at McKinsey Never miss a story"

We have the talent—we just need to get better at finding it and nurturing it.” Typically, exceptional young people are sought out, recognized, nurtured, and launched on successful career paths through fellowships, awards programs, internships, and scholarships. Annas knows this from his own experience. He is originally from the Middle East but grew up in Germany and had opportunities to develop a career trajectory through fellowships and programs that didn’t exist for his peers and family members in the Middle East. His answer: working with McKinsey to create a fellowship for Saudi university students that provides mentorship by senior executives, leadership training, and career opportunities. Called Qimam (meaning “the peak” or “tops”), the program’s first cohort of 50 fellows recently completed the program, giving it rave reviews. Early on, to get the initiative off the ground, Abedin approached some of his former colleagues. “The primary way we ‘give back’ in the Middle East is by developing talent through workshops and leadership programs, so this fit right in,” says Tom Isherwood , a partner based in McKinsey’s Dubai office who supports public-sector and education clients. “Qimam offered a way to broaden access to opportunities, to include those who may not come from the wealthiest families or the best schools. There’s tremendous talent here, but it’s not always where you expect it to be.” Isherwood and Abedin soon signed up 13 top organizations, both Saudi and multinational, spanning industries from mining to telecommunications. To develop the selection criteria and offerings, they studied programs such as the Rhodes Scholarships and the Truman Scholarships. They also leaned on McKinsey’s experience in designing leadership and education programs around the world, such as the Youth Leadership Academy in Malaysia . Initially, Abedin worried whether the program would appeal to applicants given that it didn’t offer a monetary component, such as a grant or prize. He need not have: 13,000 applications arrived within five weeks from all parts of the kingdom. More than 50 senior business leaders then interviewed 150 short-listed candidates, seeking individuals who not only had strong academic records but also showed initiative and social responsibility. The interviewers’ feedback was gratifying. “I’m so humbled; they’re so much better than I was at their age!” one executive confided to Abedin. “This makes me think differently about how I can raise my daughters and what opportunities they may have,” said another. Isherwood interviewed one young woman from a small city in a remote area in the kingdom who was picked on in school because she was of mixed ethnic background and whose father didn’t live with the family. She supported herself through university and, on the side, programmed robots and performed fund-raising to enter robotics competitions. “I was amazed by her resilience and determination,” Isherwood says. Over the course of 12 days, each Qimam fellow received personal career advice during one-on-one mentoring sessions with senior leaders in their fields and visited a variety of organizations on tours led by top executives. The group also attended leadership workshops and career training. Computer science student Aisha Dabbagh, for example, learned to overcome her fear of public speaking. “I thought to myself, ‘You’re only here for a few days; you have to challenge yourself,’” she says. She spoke out—“I was shivering and nervous,” she said—and, after finishing Qimam, decided to join a Toastmasters International club to keep developing her presentation skills. Importantly, the students had lots of opportunities to get to know one another, says Sumu AlKhudair, who is studying nanotechnology applications in solar energy and raises money for cancer and poverty. The fellows have established local groups and have had several meetings since the program ended. “We met as strangers and left as a tight-knit family,” says AlKhudair, who also received two internship offers from Qimam partners. Next year, the organizers plan to refine the program, and expansion beyond Saudi Arabia is likely in the coming years. But the goal remains unchanged: find and nurture the next generation of leaders from all types of backgrounds—to shape a resilient future for the country. Never miss a story"
Four experts show how AI solves real-world problems,Get a snapshot of the newest AI techniques and see how we are using them to help our clients solve their most intractable problems.,2018-09-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Our People,AI & Analytics,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/four-experts-show-how-ai-solves-real-world-problems,"Four experts show how AI solves real-world problems Through deep learning techniques, McKinsey experts identified a feature – ink blots – that can be used to detect fraudulent signatures. September 10, 2018 What better place to learn about the newest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) than at a place once called the ‘Tomorrow Lab’? McKinsey recently hosted an educational AI forum for press and colleagues in our Waltham, Massachusetts, office, which coincidentally started out in 1998 as a ‘Tomorrow Lab’. Following an initial stint as an accelerator for internet start-ups in the late 90s, the Waltham office became one of McKinsey’s major hubs for research and analytics . Here, some 350 data scientists, mathematicians, and developers (many of whom are doctors in their fields) are working across more than 40 different areas of expertise at any one time. At the forum, the talk was of data lakes, random forests, and “boiling the ocean.” Nature metaphors aside, it was a chance to experience our newest techniques for analyzing and modeling data to help our clients solve some of their most intractable problems. “The thinking in AI has changed from ‘What’s possible?’ to ‘How do I do this?’” explains Rafiq Ajani , the partner who leads the North American analytics group. “Quickly selecting the right algorithms and models from the many open-source options—and precisely customizing them for the use case—is where we are now. It’s not about ‘What’s the right answer?’ but ‘Am I asking the right questions?’—with more investment on the data side.” The general session was followed by a whirlwind tour of demos from our experts. Up first was Luke Gerdes , who joined McKinsey two years ago, after working for years as a civilian researcher and professor at West Point, developing analytics to help counter terrorist networks and insurgents. Today, he focuses on natural language processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that uses analytics to derive insights from unstructured text—that is, text that is not organized into a structured table but appears in written documents. These could be legal contracts, consumer complaints, social media—and, in one example, conversation logs between pilots and towers. “Almost 90 percent of all data is unstructured,” he explains. “We are just at the tip of the iceberg in developing potential applications.” What’s different now is that there are application programming interfaces (APIs), or new ways to access a vast variety of data across applications, and tools have advanced to allow more nuanced, granular, and accurate analysis of text. Luke recounts helping a company that had come through multiple acquisitions and inherited numerous sets of product data. They were using the same part number for vastly different parts and buying the same materials for different prices from different suppliers. “Their goal was simple: pay the lowest price point for the same part. We helped them rationalize their product portfolio by applying machine learning to analyze textual product descriptions—it wouldn’t have worked with SKUs or bar codes,” he said. In another example, a Southern US state was able to slice and dice reams of student data in a myriad of ways to tease out the socioeconomic factors that influenced test scores. They then could advise their school districts on the qualitative factors they had control over, such as teacher-student ratio, that could improve performance. Following next was Jack Zhang , who has been with the analytics group from its humble beginnings of Excel sheets and traditional statistical models. Today, he leads our work on AI-enabled feature discovery (AFD), which he describes as “boiling the ocean” to find the insights. AFD is about testing every possible variation on a set of information to understand outcomes, such as why customers cancel a service or patients make certain choices. “It’s a statistical-modeling concept that’s been around for years—but automation has changed everything,” he says. We can test every possible variation of immense data sets—hundreds of millions of variations—in a fraction of the time, and it highlights pockets of features we can dive into for new insights.” He walked through an AFD model designed for a wireless company that was struggling with a stubborn 20 percent annual customer-churn rate. The team helped them construct an airtight 360-degree view of millions of customers and then ran the algorithm—more than 300 features emerged that signaled when a customer was about to cancel their contract, such as moving into a specific zip code. The company could address most of them with three overarching preemptive measures, representing $100 million in possible incremental revenue. The model is being adapted across more than ten industries including media, banking, and pharmaceuticals. Adrija Roy , a geospatial expert, demoed our OMNI solution. It combines geospatial data (transit hubs, foot traffic, demographics) with customer psychographics (shopping history) and machine-learning techniques. Businesses are using OMNI to understand the economic value of each of their locations in the context of all of their channels. It’s guiding decisions on optimizing location networks, including opening and closing outlets and designing individual store experiences. The final demo was about deep learning, presented by Vishnu Kamalnath , an electrical engineer and computer scientist, who did early work training humanoid robots. In deep learning (DL), algorithms ingest huge sets of unstructured data, including text, audio, and video, and process them through multiple layers of neural networks, often producing insights humans or less complex models could not grasp. DL algorithms can detect underlying emotion in audio text, are used in facial recognition, and can track small, fast-moving objects in satellite imagery, such as fake license plates in traffic. In a recent example, working with a bank to reduce fraud, the team developed an algorithm that surfaced and analyzed a key feature of fraudulent signatures—tiny blots created when a nervous, often inexperienced perpetrator faked a signature. They used the algorithm to test all of the existing signatures on record, garnering a 97 percent rate of accuracy in detecting fraudulent ones. “People used to think of deep learning as a really expensive proposition, requiring complex hardware,” says Vishnu, “But the cost is dropping; tools are becoming commoditized. Don’t shy away from it as an esoteric solution.” Deep-learning applications are estimated to be $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in value annually across 19 industries. While technologies are advancing at a healthy pace, one challenge remains unchanged: getting right kind of data for the right use case at the right time. “The data component takes 80 percent of the time to gather, clean, and run in any project,” says Jack Zhang. “We still live by the maxim ‘garbage in, garbage out’.” related Five Fifty: Real-world AI An executive’s guide to AI Analyze this, data scientists Never miss a story"

Want to reinvent your business? Start with culture,Looking to reinvent your business?  Start with culture. That&rsquo;s one of the key takeaways from the inaugural Brainstorm Reinvent meeting.,2018-10-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/want%20to%20reinvent%20your%20business%20start%20with%20culture/fortune-kevin-hero_1536x864.jpg,"Innovation,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/want-to-reinvent-your-business-start-with-culture,"Want to reinvent your business? Start with culture Kevin Sneader, McKinsey global managing partner, kicked off the inaugural Brainstorm Reinvent conference in Chicago, which we co-sponsored with Fortune. The focus of the event: managing the tremendous changes required for continuous innovation. October 4, 2018 Last week, McKinsey and Fortune brought together more than 150 senior executives for the inaugural Brainstorm Reinvent conference, held in Chicago. The participants—representing organizations young and old, digitally native and digitally transitioning—were there to exchange ideas and lessons they’ve learned as their organizations undergo massive shifts created by technology and innovation. The most-discussed learning: the key to successful reinvention is culture. McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader kicked off the event by reminding executives of the need to continually reinvent their companies. He cautioned against becoming complacent when powerful trends like digitization take longer to bear fruit than anticipated. Kevin used the analogy of the transition from sailing ships to steam ships. Steam power took decades to completely overtake sailing, he explained. Meanwhile, rather than innovate, some ship builders continued to simply try to build a better sailing vessel, often by adding more sails. They became obsolete and missed the chance to become part of the new era of steam. McKinsey helped Fortune innovate its own conference format, presenting four new “master classes” which interwove our expertise with stories shared by executives leading digital initiatives. The discussions revealed that the oft-held notion of competition between digital natives vs incumbents is simply not true, as executives demonstrated again and again their dependence on each other to thrive. In one segment, Mark Johnson, cofounder of a small New Mexico–based data-science shop called Descartes Labs, appeared alongside James Weed, head of global analytics at 153-year-old Cargill, to talk about how their firms are working together to use geospatial analytics to optimize agricultural supply-chain activities. Mark later noted “McKinsey’s master class offered tech start-ups like mine a rare opportunity to see the frameworks larger companies use to think about how to deploy AI; it can help smaller tech firms hone their research and offerings.” While the conference highlighted tech and innovation, culture change dominated the conversation, as attendees universally acknowledged that it is the most difficult nut to crack as organizations digitize. Edith Cooper, former global head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, said the financial-services giant couldn’t have executed on its strategy to move into new markets if it weren’t for its “culture of exploration, innovation, and risk taking.” Siemens CEO Barbara Humpton spoke about how her company sought to create an “ownership culture” to empower employees to find innovative ways to use digital technologies. The list of references to culture’s paramount importance could go on. Tech firms recognize that they aren’t immune to culture challenges just because they cut their teeth on innovation. As noted by Frances Frei, the Harvard Business School technology and operations management professor who helped Uber address its cultural woes: “If you’re born for innovation but neglect the people, bad things will happen.” Several executives shared the ways they rallied their employees to embrace digital  cultures:  organizing town halls, realigning incentives, and creating a fail-fast culture, which Sam Yagan, former CEO of dating-site titan The Match Group and current CEO of ShopRunner, said he achieved by making business leaders at Match quantify their failures—and celebrate them. In McKinsey’s master class on culture change, senior partner Chris Gagnon shared additional innovation accelerants such as flattening organizational hierarchies, aggressively reallocating budget to growth areas, and personalizing talent strategies. Yet, as Chris and others noted, little will work in the absence of a strong company vision in which technology, innovation, and employees are all in sync. WW (formerly Weight Watchers) CEO Mindy Grossman urged executives to “relentlessly use your purpose filter.” ESPN’s executive vice president of content, Connor Schell, noted that the sports entertainment company grounds innovation and everything it does in the company’s original purpose of telling great stories and connecting with fans. As the conference closed, executives noted that the quality of the takeaways made the event stand out from others they’ve attended—and likely to spur even more reinvention. related Welcoming Aberkyn, a firm of change facilitators, to McKinsey Culture for a digital age Never miss a story"
Generation receives 2018 WISE Award for innovation in youth employment,Generation wins 2018 WISE award for its innovative youth employment program.

Every year, the WISE awards recognize six projects that provide innovative solutions to pressing education challenges around the world, from youth unemployment to the refugee crisis to entrepreneurship in disadvantaged communities. While most youth-employment programs focus on a particular country or sector, Generation’s ambition is global and multisector, and its impact on unemployed youth and on employers has been significant. Chosen from 413 applicants, it is the only workforce-skills-related program to receive an award this year, and it is a particular honor because most winners have long track records while Generation has accomplished a great deal in less than 4 years. Generation addresses the needs of employers and unemployed young adults Today, more than 75 million young adults are out of work globally, and three times as many are underemployed. At the same time, 40 percent of employers say a skills shortage is leaving them with entry-level vacancies. Generation has the dual mission to empower young people to build thriving, sustainable careers and to provide employers with the highly skilled, motivated talent they need. Generation is a demand-driven program, meaning that the team focuses on identifying employers who need talent and are having difficulty finding it and that it prepares a qualified supply of trained graduates. In its first 3 years, Generation has worked with thousands of employer partners and has launched careers for more than 22,000 young adults across the world. Prudential Insurance gets a better ROI on sales recruits Prudential in Kenya had a recruiting problem. For years, Prudential would bring in large numbers of recruits and spend time and energy training them as insurance salespeople, but they had a very low success rate. “People would come in … masses. We’d take them through the business opportunity and how to go out and sell. But out of that big group, we’d soon be left with only three or four people,” shares Julius Mulera, a manager with Prudential Life Insurance  in Kenya. Generation has helped Prudential solve that problem in a few important ways. Generation graduates are equipped to start selling insurance products from day one, thanks to the practical skills taught in the programs through simulations and role plays. They already know what the job entails and are ready to stay for the long haul. And they perform better, too—the typical Generation graduate closes one sale for every five customers they approach—compared with one in 20 for other agents, a huge improvement. Young adults are prepared to succeed and vastly improve their earning power More employer-supported programs mean more training and placement options for students. Isabel is a university graduate in Spain who studied tourism. Like many peers in her region, she had a degree, but not the skills that employers sought. She had applied to 20 jobs over 6 months by the time she came to Generation. She joined the robotic-process-automation (RPA) program 1 year ago. This was a profession that she did not even know existed, and she initially thought that she needed to have a math or engineering background in order to do well. Seven weeks later, she graduated and was employed by a financial institution. She is earning a salary of €22,000 per year and has a permanent contract. RPA is a growing need for businesses across sectors, but since it’s a new kind of role, employers are facing challenges finding qualified candidates. Generation’s innovative approach continues to fuel the organization’s expansion With the help of innovations like new ROI tools to measure the cost per hire, and the validation of the WISE award, Generation is well poised to continue to grow—with plans to soon expand to five new countries.

New research highlights gap between race and earning power in the US: Meet the authors,McKinsey delivers findings of research into earning potential of black families and role of philanthropy in community. Here&rsquo;s what we learned.,2018-10-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20research%20highlights%20gap%20between%20race%20and%20earning%20power%20in%20the%20united%20statesmeet%20the%20authors/blog-bef-jason-hero_1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-research-highlights-gap-between-race-and-earning-power-in-the-united-states,"New research highlights gap between race and earning power in the US: Meet the authors Jason Wright, McKinsey partner, presents our philanthropy research findings at the Black Economic Forum. October 22, 2018 McKinsey recently released the results of our first-time research about the earning potential of black families in the United States. The findings were presented to 200 prominent leaders at the first Black Economic Forum (BEF) in late summer. We served as the knowledge partner for the event, hosted by the Executive Leadership Council (ELC), and Beta Iota Boulé , both of which work to advance black leadership. Shelley Stewart and Jason Wright , McKinsey partners, co-led the initiative. Shelley explains: “We talked about researching a number of issues—criminal justice, poverty, community organizing—but ultimately concluded the most valuable thing we could do was to create a fact base about exactly how the black community makes, saves and invests its money— or creates wealth—and to dig deep on the root causes of why there is such a disparity compared to other racial groups.” As an example, almost 70 percent of middle-class black children are likely to become poorer as adults, compared with 34 percent of white children. The team also looked at how to better deploy philanthropic dollars, using ways that we have seen work effectively in other communities. The goal of the BEF event was to come away with a tangible set of initiatives to improve the job opportunities for young blacks, strengthen the earning potential of families, and improve philanthropic support within communities. For Jason Wright, this work was a “labor of love.” Here are excerpts of a recent interview with him and Shelley. What was the inspiration for this project? Jason Wright: It started two years ago. We had organized the 25th anniversary celebration of the firm’s black consultant group, now known as McKinsey Black Network (MBN). The event included 150 colleagues and alumni, black leaders and executives, members of the ELC, and our managing partner Dominic Barton. There was a panel, led by James Manyika , and including the CEO of BET Networks, the head of Baltimore City Public Schools, and Susan Rice, former national security advisor. They all shared their life stories, how they got to where they are today, and the overwhelming challenges they saw ahead, particularly the lack of a pipeline of upcoming black leaders.
We knew it was important to understand exactly where black families—and communities—were in terms of earning potential—and to quantify the related economic,  political, social and educational factors. How was the research conducted? Shelley Stewart: A team of five McKinsey colleagues worked full time over several months analyzing publicly available data from think tanks, the census, and the Bureau of Labor  plus McKinsey Global Institute data about the future of work and automation. We then conducted more than 50 interviews with private-, public-, and social-sector leaders to create a picture of a “middle-class black-family journey” as they worked to accumulate wealth over time. We also looked at the philanthropic landscape and mapped out which kinds of solutions—for example, reskilling, financial literacy—would have the greatest effect. What jumped out at you from the findings? Shelley Stewart: A few things. It starts with geography: the fact that 60 percent of black families are concentrated in metropolitan regions that we define as “declining”—a combination of low growth and low wages. So location immediately limits opportunities. And it continues across all factors. A typical middle-class black family has a 55 percent lower household income; black workers are underrepresented in seven of the eight highest-paying industries; black families are six times as likely to be “unbanked.” It goes on. Jason Wright: What sticks with me is that as we look at the black corporate executives, they are overwhelmingly in support positions—HR, communications, diversity—that don’t often feed into business-leadership roles. For a dwindling pipeline, this is serious but actionable, and we as a firm have strategies for this. But when you also consider that the minority workforce is overrepresented in the jobs most at risk for automation , such as healthcare, factory operations, food service, it becomes a burning platform. My two older kids are in nursing and health administration. In terms of political influence, black people are underrepresented at all levels of government compared to the general population. At the federal level, only 9 percent of elected officials are black; at the state level, 8 percent; and at the local level, only 5 percent of the people who make the decisions about our everyday life—our parks, schools, safety—are black. Shelley Stewart: So clearly these facts add up to a pretty bleak picture. And that’s what we saw at BEF this summer. As people reviewed the findings, presented in a walk-through gallery, they intuitively knew this was what they had experienced growing up and in their own lives, but they had never seen facts so coherently put together. There was a lot of sorrow that first day. Can you talk a bit about the philanthropy findings? Jason Wright: What we found is that although the black community has the lowest median income and wealth of any ethnic group, they donate 1.6 to 4.0 times more than other demographic groups. And 60 cents of every dollar for social causes goes to churches or religious institutions, not to their community organizations. So we see a real opportunity for financial education for church leaders in their role as stewards, so they can grow this money and benefit their communities. More than 20 initiatives came out of the meeting. Which ones would you like to see come to life? Jason Wright: I would like to see the creation of a capability-building organization for black executives and entrepreneurs. It could focus on both hard skills, such as analytics and automation, and soft skills, such as how to secure funding, develop institutional support for initiatives, grow talent. It could become a world-class training destination for the next generation of black leaders, something that Shelley Stewart has laid the groundwork for in our annual C-suite Academy offering . But there were so many good ideas—and some hard thinking to do to choose the right ones to focus on as a firm. related A passion for diversity starts early, at home Never miss a story"
How do you quantify the magic of design? Our experts explain,Our new research shows that companies can design their way to a better bottom line. We identify four critical design practices.

Our experts explain Marcus Fairs, editor-in-chief of Dezeen, moderates a panel on the business value of design with McKinsey Design Partners Ben Sheppard and John Edson, along with Airbnb Design Director, Jenny Arden. October 29, 2018 Looking for 32 percent more revenue than your peer organizations? How about 56 percent greater total shareholder return? Over a 5-year period, companies that excelled in design reported these kinds of financial results. “Many designers have believed in the business importance of design for years,” says partner Ben Sheppard , who led this first-time research initiative, “However, this is the first time we can quantify the impact of design on growth and shareholder return. This elevates the designer’s conversations with their business peers. Design is now firmly a C-suite topic.” Ben grew up on a houseboat on London’s Thames River and, for as long as he can remember, wanted to be an inventor. He’s brought his passion for new ideas to his work at McKinsey, where he founded the firm’s Design-to-Value Lab in London. The Lab uses a process of taking apart products to find ways to improve them. He then became involved in growing the firm’s Design Practice ,  including integrating design firms LUNAR and Veryday. Ben and engagement manager Garen Kouyoumjian are the lead authors of the new McKinsey report The business value of design with senior partner Hugo Sarrazin and expert associate partner Fabricio Dore as coauthors. For this project, the team followed the fortunes of 300 companies, across industries, over a 5-year period; they tracked both design actions and financial performance. The results show the strong correlation between design best practice and improved financial return. They also show that out of the hundreds of design actions a business leader can take, there are four that matter most. “I personally wondered if the results would be linear, if we would find that every dollar put into design adds more value,” says Ben. But instead of seeing incremental gains, the team found that companies that do certain design projects very well disproportionately outperformed their peers. When it comes to getting the most from design, “It’s all about moving into the first quartile. You can start by picking one project—a product, service, experience, or app—but do it properly, or don’t do it at all. Your customers need to recognize you as the best out there to get the rewards.” The new report is an expansion of research published last year by Ben, Garen, and design partner John Edson. The positive response to this initial research encouraged them to expand the data set in the hope of finding statistically significant evidence for design’s bottom-line contribution. “Doing this at McKinsey made sense, because we’re able to combine our creative capabilities on the design side with the firm’s strategic thinking and analytic prowess,” says Ben. Past quantitative research on the value of design has been limited, in part because designers themselves have been reluctant to quantify their impact. “Everyone in design implicitly knows that there’s value in it, but we’re also very averse to putting it to numbers,” says Garen, a former designer himself. There’s a sense of design as a creative art, so some designers fear that quantifying it makes it seem like something anyone can do. Ben concurs: “Designers have sometimes been their own worst enemy,” he says. By not prioritizing more rigorous quantification and being reluctant to own the business-case conversations, they’ve inadvertently created artificial silos, and as a result, their voices haven’t been heard by business leaders. The silos are beginning to break down. “We set out to make design accessible to business leaders, to get design a seat at the table,” Garen says. They also wanted to ensure that designers have business needs in mind when developing products and services. “In the end,” Garen says, “achieving excellence in design is no more difficult than other big business opportunities. The difference is that the value of others has been quantified for a long time.” To help as many companies as possible quantify the role of design, the team is publishing a public survey tool , built by Fabricio, in tandem with the research. The survey will allow companies to evaluate their own design success and benchmark it against the 300 companies. Garen adds, “Our research findings apply wherever you are. The benefits you get from good design are not limited to the obvious disciplines, such as fashion or consumer products, but have power across industries as varied as healthcare, financial services, and industrial manufacturing.” As for the significance of the research within the context of our client work, Ben says, “If, at the core of your business, you don't have an amazing product or service, everything else is filler. We aspire to help our clients solve the world's most complex and important design problems to delight users, stand out from the competition, and create growth.” related New day for Veryday New faces at McKinsey Design: A Q&A with Collin Cole Designers at McKinsey—vive la différence!

November 13, 2018 The winner of this year’s Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award affirms the wisdom of the idiom “too good to be true.” Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup , by John Carreyrou, chronicles the meteoric ascent and crash of Theranos, the blood-testing company that touted near-magical diagnostic technology that turned out to be bunk. Kevin Sneader, managing director of McKinsey, and Lionel Barber , editor of the Financial Times and chair of the judging panel, presented the awards last night at the National Gallery in London. Charlotte Hogg, CEO, Visa Europe, gave the ceremony’s keynote address. “ Bad Blood is a distinctive piece of work,” said Sneader. “There are lessons here about the importance of governance and the proper trade-offs between fostering innovation and conducting due diligence. Above all, it combines deep reporting with the narrative pulse of a well-told detective story.” Lionel Barber said, “ Bad Blood is a brilliant piece of enterprise journalism. Carreyrou cracked the story of Theranos despite threats. He just gives us the facts and they are devastating. It’s well written and reads at times like a thriller.” Carreyrou, a reporter at the Wall Street Journal , was first alerted to a Theranos by a tip from a reader. After legal threats against him and his sources, he broke the story in a front page exposé in 2015. Theranos soon became the subject of intense scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors, and patients who had received incorrect test results. “I hope that people read this book and keep in mind that this Silicon Valley playbook doesn't apply very well to regulated industries and especially doesn’t [apply] when lives are at stake,” Carreyrou said in his acceptance speech. Since the book’s publication, Theranos announced that it would dissolve and return any remaining cash to creditors. The judging panel spent Monday deliberating the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. Judges for the award included Lionel Barber, Financial Times editor and chair of the judging panel; Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman at Mozilla; Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz; Herminia Ibarra, professor of organizational behavior at London Business School; Randall Kroszner, professor of economics at University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Dambisa Moyo, global economist and author; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Rik Kirkland, our head of global publishing at McKinsey. For the fifth time, we presented the Bracken Bower Prize to the best proposal for a business book by an author under 35. This year’s winner was Andrew Leon Hanna, for his book proposal 25 Million Sparks , which examines the rise of refugee entrepreneurs in a global crisis. It beat entries from 22 countries on topics ranging from technology to gender to the ethics of business. Past winners of the Bracken Bower Prize have gone on to publish books based on their proposals, including 2014 winner Saadia Zahidi, 2015 winners Chris Clearfield and András Tilcsik, and 2015 finalist, Irene Sun. The Business Book of the Year Award is given to the book that provides “the most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues, including management, finance, and economics.” Since 2005, the prize has shortlisted 83 books that comprise a thorough overview of business in a tumultuous era.

"Meet Acha Leke, author of a new guide to succeeding in business in Africa","Acha Leke talks about the inspiration for his new book on Africa, and the early personal and work experiences that shaped his outlook.",2018-11-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/meet%20acha%20leke%20author%20of%20a%20new%20guide%20to%20succeeding%20in%20business%20in%20africa/acha-leke-leadspace-2_1536x864.jpg,"Our Publishing,Africa",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-acha-leke-author-of-a-new-guide-to-succeeding-in-business-in-africa,"Meet Acha Leke, author of a new guide to succeeding in business in Africa Acha Leke, senior partner and chairman of McKinsey’s Africa office, co-authored a new book with Georges Desvaux, senior partner, and Mutsa Chironga, a former McKinsey partner and now an executive of Nedbank. The title is  Africa’s Business Revolution: How to Succeed in the World’s Next Big Growth Market. November 20, 2018 With more than 400 companies doing $1.0 billion in revenue, $1.4 trillion in consumer spending, and an average age of 19, Africa offers big business opportunities. So just how can you do it? We sat down with Acha Leke , senior partner and chairman of McKinsey’s Africa office, and coauthor of Africa’s Business Revolution: How to Succeed in the World’s Next Big Growth Market (Harvard Business School Press, November 2018), to find out what it takes to successfully do business in Africa. Could you tell us about where you grew up? I was born in Cameroon. My family left when I was about six months old for Montreal and returned to Cameroon’s capital city, Yaoundé, when I was about ten. I attended high school in Belgium, and college and graduate school in the US. It was during grad school at Stanford that I decided to do a summer internship with McKinsey in Johannesburg. At the end of my PhD, I rejoined the firm full-time in the Atlanta office, then transferred back to Johannesburg 2.5 years later. What would you say about your upbringing that has shaped your outlook now? When my parents finished their graduate studies in Canada—my dad is a gynecologist and my mom is an immunologist—they took the next plane home to put their new skills to good use for their country, Cameroon.  I finished grad school in the 90s, and it was such a tumultuous time in Africa, that no one was going back.  People were saying, “We’ll only return when things change.” But I felt that those of us who were fortunate enough to have received an education overseas had a responsibility, and even an obligation, to come home and create the change we so badly wanted. When you started with McKinsey, there was only one office in Africa. What was it like as the firm expanded across the continent? When I moved to the continent, the firm had 50 people based in Jo’burg. I was excited about the work we were doing in South Africa , but the rest of the continent also needed a lot of help, and there were lots of ways we could contribute as a firm. I was an engagement manager at the time, and I shared my aspiration to help expand our footprint across the continent with the six partners in the office. Three said, “Spend your time on other things, and you’ll be elected partner.” The other three said, “If that’s what you want to do, we’ll help you.” So I decided to follow my passion. You’ve worked on some big projects. Which one is your favorite? One project in Uganda stands out. Uganda had the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world in the early 2000s. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs had just come onto the market, but they cost $700 per person per month, while the average person in Uganda made $300 per year. Pharmaceutical companies were under a lot of pressure to reduce these prices, especially in emerging economies, but they were worried these drugs could end up smuggled into their core markets. We went to Kampala to work on how to secure the distribution channels—and this evolved into how to strengthen the country’s health system. They didn’t at the time have enough capacity to manage a huge increase in people receiving these drugs, and we helped them figure out how to do that. We presented our work to a group of pharmaceutical CEOs along with WHO [World Health Organization] and UNAIDS [the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS], and a few months later, they dropped the prices of these drugs by 90 percent. I’ll never forget that work. When we started, there were less than 10,000 people on ARVs. At the end of the year, after we were done, they were up to 70,000 people. What inspired you to write this book? We’ve been writing a lot of reports on Africa, and people have been encouraging us to write a book. A colleague suggested that we give it a go: “Let’s write a concept note and send it to publishers and see if they’re interested.” Turned out, they were. In this book, we build on our research and the 3,000-plus projects we have done in Africa. Most of our past reports focused on the what: Where is the opportunity? Which sectors? Which countries? But this book focuses on the how: How do you build a profitable and sustainable business on the continent? How did you and your coauthors come together? Mutsa [Chironga] wrote a lot of the MGI [McKinsey Global Institute] reports with me. Georges [Desvaux] ran the firm in Africa at the time. He had also spent 7 years in Japan and 7 years in China, so he had a unique pattern recognition across geographies. Why do you think there was such a demand for this book? The publishers told us that they’ve been looking for a real guidebook on business in Africa. A lot of our earlier reports focused on making the case for why people should take Africa seriously. Our 2010 report “Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies” did this, and it actually won an award at the World Bank/IMF [International Monetary Fund] spring meetings as the initiative that best promoted Africa as an investment destination that year. Our next set of reports were once again focused on identifying and sizing the business opportunity across countries and sectors. It was time for the next step: If you’re in business, what do you need to do to succeed on the continent? Now that the world has for the most part bought into the Africa opportunity, the big question is how to capture it. That’s what the book is about. Were you surprised by anything in your research? We interviewed 40 senior business and development leaders, built on MGI’s proprietary research, and studied over 20 successful companies in Africa, from multinationals to start-ups, etc. The biggest theme that we found was that the companies that do well in Africa were the companies that address a fundamental societal need. Companies that come in not only because they want to make money but also because they really want to help solve a real problem—whether it’s access to affordable electricity or that financial services are made available to a broader segment of the population. This mind-set, this ethos, is critically important. Is this a difficult mind-set shift for people? I think you either have it or you don’t. It was apparent that the companies and the people we interviewed came to try and help solve a key problem on the continent. They see problems as opportunities. And from that they’re able to build durable and profitable businesses. Companies in Africa actually tend to grow faster and are more profitable than their peers around the world, because once you get the business model right, it’s actually more difficult for folks to come in and try to replicate it. What do you think the biggest challenge will be for business in Africa over the next decade? The thing with Africa is that no matter where you look, there are challenges from its lack of infrastructure and challenges in the business environment, due to the small size of many markets and concentration in some sectors. On the flip side, if you look at it through an opportunity lens, you see that it has the youngest population in the world—the median age is 19—it’s fast growing, it’s urbanizing rapidly, and technology is transforming everything. In this context, the companies that win will need to take a long-term perspective. So the biggest challenge, in my mind, is for companies to understand this, be willing to ride through the short-term volatilities—and there will be many—while keeping their eye on the overall prize. related Towards a more efficient frontier for Africa Lions on the move II: Realizing the potential of Africa’s economies Never miss a story"
"Meet Pal Erik Sjatil, regional managing partner for Europe","Pal Erik offers personal and professional reflections on the outlook in Europe, including opportunities for innovation and the challenges of reskilling.",2018-11-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/meet%20pal%20erik%20sjatil/pal-erik_leadspace-sm_1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Europe",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-pal-erik-sjatil-regional-managing-partner-for-europe,"Meet Pal Erik Sjatil, regional managing partner for Europe November 29, 2018 Earlier this year, Pal Erik Sjatil became McKinsey’s regional managing partner for Europe and relocated from Moscow to Paris. Born and educated in Norway, Pal Erik joined McKinsey in 1998. Before taking on the new role, he was managing partner for Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa  (2014–18) and earlier led our Oslo office (2007–10) and our offices in Eastern Europe (2010–14). He works with clients across the high-tech, telecom, financial-services, and energy sectors. We sat down with Pal Erik in Paris to learn more about him and to hear his perspective on the outlook for European business. Why Paris? Paris is very much the center of Europe geographically. It is so convenient to live in Paris if you want to cover Europe. It’s a two-hour train ride to London, one hour to Brussels, two hours to Amsterdam, three hours to Frankfurt. Of course, it is a nice city. You can walk everywhere. The food is good. It’s an easy life, if anything. I don’t speak French, so from that perspective maybe you could say it is a bit silly. But for this job, Paris is a great hub to be in. What is the mood among European business leaders? Meeting CEOs and then reading the media is like different worlds, quite frankly. You get more optimistic when you meet the CEOs. The world economy is growing quite nicely. Europe is well positioned for many of the opportunities. For example, growth in Asia and the increasing importance of Asia in the global economy is a huge opportunity [for] Europe. Europe is close to Asia—even connected. And European companies have done a good job creating products for these fast-growing economies: everything from luxury goods to industrial products to cars. All CEOs want to talk about geopolitics. All CEOs find the [geopolitical] landscape complex. They do worry. On the other hand, it has not hit their businesses as much as you might think. Again, if you read the media you might think the situation is very difficult, but if you discuss it [with CEOs] you find that they are concerned mainly about the outlook. The fundamentals today are pretty good. Can Europe win in high tech? I think what happened in Europe in high tech was the result of complacency first and foremost—complacency at the companies and complacency at a European level, including the EU. When complacency sneaks in, the pace of innovation slows. We must not be complacent. We need to be bold, particularly when we see big technology shifts. If you look at many innovations [in technology], they are still happening in Europe. Take the Nordic countries as an example. We have always been extremely early in things like mobile technology and internet banking. Actually, I have never been in a bank branch in the Nordics—never, and I’m 46! We didn’t do this even when I was young. Our challenge in Europe is how to scale best practice. When we have something innovative, how do we make sure we are quicker at sharing best practice across Europe? What are the big challenges facing Europe? When you think [about] automation and advanced AI [artificial intelligence] technologies, and how fast they are being deployed, we need to have an answer on what to do with the workforce. CEOs are comfortable with deploying AI—they know how to do it, they are prepared to do it. Their biggest issue is what we do with the people. Yes, deploy the technology, but at the same time take a very bold approach to reskilling. As a CEO you have a huge responsibility to the capital markets. You need to deliver your earnings, profits, and dividends et cetera. But there is also a social responsibility. In this case, they can go hand in hand because if you do good reskilling [of your workforce] you can grow. One thing European CEOs need [to] focus on is growth. Just cutting costs will not take you where you want to go. Tell us about your family? I am married, to Maja, and we have three kids. My wife has worked for most of the time we have been together. When we had small kids, we lived through all the dual-career challenges that I hear younger colleagues talking about. Often, I took the kids to kindergarten in the morning. Maja would pick them up in the evening. Working through this puzzle every day wasn’t easy. Of course, now the kids are older; they don’t want to spend time with me anymore! Why did you join McKinsey? I was a student at a school called NTNU [Norwegian University of Science and Technology], a technical university in Norway. I am a master of science. McKinsey was not a natural choice for me. The honest truth is that I went through the interview process to learn how to be interviewed. To my surprise, I was asked to go to a second round and was interviewed by Wilhelm Mohn and Hugo Maurstad, senior partners at that time in the Oslo office. On the one hand, they were difficult interviews. On the other, they were very convincing about McKinsey as a place. Afterward, I was very keen to join. The next morning, I got a call with an offer, and I just said yes. related What’s next for McKinsey? A conversation with new global managing partner Kevin Sneader Never miss a story"

It typically crunches through thousands of variations of crop, market, and geographic data for insights on yields, prices, and investment opportunities. ACRE clients include large farms, national governments, food companies, and agriculture-input businesses, such as seed and fertilizer producers. David Fiocco is one of the cofounders of ACRE, which started about three years ago. “We built it out of necessity as our teams struggled to collect information for clients,” he says. “To do an analysis on corn exports for a Sub-Saharan African country, say, would take weeks, as teams of experts would pore through documents from ministries of agriculture and academic reports and travel extensively to see farmers.” “Not only was it extremely laborious, but we struggled to feel like the data were truly comparable,” David remembers. Meanwhile, a data and analytics revolution has been stirring in the agriculture industry—allowing the use of new types of data never before available. Fast forward to today: we’ve just added 121 weather-data variables to the ACRE mix. “We can access terabytes of data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), plus data from private sources, using a near-real-time download system that we developed,” explains Ryan McCullough , the solution leader. The data are stored and transformed into usable formats, and include factors such as soil and atmosphere temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, and dew points. These values are available to within ten kilometers of any point in the United States and 20 kilometers of points around the world. With these new data, ACRE can analyze the many ways in which short- and long-term weather can influence outcomes for our clients. These results help them make decisions they could not make before. For example, midseason crop stress is a critical factor for wheat yield. Using a combination of precipitation and humidity data, our experts have created a proprietary agronomic index that can predict, with 96% accuracy, crop yields for durum wheat in North America two months before the crop is even harvested. In another scenario, ACRE can help predict drought in an upcoming season—an insight that can aid local relief agencies in effectively deploying resources. ...our experts have created a proprietary agronomic index that can predict, with 96% accuracy, crop yields... The ACRE team has doubled in size this year to more than 30 people, including data scientists, agronomic experts, and former commodity traders. Team members still collect information directly from farmers—such as data on production costs for more than 30 crops—including spend on seeds, fertilizer, and labor and yield levels—using a consistent global methodology. This information is combined with geospatial and commodity data sets, integrated with proprietary insights such as our cost curves, and analyzed through machine-learning models. “We’re able to predict yields and market prices with a high degree of accuracy,” Ryan explains. “We use these analytics most frequently in specialty crop markets, which are less transparent than highly traded commodities, to help clients both plan when to harvest their crops and, for food companies, identify the right time to buy ingredients for their manufacturing business. We can identify an average of 5 percent direct cost-savings potential.” “I haven’t had a client request in the past couple of years where ACRE wasn’t part of the value proposition,” says Lutz Goedde, a senior partner. “Within 24 to 48 hours, we can develop a client-specific analysis.” related Food for thought A Japanese partner working to feed the world Never miss a story"

December 12, 2018 Earlier this year, QuantumBlack (QB), the advanced-analytics firm we acquired in 2015, opened its first location in Latin America , in Brazil. This month, it is charting a new course—following their ‘north star’ to Montreal—and opening a Center of Excellence within Mila , the Montréal Institute of Learning Algorithms - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. The announcement was made last week at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference and included a packed agenda of events, panels, and recruiting gatherings to kick-off the initiative. Why Montreal?  It has the largest concentration of academic researchers in deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI). Canada is investing $1 billion dollars over 5 years in AI as the core of its national strategy for innovation, and Mila is at the heart of this effort.  It’s led by one of the three founding fathers of deep learning, Yoshua Bengio , a professor at the University of Montreal, who heads a team of 17 professors alongside 200 experts. They are are pioneering the development of AI applications for vision, speech, and language. The Mila ecosystem also includes 15 corporate labs and 30 venture-capital-backed start-ups. In addition to Mila, there are some 250 AI researchers at McGill University and the University of Montreal. Montreal holds a special place in the hearts of QB cofounder and chief scientist Jacomo Corbo and QB head of the Montreal office, Yves Boussemart : both previously studied engineering at McGill University and will be leading the new office. The goal is to build a team of up to 30 deep-learning specialists and data engineers within the first year, and up to 100 experts within 3 years.  As part of the distinctive Mila ecosystem, they will undertake research for clients; co-build reusable assets, such as tools, code, and techniques; and collaborate on pro bono work. The center will serve as a training ground for McKinsey clients and our own analytics community, and it will function as an integral part of our Canadian office. “QuantumBlack specializes in cracking new-to-the-world use cases—and using them in large-scale transformations to create major change for clients,” explains Yves. “The physical co-location gives us the chance to exchange ideas and to take part in the newest scientific advances in deep learning, so that we can applying leading-edge techniques to large real-world data sets. We can move from concepts and pilots to resilient systems and help our clients in critical ways.” QB has worked across life sciences, aerospace, finance, and natural resources—helping private- and public-sector organizations to detect fraud, understand the interactions of drugs and streamline research, and monitor city infrastructures to reduce pollution and improve safety.

Photo taken at Shatila Refugee Camp, October 2018 January 3, 2019 This past October, the vast Shatila refugee camp in southern Beirut echoed with an unusual sound: the crack of bat on ball. More than 40 Syrian children—most of whom had never heard of, let alone played, the game—were participating in a cricket camp. News travels fast in Shatila. The following day, 120 kids showed up, a quarter of them girls, navigating the narrow streets lined with spider webs of electric wires to reach the modest playground. The week-long camp, organized by the charity Capital Kids Cricket with help from a McKinsey team, was an early highlight for Richard Verity in his new job guiding Basmeh & Zeitooneh . Becoming the leader of a Lebanese relief organization for refugees is a significant departure for Verity, a partner based in the London office who specializes in advising oil and chemicals companies. But here he was, on a year-long leave of absence, cheering on young cricketers as he plotted how to help an NGO run largely by refugees themselves become more effective. Verity’s journey to Shatila began five years ago when a young colleague burst into his office full of urgent enthusiasm. “We have to do something around Syrian refugees,” he said. “He thought I might be a soft touch,” notes Verity, who had assisted on other firm-organized social initiatives. When Verity did some research, he realized the situation was more severe than most people realized. There are more than two million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, according to some local estimates, and while a variety of organizations already tend to their basic needs, there is an important gap: education. About 750,000 children of school age have been displaced into Lebanon by the Syrian crisis, most receiving no schooling for years. When Verity travelled to Shatila, he met Fadi Hallisso, a Syrian who had founded Basmeh & Zeitooneh (it means “smile and olive” in Arabic) in 2012 while studying to become a priest. The organization created community centers inside refugee camps where donors could provide programs ranging from microfinancing to vocational training to women’s workshops. In 2015, it opened the first school. Verity realized this was where McKinsey could help. Not only do some consultants have a background in education, but the firm for years has been assisting governments and aid groups in delivering education and training to people displaced by global conflicts. “This issue is very personal to a lot of us at the firm,” says Tarek Mansour , a senior partner in the Dubai office who is partly of Lebanese and Syrian descent. But aside from the humanitarian aspect, the refugee crisis has critical socioeconomic implications. “We need to change the conditions to ensure each individual gets the chance to succeed in life,” says Mansour. Verity was quickly convinced that Basmeh & Zeitooneh was the firm’s ideal partner. “Anyone who comes into contact with that organization returns changed,” he says. “They adopted us, in a way, as we adopted them.” Mansour and Verity partnered on a joint effort by McKinsey’s Dubai and London offices to support the organization. Over the past 4 years, firm-members have donated around $100,000 and the firm has given many times this in the form of pro bono contributions, including teacher training, curriculum development, and strategies for the organization’s initiatives. Verity joined Basmeh & Zeitooneh’s board and brought in new international partners. And when Hallisso decided to take a year-long sabbatical to pursue a master’s degree in the United Kingdom, Verity saw the opportunity to become even more involved. “I had always wanted to help manage an organization and to make a more direct social impact,” he says. “Basmeh & Zeitooneh is no longer just a group of volunteers working out of a church basement but an organization of some size and importance.” Since arriving in Beirut in October with his wife, Meike, Verity has been developing plans for turning the organization’s schools—there will be three by the end of February—into academic institutions with high standards. He is introducing new operating practices around finance, HR, and communications while helping the organization fine-tune its mission and raise funds. He’s also spending 6 hours a week studying Arabic so he can communicate with the local school’s young charges. The cricket camp—which may become a permanent Shatila cricket squad—has been just one of many poignant moments Verity already has experienced. A few months ago, at another refugee center, he watched hundreds of children coming out of their tents to attend school for the first time. Many were functionally illiterate when they began. “Two months later, they could read and write,” he says. But those on the ground are well aware they’ve only started to address the need. Helena Eccles , a consultant in McKinsey’s London office who helped organize the cricket camp, recalls a 13-year-old girl handing her a note, which she had written with the help of Google Translate, that said, “I want to enter school but they do not accept me, I am very sad.” There’s space for 750 children at the Shatila school, and a waiting list of 3,000.

The forecasts for synchronous and sustained growth coming out of Davos 2018 seemed a distant memory last week, as a more cautious, trending-gloomy mood settled over 2019’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. Last year, we were talking about repairing the roof while the sun shines. This year, it’s more about preparing for inclement weather. This was my first Davos as managing partner of McKinsey, and as the event concluded, I shared some thoughts in a “fireside conversation” with Rik Kirkland, our director of publishing. Here are the four themes that I took away and that are captured in the video: 1. AI, AI, AI. It was almost impossible to walk into any room in Davos and not hear someone talking about artificial intelligence (AI) in all its forms. Executives around the world are beginning their journeys to place data and analytics at the heart of decision making, and I had conversations throughout the week with several who wanted to know how we approach that subject and what they should be doing. Of course, these conversations brought with them complex questions, not all of them strictly business based. Questions like: What’s happening to privacy? Who owns the data?
Where’s the consumer in all of this? And will the digital divide between those who have access and those who don’t lead to a more unequal world? The companies who will ultimately be successful are those that find ways to lead on issues such as tackling data quality so analytics are meaningful and actionable, transitioning from “pilot purgatory” to fully scaled implementations, and delivering on the pace and scale required for continuous adult learning. 2. Geopolitics, tension, and trade. I spoke to dozens of CEOs last week, and I started each conversation with a simple question: “How’s business?” And the answer I got was pretty consistent: “You know, my business is pretty good. But I’m worried about everybody else’s.” My take: the underlying economics are actually still reasonably solid for most companies and sectors; however, the external environment is now more than background noise. It’s having an effect on how leaders are choosing to invest and to focus their teams. Tension between the world’s biggest economies was on the minds of all delegates, and there was a lot of talk about the potential impact on supply chains. One of our latest McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) reports, Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains , was a big part of the discussion on all sorts of panels. I urge you to read it. The report explains that, for the first time, emerging markets now make up 50 percent of the counterparties in global trade. While these markets are perhaps more optimistic about growth than many developed economies are, they face their own challenges as knowledge and technology replace labor as the critical sources of arbitrage in global value chains. 3. Good business is about more than just business. It’s clear that citizens are looking for leadership on climate change, inequality, and other social issues. A lot of discussions reinforced what we have learned in our own research, which is that one of the best ways to deliver growth and inclusion is to continue making progress globally on gender parity. Leadership is also needed on climate change. All the assumptions around global warming have, if anything, proven too optimistic. In fact, one of the week’s most memorable events was Sir David Attenborough’s impassioned and compelling speech that made it clear that “now’s the hour” to make a change, to set things right. As he observed, we are running out of time. 4. Jobs, reskilling, and retraining. A good general rule right now is that whenever a conversation about AI comes up, a conversation about jobs is sure to follow. That was especially true this week, as employers and policy makers all over the world look ahead toward the future of work and reskilling. MGI has covered this topic extensively, but one of the things that our conversations in Davos made real this week was just how much the relevant issues differ by industry. Here’s an example: a hospitality executive described the potential to move to self-check-ins at hotels, as airlines have, but did not expect a big reskilling need, given high employee turnover. But we also heard from a healthcare innovator, reliant on an aging supply-chain workforce with low turnover, who was wrestling with how best to get more midcareer employees to embrace new skills. These issues are complex. But managing this transition well , as we have written in the past, “ is not just a social good; it’s a competitive imperative .” I’ll close with a favorite CEO quote from the week, a line that captured the mood at this year’s Davos. “Last year, we were talking about repairing the roof while the sun shines,” the CEO said. “This year, it’s more about preparing for inclement weather.” For further reflections, watch these interviews with Reuters and Bloomberg . related Reflections from Davos 2018 Dispatches from Davos Never miss a story"
"From tracking poachers to boosting donations, AI works for social good",Michael Chui answers questions from our social media audience about how artificial intelligence (AI) is helping social good organizations.,2019-01-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/ai%20for%20social%20good%20ask%20the%20author%20with%20michael%20chui/ai-social-good-hero_1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/ai-for-social-good-ask-the-author-with-michael-chui,"From tracking poachers to boosting donations, AI works for social good AI is being applied in a wide variety of ways to improve overall quality of life, from saving endangered species, to diagnosing cancers, to aiding disaster relief efforts. January 31, 2019 Disaster relief, remote-healthcare diagnostics, tracking rhino poachers, upping student achievement—each of these disparate activities could get a big boost from artificial intelligence (AI). A recent discussion paper from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), “ Notes from the AI frontier: Applying AI for social good ,” lays out just how AI can help tackle some of the world’s most challenging social problems, analyzing 160 use cases. The good news: about one-third are already being used today. Still, there’s much more that can be done, both to implement these solutions and to fully understand the breadth of what they can do for social-good organizations. We gathered questions about this topic from our social-media audience around the globe for Michael Chui , an MGI partner based in McKinsey’s San Francisco office and one of the report’s authors. Watch the videos or read the transcripts below to get the inside scoop about actionable ways people can bring AI into their workstreams and organizations to help ameliorate social problems. What types of AI applications could have the most benefit for social good? —Dana in Australia Michael Chui: Now, first of all, what we found was there is a huge number of different applications. We looked at 160. They cover all of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. But at least some of the ones that we’ve analyzed that we think have a lot of great potential are the applications of computer vision. And that’s everything from disaster relief, where you might use satellite imagery in order to identify where there are passable roads, where there are emergent situations like a building coming down, to public health, where there is the ability to do remote diagnosis of everything from skin cancer to other types of diseases. Those are some of the applications where we see lots of potential. And in fact, one of the surprising things was you can deploy these AI technologies not only in these more complex types of data, imagery, et cetera, but even in good, old-fashioned databases. And that’s a place where sometimes nonprofits have lots of data, just in traditional databases. And applying AI to those databases results in some of the surprising things that we’ve seen nonprofits be able to do. Just even routing to make sure that people can get to the places of need more quickly and more efficiently. So there’s application all over the board. How can nonprofits prepare for the next wave of technological disruption? How can technologies be used to promote more ethical giving? —Beth in the United States Michael Chui: First of all, we did find in our research that many nonprofits and socially oriented organizations need to increase their capacity around technology, AI [artificial intelligence] in general. And perhaps some of the organizations which have this capability and have people who know those technologies can allow them to contribute their time and their expertise. The other thing that we know is that, in fact, for deep learning particularly, these organizations need more data—and to be able to access that will be incredibly important. And one of the other things that we discovered was these technologies are extremely general. And so, in fact, you can deploy AI in order to improve the types of offerings, the types of communications, and the targeting in order to actually do better fund-raising. So that’s at least one application of AI for nonprofits. What are the additional talent needs that AI might bring? Will we see more collaboration between sectors? —Rahul in the United States Michael Chui: So, certainly, I think one of the things that we discovered is a bottleneck to capturing more value from AI for social good is, in fact, making sure that we have the talent in place, particularly in these social-good organizations, in order to take advantage of AI. So we do think that it’ll basically need to be an all-of-the-above type of strategy. Sometimes you’ll be able to train people who are already in these organizations. Sometimes you’ll be able to hire them. Sometimes you’ll need to look for partners. And to the point about crossing sectors, I think we’ll see increasingly—and we hope we’ll see increasingly—the commitment of organizations, whether they be tech firms or other companies that actually have data science and AI capabilities, to allow and encourage their employees with those capabilities to give their time, to give their talents, to give their expertise to social-good organizations in furthering some of this important potential of AI to actually help the world and help the world’s citizens. What are some of the obstacles that need to be overcome to use AI for social good? —Jonathan in the United States Michael Chui: We identified a number of different obstacles, these bottlenecks, that have to be overcome. Chief among them, in many cases, is accessibility to the data that you need in order to train these AI systems. In many cases, that data exists. It’s just locked away. It might be locked away in a commercial organization that sees value in selling that data. It might be just locked away because of bureaucratic inertia. There are lots of things, lots of data within governments, for instance, which could be valuable for addressing some of these social-good challenges, and yet it just hasn’t been made available. So I think that’s one of the challenges that we’ve identified during our research. Another one is talent. We’ve talked about it before. But you do need people who have these skills, this expertise, this understanding in order to deploy these technologies. And they’re in short supply. They’re paid a lot in the for-profit realm. And so, how can we start to bring more of that talent to bear, more of that data to bear, in order to use AI for social good? And then, finally, there are a set of “last-mile” challenges. Not all of them actually have anything directly to do with AI. But whether it’s funding, whether or not it’s having connectivity in place, whether or not it’s just having the number of people in place that you need in order to effect change: you might have superior insight from AI, but unless you can change conditions on the ground, it’s actually not going to be able to move the ball forward in terms of social good. That said, the other thing we identified in our research: there is a set of risks. In fact, in the worst case, some of these applications of AI, if misused—either intentionally or unintentionally—could actually hurt the people that you’re trying to help the most. If you’re using AI in order to try to identify people who are vulnerable in one way or another, whether it be refugees or whether it be victims of some sort of violence or crime, that very same technology can be used by people who actually would otherwise cause those vulnerable people to have worse lives. And so there are a number of these other challenges, including implicit or explicit bias as a result of different challenges embedded in the training data that you use to design these systems. There are questions about privacy. All of those are real risks. The number-one thing you can do is try to identify what those risks are, right? That’s part of a risk-management approach. And then, for each one, there’s a different way to mitigate it. But as powerful as this technology is, we’ll simultaneously need to understand those risks and be able to mitigate them as well. How can we make sure that AI doesn’t pick up the same bad habits as humans? —Anne in the United States Michael Chui: Number one is it is a real challenge. And I think, actually, one of the things that perhaps is surprising is that oftentimes the way that bias gets introduced into these systems is not because the software engineer codes up rules that end up in the system. But rather, it’s implicit in the training data that’s used to create these systems. We talk about machine learning, but that’s actually a little bit confusing. The machine doesn’t run off, and go learn something, and come back. Actually, we train it. And we train it with data. The problem often is that the data actually incorporates bias within it. And then you do get systems that pick up “the bad habits”—maybe those of people but, more importantly, the bad habits that are incorporated in that data. There isn’t one straightforward way to guard against it. Number one is you actually have to understand what that bias might be—the thing that you want to protect against. What are the classes of individuals whose characteristics you want to make sure are not incorporated into your systems, in terms of their decision making? And then do some testing. Understand what the data is, and then understand the system that you’ve created and the models that you’ve created using those systems. And, in many cases, it can be helpful to have third-party validation of those models as well. So number one is just understanding, being very clear about the ways in which you don’t want bias to show up. Because, after all, actually, you do want certain types of bias in order to do classification. It’s the good type of discrimination you want to do. And then secondly, be able to test it—both in terms of the data that you have, the systems you’ve created—and it is often helpful to have third parties do some of that testing with you. How do we ensure AI systems meet our ethical standards? —Jackie in South Africa Michael Chui: The truth is these are powerful systems. In a certain sense, they are imbued with the values of the people who design and deploy them. And so, to a certain extent, this is not a technical problem at all. We do have to understand what our goals are when we design these systems and then be able to point these powerful tools in such a way that they’re actually solving those problems. One of the things that we identified as we looked at this research around social good is that AI and these technologies have tremendous potential for actually doing social good. But, number one: we have to intentionally focus on using these technologies to do so. And then also make sure in the implementation—in the actual work that we do with technologies—that they don’t exhibit some of the negative impacts, whether it’s bias, whether it’s violating privacy or discrimination, while we’re still trying to do social good. related Four experts show how AI solves real-world problems An executive’s guide to AI Never miss a story"

This marked our firm’s third year at the exhibition, the world’s largest for the mobile industry. In between sessions, client workshops, and a mini robot challenge for tech recruits, three of our attendees took a moment to share a few of their takeaways from the event. The ethics of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is like electricity: it’s transforming the way we live, and it’s lightning fast. AI technology is already being used to diagnose illness, detect fraud, and improve customer service. And according to Chris Wigley, a partner at our advanced analytics firm QuantumBlack , now is the time to make sure that the application of AI is ethical and fair. ""It was great to see the number of very tangible practices already underway across organizations around the world,"" says Chris. These practices include the creation of public-informed AI principles, the definition of appropriate transparency levels, and standardized AI-governance models. “As the use of AI grows, organizations need to sharpen their values on this topic,” Chris explains, “to the point that they can help guide practitioners as they consider ‘should we do X, or should we do Y?’ “Those decisions won’t always be easy or without tension, and that’s ok,” Chris adds. “But we owe practitioners a framework to think those decisions through.” Blockchain for supply chains “We think there are lots of opportunities to use blockchain for logistics in the coming years, but it’s still early days, ” says Brett May, a vice president in our Internet of Things practice. Any industry that needs a trusted intermediary to legitimize transactions, ownership, or provenance, Brett explains, stands to reap the greatest benefits. Still, Brett reminds us, blockchain isn’t an immediate solution to all of today’s logistics challenges. “From a technical standpoint, the transaction volume available in current technology is not yet enough for what most companies need at scale,” explains Brett. “This will change over time. We’ve already seen tremendous improvement in just five years, but it’s not sufficient just yet for large volume deployment.” Then there’s the issue around trust, which Brett says has less to do with the technology and its improved security and more to do with getting companies that handle expensive transactions to trust a blockchain distributed ledger. “It’s a total mind-set shift that’s coming for people in the logistics business,” says Brett. “They’ll have to trust that the distributed ledger will be reliable once there’s no longer a middleman to be held accountable. And that will just take some time for people to get used to.” Data analytics in healthcare Healthcare data are perhaps richer and more abundant today than ever. But according to McKinsey partner and telecommunications expert Harrison Lung , there has been a lack of an overall holistic view that could reveal insights hidden in that information. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unlocking medical data’s value,” Harrison says. Telcos, Harrison says, can play an important role in enabling better data sharing. “They can act as data brokers and convene the stakeholder community, the government, and other regulatory bodies,” he explains.  “And they can operate the analytics platform itself and integrate the various IT systems out there today.” Consumer devices that compile health data, including wearables, continue to rise in popularity. Harrison sees opportunities for data analytics to play a significant role in healthcare areas like R&D, prevention, diagnostics, and even insurance. “Think of Apple’s latest ECG feature on its watch,” says Harrison. “It can communicate with doctors who can intervene proactively and then activate stakeholders across an individual’s entire patient journey to ensure he or she gets the best care.” But Chris, Brett, and Harrison’s views are just a sample of the ideas our colleagues will bring back to clients and teams from an event that continues to expand with the industry it covers. “MWC has become much larger and broader than just telecommunications,” says Philipp Nattermann , a senior partner and expert in telecommunications. “It’s truly become the internet of things conference.” related Four trends from Mobile World Congress Picking up signals at Mobile World Congress Never miss a story"

According to our research , there’s often an added layer of complexity for women who take this journey: as they navigate careers working across male-dominated C-suites and boardrooms, many experience it as an “ only .” Being an only means being the only person like yourself in a given situation at work, usually because of your gender, race, or ethnicity (though it’s not limited to those qualities). It’s not an easy situation to thrive in. For instance, we’ve found that women working alone in a group of men are far more likely to have their judgment questioned, to be mistaken for someone more junior, and to be subjected to unprofessional and demeaning remarks. So, this International Women’s Day, we wanted to ask a few of our senior partner women: As leaders who have thrived amid this environment, what advice do you have for women around the world who are building their careers today? Here’s what they had to say. Lareina Yee , senior partner, San Francisco Form a personal board of directors. And of course, I don’t mean a literal “board,” but a small, trusted group of senior people both inside and outside your organization, who you both respect and admire and who can give you the advice and support you need over the course of your career. Your board shouldn’t be a group you turn to for tactical advice. Instead, this is a group that will help you set your aspirations high, challenge your thinking, and encourage you to do things that you’re maybe otherwise afraid to do. I started building my own personal board when I was just out of graduate school. I decided to keep in touch with a few of my old professors, and over the years they helped guide my thinking at certain inflection points. I’m still in touch with one of them, and it’s been amazing to see her career grow and change over time, just as mine has. To select your own board members, think about the  inspiring people you’ve met at work, people you feel a genuine connection with. Then, it’s on you to make the connection, stay in touch with them, and engage them when you need their help. Read Lareina’s feature in ‘Working Mother’ here. Clarisse Magnin-Mallez , senior partner, Paris Place joy and passion at the center of whatever you do. Don’t get anxious about what people perceive your abilities to be, and instead concentrate your energy on the joy and passion you get from your work, your clients, and your teams. This means learning how to silence your inner voices of doubt and to stop questioning every move you might want to make. Doing so can be hard, especially when things are perhaps going a bit tougher than you would like. But even then, try to focus on the moment at hand. Be yourself, be confident; your joy and passion will come through, making you extremely inspiring—and, in all likelihood, simply happy. Diaan-Yi Lin, senior partner, Singapore Be bolder, and don’t be afraid to ask for what you need. Especially early in my career, I often underestimated the license I had to operate and make independent decisions. As a result, I was reluctant to make bold moves, even when I felt sure they were the right thing to do. But as I began to take small steps forward, I began to see the goodwill and support that I had built over time. This helped me expand my comfort zone and gave me the confidence I needed to be much bolder in terms of what I would ask for and the way I set my aspirations. As your career advances, learn to see yourself the way others do, and to have the trust and confidence in yourself that others have in you. The sooner you do, the sooner you’ll begin having a greater impact on your organization, and more fun in your career. Liz Hilton Segel , senior partner, New York Be authentic. People often ask me: “Can I be myself and still be successful?” I think it’s important to get to know an organization’s style, and you need to be attuned to the environment that you’re in. But more than that, you need to know your own strengths, and you need to be authentic to who you are. Over time, you’ll get a feeling for the greatest attributes of your personality and leadership style. Be true to these things and amplify them to the forefront as opposed to trying to moderate them in the service of adhering to some other culture that isn’t who you really are. Take risks fearlessly. One of the things I’ve also noticed is that women who are offered new leadership roles are often quick to talk about their shortcomings or why they’re not qualified to take on that leadership role. Men seem to treat these opportunities in a completely different way. They’re often quite confident in their abilities, and they’re prepared to take the risk because they seek the new challenge. Especially for those of you out there who are early on in your careers, if you’re thinking about taking on a new risk, let me tell you: go for it. Figure out what your strengths are, build on them, and take risks that allow you to stretch yourself. Doing that will help you achieve as much as you could possibly imagine.

March 12, 2019 Any minute now, some speculate, workers around the world will be asked to make way for robots. Their arrival may be welcome in some cases. Our latest research suggests that when robots—or automated manufacturing technology—take over jobs that are oriented around repetitive tasks, operators are able to move onto more exciting and productive work. This was the case at 16 “ lighthouses of manufacturing ,” which were identified as part of a joint McKinsey and World Economic Forum project presented at Davos. It was conceived by Enno de Boer , a McKinsey partner and expert in digital manufacturing, as a way to help the growing number of companies—some 70 percent in a recent report —stuck in  “pilot purgatory,” unable to complete digitization experiments because of factors such as low funding or having an overly ambitious scope. The 16 lighthouses will be sharing their lessons and insights with peer manufacturers. So what is a lighthouse? According to the team, the term describes facilities so advanced in their use of digital tech, automation, analytics, and, yes, robots, that they stand out as beacons among their industry peers. To find them, the team reviewed 1,000 companies around the world over 2 years, developing 39 use cases, or operational criteria and success factors, that each facility would possess. Forty factories rose to the top, and the team visited most of them to create the final slate. Along the way, they got firsthand looks at a few eye-popping technologies, like an autonomous truck and train system, digital twinning and massive 3-D printing systems, and a single assembly line that every minute delivers one of seven different car models. And of course the team saw robots. Lots of them. But the technology in these cases was enhancing workers’ roles, not taking them. “Digitization is about improving productivity, not cutting costs,” Enno explains. “In most of the innovation we see at the lighthouses, the operator and workforce are leading the change and not subjected to it.” Adrian Widmer can attest to this. An engagement manager at our firm, Adrian visited ten companies in Europe as part of the project. “Saving a workplace that had been important for generations was the principal motivation behind digitizing the Procter & Gamble Rakona plant in the Czech Republic,” he said. According to Adrian, the plant was the main employer in Rakovník, a town of about 16,000 people, for more than 150 years. But not long ago, the market had shifted quickly, and the factory suddenly found itself under intense pressure to improve productivity. “The employees were passionate,” Adrian explains. “They told leadership: ‘This was where our grandfathers worked and where we want our grandchildren to work.’” So P&G started a program of testing and learning with digital technologies, launching modeling and simulation programs across all operations. It invited all of its operators and employees to think about what problems automation could solve and to identify opportunities that might give a boost to productivity. “They wanted to involve 100 percent of the organization in the transformation,” says Adrian. As a result, P&G upgraded its existing equipment with sensors and new software, including an industry-first, real-time quality-control system. In 3 years, it was able to increase output by 160 percent and customer satisfaction by 116 percent. “Because it’s now using leading technologies, it can also attract new talent in a very competitive market,” Adrian adds. “It expects to be operating for the next 150 years.” Elsewhere, Adrian spent time at the BMW factory in Regensburg, Germany. There, more than 2,000 robots perform different jobs, sometimes side by side with an operator. “In one case, the company found that people are actually better than any robot when it comes to installing the interior and engine of the car,” explains Adrian. But BMW also found that some of that work requires more strength than the typical worker might possess. So it devised a “co-roboting” system, where a worker’s ability is augmented by a machine. “The operator on the left side of the car guides the installation,” Adrian explains, “while also controlling a robot positioned on the right side, which can apply tremendous torque to complete the fit wherever needed. So strength is no longer a barrier to entry for this role,” Adrian explains. “It’s open to anyone with the right skills.” Diego Hernandez-Diaz , who’s also an engagement manager, visited five factories through the project. “I was really impressed by the lengths to which one electronics manufacturer went to help its people learn new skills,” he says. “It built out a fully-spec’d, virtual version of its factory. Employees would wear 3-D glasses to walk through and begin adjusting to their new jobs, even before the new technologies had been delivered.” Meanwhile, Asian manufacturers in certain markets are using advanced technologies to seize different opportunities. McKinsey senior expert Forest Hou visited eight plants across the region. In China, for example, demand for labor is high, and workers want to spend their careers at the forefront of their industries. “So leading companies are deploying wearable artificial-intelligence (AI) technologies,” says Forest, “to provide real-time feedback on worker performance and improve their effectiveness and skills, often in a matter of hours.” “Giving people access to data empowers them,” says Enno. “They touch screens, see what’s happening, identify reasons for quality deviation, and make decisions. Operators in nondigital factories don’t have this control. Your manager just hands you an ‘occasion’ report. Direct access to data democratizes the work process—and puts it in the hands of the operator.” That’s a familiar trend to firm senior partner Katy George . “Again and again,” she says, “we hear that the highest priority among the lighthouse leaders is upskilling their people.”
According to Katy, companies are assembling multigenerational workforces, bringing in new digital, data, and AI scientists to work alongside operators with more than 20 years of operational experience. They’re creating full-scale internal digital academies to keep their employees’ skills up to date. And several are establishing relationships with nearby high schools, community organizations, and local and state colleges to develop curricula that include on-site work experience. “At one electronics company, the first intern it had brought on later returned as the first graduate of its college program,” Katy says. And everyone around the Lighthouse Project agreed: if we can get the next generation that excited about a career in manufacturing, the future could be very bright indeed. related Davos 2019: Four big themes Never miss a story"
SXSW Interactive 2019: The big ideas that got us talking,"Flying cars, disruptive products and winning design are a few of the topics McKinsey experts shared at 2019 SXSW Interactive.",2019-03-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20secrets%20of%20yeethovens%20success%20and%20more%20lessons%20from%20sxsw%20interactive/sxsw-hero-column-width_1536x864.jpg,"Digital,AI & Analytics,Design",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/sxsw-interactive-2019-these-are-four-ideas-that-got-us-talking,"SXSW Interactive 2019: The big ideas that got us talking Robot-building exercise at McKinsey’s SXSW booth March 18, 2019 Seven McKinsey colleagues shared ideas that ranged from a deep-in-the-data look at AI to blue-sky thinking about flying cars at the 25th annual SXSW Interactive Festival in    Austin, Texas, last week. They were joined by more than 30 colleagues who flew in from five continents to connect with clients, chat with recruits, and catch glimpses of the future: the latest tech prototypes, products, and start-ups that will be shaping the way we live and work. Our firm is no stranger to the event. In fact, Collin Cole, an Austin local and McKinsey Design expert, has been actively involved with SXSW over the years as a sponsor and speaker. “The festival has mirrored the digital and design industries,” he says. “It’s always been a chance to explore and humanize each new wave of tech.” Here’s how our colleagues made the most of that chance this year. How healthy is your data? Collin said he thinks AI will dominate conversations at the festival for the next decade. It certainly did at the panel led by Kasia Chmielinski , a product manager with McKinsey Analytics . Joined by QuantumBlack legal counsel Alejandra Parra-Orlandoni , Government of Canada data and innovation director Ashley Casovan, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) research scientist Vikash Mansinghka, Kasia described new tools and frameworks being developed in both the public and private sectors to reduce bias in data. “Everyone is obsessed with ‘ethical AI’ and the bias in models,” Kasia explained. “But wait—the bias often comes directly from the data used.” Kasia would know. Prior to joining McKinsey, Kasia worked with a joint Harvard University and MIT team at the Berkman Klein Center to launch the Data Nutrition Project. “We interviewed 100 scientists about what they do before they create a data model,” Kasia explained. “There were 100 different answers—a free for all.” So the team developed a prototype that might increase transparency around data sets: the ‘Data Nutrition Label.’ “If you look at the contents of a candy bar, you might not eat it. This tool does the same for data: it tells you what’s inside the data set before your model consumes it,” said Kasia. Alejandra, who has a background as an engineer and naval officer, draws on her training as a lawyer to help QuantumBlack data scientists, risk experts, and consultants think through the implications of choosing different data sets to train AI models. For example, microtargeting populations to optimize a healthcare treatment or design a municipal service typically involves data sets that include sensitive information, like gender and age, as well as data that serve as proxies for sensitive categories, like zip codes for race. Any of these, Alejandra explained, could lead to harmful biases or unfair outcomes when leveraged by an AI model. In addition, diversity in the demographics and experiences of the team selecting the data sets  can also influence bias. “We know that more diverse teams are better at spotting problematic data or anticipating harmful outcomes that could arise by using certain data sets,” Alejandra pointed out. “The degree of public attention on the topic of data bias is fairly new—and very promising. We’re racing forward with developing a structured way of thinking about it and embedding tools and steps to mitigate the risks into our client-service protocols up front.” A disciplined way to create disruptive products Dan Chuparkoff always thought he’d be an architect, but after seeing an early version of computer-aided design (CAD), he decided that it’d be easier to change the world with software than with buildings. At McKinsey, he leads teams that create healthcare-analytics solutions. This was his fifth time as a speaker at SXSW. In a packed workshop, Dan walked an audience of software designers, product managers, and engineers through the concept of artificial neural networks , a branch of machine learning. Using decks of cards and red/green stickers, each member of the audience acted as a neuron in their seated rows, or “layers” of the network. As cards circulated quickly through each layer, users looked to identify specific characteristics of the cards and passed them to the next layer. The audience got it nearly perfect on the first try. The reason for the exercise? Many in the room will soon be using advanced-analytics technology like this to create their products, so they should understand how it works. Dan’s ambitions are lofty. “Don’t just build a good product,” he told the group, “build a disruptive one that upends the status quo!” But his approach is down to earth. “Do you have a fresh idea?” he asks. “Does it solve a need for massive number of people? Will it improve itself over time?” Once you answer “yes” to those questions, he’s got more advice: look up government statistics to size a market, map work streams across industries, and use the power of technology to amplify your problem solving—hence the neural-network exercise. The important thing, he stressed, is just to get moving. “After all,” he told the audience. “Any breakthrough is 1 percent the idea and 99 percent the execution.” High aspirations for flying cars Overlooking the clogged streets of Austin, a small group of aerospace and mobility experts—NASA’s Jaiwon Shin, Bell Helicopter Textron’s Michael Thacker, and McKinsey’s Shivika Sahdev —outlined a vision for the future of urban air mobility on a panel led by NPR’s Aarti Shahani. Think on-demand flying cars: short, quick trips on flying vehicles, quickly and quietly dropping in and out of town. “Who believes this will happen by 2025?” asked the moderator. A third of the room raised their hands. In ten years? The majority agreed it was possible. “What are the barriers?” pressed Aarti. One panelist pointed to the complexity in coordinating and managing these low-flying vehicles above crowded urban cities. To scale such travel, it will need to be affordable and quiet, said another, which will require advanced technologies for battery capacity, autonomous flight, and advanced cloud computing.
“Infrastructure,” added Shivika. “What physical spaces will be needed for these vehicles? Will they be on existing rooftops or in the outskirts?” Cities, the group explained, are grappling with access, congestion, and pollution and are open to any new solutions that help them circumvent traffic and lost productivity. For emerging cities, points out Shivika, air mobility could be a chance to leapfrog more expensive ground-based transit for a way of travel that’s cheaper and more sustainable. All agreed that such a vision will require a new ecosystem of support. “No single player can make this happen,” said Shivika. “Vehicle makers, tech companies, local and federal governments, and others will have to come together to make this a reality.” Cultivating millennials “Yeethoven” is what happens when you mash up the music of Beethoven with that of Kanye West. This Lincoln Center program attracted 900 attendees to the venue. Five hundred of them were new. All of them were under 40. John Casavant, Kathryn Peterson, and Alex Sarian, all of Lincoln Center, along with McKinsey’s Marissa Solomon , detailed how they have used analytics to identify and create more programming, like Yeethoven, to attract the millennial market to the venerable arts venue. Millennials are experimental, they’ve found, and always open to the next big thing. “They want a wider experience, starting before purchasing the ticket, including a social aspect during the event—food, happy hours, mixing it up—and following up with photos and reporting the next morning, ”  says Marissa. Getting this right has required the organization to collaborate like never before: tech, marketing, programming, and development groups are working together to capture data, develop new events, and use analytics to reach and track new audiences. One audience member wanted to know how to get started using data in a similar way. “Launch one pilot, get some results, and then launch another,” said Marissa. “Don’t wait for building the perfect infrastructure. That can take decades.” related The business value of design Never miss a story"

But if the items in question happen to be the 3M Speedglas G5-01 Heavy-Duty Welding Helmet and the BabyBjörn Small Baby Bib, they now share at least one important quality: award-winning McKinsey design. Both products have earned our firm two 2019 Red Dot Product Design awards. “This was the first time McKinsey Design won two great awards in the product design category of the Red Dot award,” says McKinsey Design global leader Hugo Sarrazin. “It’s truly a proud moment for our firm and our designers.” The Red Dot jury reviewed hundreds of products across 48 different categories that included everything from jewelry and watches to home and office furniture to commercial construction equipment and personal technology. Several designers from our Stockholm Design Studio (formerly Veryday) helped to create both of the products that Red Dot honored this year. The Speedglas helmet team, for example, included Oskar Juhlin, Jan Puranen, Hans Nyström, Emelie Hedén Edlund, and Frida Åberg. Together, the team worked hard to ensure their end user remained front-of-mind, drawing throughout their process on extensive customer data that 3M collected from welders all over the world. In particular, the helmet’s new design minimizes eye strain and helps workers breathe more easily, thanks to a feature that allows them to alter the way air is routed into the mask. “We wanted to make sure we had a clear picture of the user’s identity and needs to ensure we gave them the best possible tool to do their job well and safely,” explains Oskar Juhlin. “After all, you wouldn’t ask anyone to weld with the wrong equipment anymore than you would ask someone to change a tire with a screwdriver.” Another McKinsey Design team used a similar user-centric approach to help babies everywhere make a clean break from messy meal times. By working alongside parents and their little children alike, Elisabeth Ramel-Wåhrberg, Peter Ejvinsson, Jonas Dolk, David Crafoord, and Ulrika Vejbrink worked in collaboration with BabyBjörn to design a new waterproof, dishwasher safe, and adjustable bib. The new product minimizes messiness by catching in its scoop any food and drink that doesn’t make it to a baby’s mouth. It also lets tiny diners freely move their arms and ensures their safety; the bib quickly and easily realeases from the neck if it gets caught on anything. “Putting babies and their parents at the center of our design research has been the best way to understand their needs,” says Elisabeth Ramel-Wåhrberg. “Winning this award means a lot, and it’s proof that user-centric solutions make design come alive in the best way.” McKinsey has been strengthening its design capabilities for the past several years, bringing together industry-leading firms like Veryday (itself a 2014 Red Dot Design Team of the Year winner) and LUNAR along the way. Today, we integrate design thinking as well as product, process, and experience design into many aspects of our client work. We are currently one of the 10 largest design firms globally by size, and we recently published a first-of-its-kind study on the business value of design . The Red Dot Award for Product Design was launched in 1955 to honor the best products created every year. The 2019 award winners will be celebrated later this year at the annual Red Dot Gala in Essen, Germany. Never miss a story"
What Dutch teachers are learning from their students,How a McKinsey-founded nonprofit is helping teachers in the Netherlands become better educators by connecting them with peers and listening to the people whose lives they aim to change.,2019-04-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/what%20dutch%20teachers%20are%20learning%20from%20their%20students/leerkracht-hero-wide_1536x864.jpg,"Education,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/what-dutch-teachers-are-learning-from-their-students,"What Dutch teachers are learning from their students In six years, the McKinsey-founded education program LeerKracht has reached more than 300,000 young people in the Netherlands. April 4, 2019 For years, the Stephanus elementary school, located in a low-income neighborhood of Rotterdam, struggled to improve student performance. Then, in 2015, the school joined a McKinsey-founded nonprofit aimed at improving education through better teaching. Called LeerKracht (which means both “teacher” and “learning power” in Dutch), the initiative helps teachers learn to be better educators by collaborating with their peers and, perhaps most importantly, listening to the people whose very lives they aim to change: their students. Through the program, Stephanus teachers began to feel empowered to take ownership of their classrooms and grew more engaged in the school’s broader performance. “They started to think more deeply about education,” says principal Astrid van Gogh. Today, Stephanus is one of more than 750 schools throughout the Netherlands where improvements driven by teachers—rather than administrators—are helping to elevate the nation’s educational standards. “I believe that teachers make the difference in education,” says Jaap Versfelt , a former McKinsey senior partner who now leads LeerKracht full time. “Not the building, not money—teachers.” Lonely work, bureaucratic demands The initiative was inspired in part by a study comparing Dutch education to international benchmarks, which highlighted a worrying three-decade-long stagnation: the education system was good, but despite numerous efforts it had failed to rise to greatness. A pro bono McKinsey team explored the problem to find out why that was the case. “What stood out is that being a teacher can be a lonely job,” says Bart Woord , an engagement manager who was there at the start of the program and now works in McKinsey’s Sydney office . “You try all day to have an impact relying on your own skills and ideas with little outside input.” What stood out is that being a teacher can be a lonely job. The team realized that just as so-called continuous improvement programs can transform companies by changing employee mindsets, they can likewise change how teachers approach their tasks. “Teachers want to be given fewer answers and more challenges they can solve collaboratively,” says Paul Rutten , a partner in McKinsey’s Amsterdam office who chairs LeerKracht’s supervisory board. “They want fewer bureaucratic demands and more ways they can help students.” Sharing notes, hearing students To answer that call, LeerKracht worked with 16 schools in its first year to develop materials that would help teachers and school leaders improve teaching practices. At the heart of the program are weekly joint lesson-planning sessions where teachers offer each other feedback and share what they’re learning from their classroom experiences. They also visit each other’s classrooms to see, for example, how their colleagues are making classes engaging. Finally, the teachers meet weekly in groups to discuss their collectively set targets and to check in on each other’s progress. Jeffrey de Jong, a Grade 6 teacher at Stephanus, admits to being initially apprehensive about his colleagues observing and giving feedback on his classes. “But the process soon began to feel natural,” he says. Perhaps the most valuable component of LeerKracht is student input, which is delivered through dedicated, live sessions. In a recent one, five to six students shared their thoughts about the school as teachers sat behind them who were not allowed to comment. “Once the students left the room, the teachers became very animated, talking about what they heard,” says Woord. Principal Van Gogh calls the student discussions the school’s “greatest gem.” High marks This year LeerKracht will directly reach 10 percent of the Netherland’s student population, ranging from kindergarten through high school. McKinsey colleagues continue to be closely involved and support its work. In six years, the program has become the country’s largest ever bottom-up public sector transformation, affecting more than 300,000 young people. It's earning high marks, too. More than 95 percent of participating schools say they would recommend the program to others, and 80 percent of the teachers report that their students’ learning has improved. But the most important changes are perhaps the ones that only a teacher will see, and hear, firsthand. “Before LeerKracht, the conversation in the teachers’ room was about people’s weekend activities or what they did last night,” says de Jong. “Now we talk about substantive topics: what’s happening in the classroom.” related A London partner on a mission to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon Celebrating 10 years of impact in education Never miss a story"

Cities are already struggling with overflowing landfills and inadequate waste services. Organic waste in landfills is a major source of methane, a greenhouse gas 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Plastics wreak havoc on ocean wildlife and release toxic chemicals into the atmosphere when burned. For the past year, McKinsey.org —an independent non-profit founded by McKinsey—has been exploring the global waste challenge as it seeks to develop scalable Solutions to complex social challenges around the world. It is working in partnership with local governments, NGOs, and businesses on its first initiative, Rethinking Recycling. The initiative seeks to increase the number of households recycling and to improve the effectiveness of sorting and processing systems. It also works with businesses to encourage them to purchase recycled plastics. In its first five months, the pilot has worked with roughly 500 households, achieving a 30 percent recycling rate for dry recyclables, such as plastics, paper, and glass—higher than many US cities with decades-long histories of recycling. The program aims to expand to 10,000 households in Buenos Aires by the end of 2019. A parallel project is underway in Denpasar, the capital city of the Indonesian state of Bali. “McKinsey.org’s mission is to have lasting impact on complex social challenges,” says Cynthia Shih , a member of the McKinsey.org team. “It’s exciting to be bringing McKinsey & Company’s expertise and capabilities to directly addressing those challenges while working through innovative partnerships to create solutions that can scale up quickly.” Juan Musa , a McKinsey consultant based in our Buenos Aires office, spent six months working with McKinsey.org on the pilot. “McKinsey.org is trying to address a global problem. But it’s also a very local issue,” he explains. “The barrio is very close to our firm’s office, only 10 blocks away. Seeing this change happening is very important for me.” related A vision of beauty: How we helped Chile to create ten million acres of stunning national parklands A revolutionary tool for cutting emissions, ten years on Never miss a story"

She’ll use it to buy food, clothing, and other goods for her family at a few local businesses, all of which only accept cash. But when the worker gets there, the bank has no cash to give her. “This happens frequently throughout cash-based economies,” explains Dubai-based McKinsey business analyst Hamza Jawaid . “Only, it’s not a funding or financing problem. Fundamentally, it’s a logistical one—and we thought we could solve it.” Hamza and his fellow business analyst Ibrahim Shami got that idea while they were working with a commercial bank in Pakistan, a cash-heavy economy, and saw an opportunity to help  better manage its cash inventory. “We saw branch managers who were largely working off of gut instinct to plan for how much cash each branch and ATM needed at a time,” Hamza explains. “They had little visibility into their cash stock or how much was in transit at any point.” This, according to Hamza and Ibrahim, raises at least two undesirable situations. “When the banks have too much cash on hand, the currency doesn’t earn interest and is far more at risk of theft, which can be high in some of these markets,” Ibrahim explains. “When the banks have too little cash on hand, they’re not able to serve the communities in which they operate. This is especially crucial in rural areas, where people rely on them to withdraw their salaries.” So Hamza and Ibrahim went to Jawad Khan , a Dubai-based McKinsey partner, and spoke with him about building a forecasting tool that would enable real-time tracking of cash. “We realized banks had so much data at their fingertips,” says Hamza, “so we thought we could apply analytics to help bank managers get insights into the actual needs of each branch.” Once they had this proof of concept, Jawad worked with them to submit their idea to a McKinsey competition, which they won and then received support and investment from our in-house tech incubator, which we call Launch. “It was a clear winner from the get-go,” recalls Rahim Noormohamed , who manages a portfolio of McKinsey colleagues’ new venture ideas within the firm’s technology incubator. “Ibrahim and Hamza had tapped into a largely unmet need within emerging markets, given the heavy reliance on cash there, and it was already a big success.” The McKinsey incubator funded the team and oversaw a structured build process for their minimum viable product (MVP). It was a clear winner from the get-go. Hamza and Ibrahim called their idea ACE, short for Analytical Cash Efficiency. It was envisioned as a cloud-based cash-management tool designed to help retail banks optimize their cash operations. And now that they had won, they needed to make it a reality. The only problem? Neither of the recent college graduates had any software-development experience. So they decided to tap our firm’s network: “Looking for someone with a strong technical background for advice,” they posted on an internal message board. And they waited. Robert Muil , a seasoned data scientist in London, raised his hand. “They had already proven this could work,” says Robert on when he first started talking with Ibrahim and Hamza. “What they now needed was someone who could help produce it as a software tool.” Over the course of a year, Robert and a team of developers went into building the solution that shows managers exactly how much cash is needed at any given ATM branch—accounting for factors like seasonality or weekday—and helps determine the best strategy for shipping their cash. While Ibrahim and Hamza built their MVP, Rahim served as a trusted advisor and mentor to ACE, helping them refine their idea and showing them how to design and build the solution for client use. Over the next nine months, Hamza and Ibrahim also received coaching on pricing and delivery models and help with staffing from McKinsey experts across the firm. ACE was officially up and running by early 2018, and Ibrahim and Hamza began showing it to clients throughout the Middle East. Within a few months it was put to use with their first client, in Jordan, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in cash-management cost. “Our sights are set on scaling across Latin America and West Africa,” shares Hamza. In just the eight months since it’s launched, ACE has already been used with seven clients across three continents. Whether it’s cash, food, or something else, people shouldn’t have to think twice about getting what they need when they need it. “For that worker heading to the bank come Friday afternoon,” says Hamza, “she no longer has to worry if she’ll logistically be able to withdraw her cash.” As for what’s next, he and Ibrahim hope to expand this concept of web-based inventory optimization into other industries, like grocery stores, within emerging markets. “Whether it’s cash, food, or something else,” adds Ibrahim, “people shouldn’t have to think twice about getting what they need when they need it.” Never miss a story"

April 22, 2019 On Earth Day this year, we’re sharing stories about carbon-reduction projects we’re supporting, from restoring rainforests in Colombia to providing solar stoves in rural China. Alongside our efforts to reduce our emissions, these projects help us fulfill our commitment to running our firm in a way that is environmentally sustainable . They also have positive impacts for the environment and communities where they take place. One such project supports communities around Zimbabwe’s Lake Kariba. Frequent droughts and lack of productive land have forced residents to clear ever larger swaths of the surrounding woodlands to farm. Over time, practices such as this have reduced Zimbabwe’s forests by more than a third. Explore our global carbon offset projects The Kariba Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) project is helping households adopt conservation-farming practices such as mulching, composting, and crop rotation, which allow them to maintain the same plots year after year where they grow maize, sorghum, and vegetables. “Even when the rains were poor one year, my crops managed to yield a surplus,” says Julia Choocha, who lives on the south shore of Lake Kariba. “I sold some of that harvest and could buy clothes for my children.” The project is helping to preserve 785,000 hectares of biodiverse forest, home to numerous vulnerable species such as elephants and black rhinos. Since 2011, this has prevented more than 18 million tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere. It is one of eight carbon reductions projects supported by McKinsey together with our partner South Pole . The projects are independently verified to ensure they are effective and environmentally sound. They primarily focus on forestry and land use, the issue selected by our firm members in an internal poll. “Our firm’s activities lead to the emission of around 780,000 tons of greenhouse gases, annually, much of which comes from air travel to our clients’ sites. But we’re committed to being carbon neutral,” explains Jop Weterings , our firm’s head of environmental sustainability. “There are two ways we can address our carbon footprint: reducing emissions and offsetting the emissions through contributions to carbon-reduction projects,” he says, “We need to do both.” Our emissions reduction initiatives include transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity for all offices by 2025, improving energy efficiency in our offices, and switching from air to rail travel when possible.

A McKinsey leader unites women in tech to prepare for the future of work,"Over 2 days,100-plus women from across tech and operations came together to share stories of their experiences and hear from other women leaders who are working to combat ""onliness"" in their  organizations amid Industry 4.0.",2019-04-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20mckinsey%20is%20helping%20women%20prepare%20for%20the%20future%20of%20work/wit_hero_dcc1_1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Digital,Operations",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-mckinsey-leader-unites-women-in-tech-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work,"A McKinsey leader unites women in tech to prepare for the future of work Attendees getting a glimpse into digital manufacturing at our Digital Capability Center in Chicago April 29, 2019 “As we think about the nature of work changing now and in the future, it’s really important we make sure women stay competitive,” says Gayatri Shenai , a McKinsey partner. “This is especially critical in areas like tech and operations that are still some of the most underrepresented fields when it comes to diversity.” That mandate is also rather personal for Gayatri. Like thousands of women working in the male-dominated tech and manufacturing industries, she has often found herself an “ only ”—or the only person like her at work—in a range of settings from the factory floor to the C-suite. It’s a situation that can be stressful, isolating, and completely disheartening. But a few years ago, Gayatri decided to do something to help others like her feel less alone. She took it upon herself to organize an annual conference for women executives in tech and operations. This year’s edition took place earlier this month in Chicago. Over 2 days, more than 100 women from across the tech and operations industries came together to share stories of their experiences and hear from other women leaders who are working to combat onliness in their respective organizations as they prepare for the future of work. McKinsey’s global managing partner, Kevin Sneader, delivered opening remarks before turning over the stage to our distinguished guests. My hope is that no one here leaves this place feeling like an only. One of them was former US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker , who talked about her belief in the need for more apprenticeships in the United States. Only about 30 percent of Americans graduate from college, she explained, which she believes makes a clear argument that the road to professional success for most is not paved in a 4-year degree. “No one in this room is here accidentally,” said Penny. “But there are too many people in this country for whom skill-building opportunities just don’t exist.” Rain Hayes, who is the senior director of quality engineering at Slack, echoed this sentiment. She shared that she had never attended college and is a completely self-taught engineer. And neither is a college degree a barrier to entry on her teams, one of which boasts 3 formerly incarcerated developers who learned how to code while in prison. “How can we scale this kind of pairing and mentorship in the workforce?” Rain asked. Betsy Ziegler had some insight. She committed herself to mentorship in her role as CEO of 1871, a hub for Chicago’s digital start-up community that provides entrepreneurs with space, connections, education, training, and early-stage venture capital. She urged the audience to be open to change and to continuously encourage new ideas and working models from teammates. “If the pace of innovation inside your organization is slower than the pace of innovation outside your organization, you’re on a downward slope,” she said. Increased velocity is a hallmark of the modern workplace, of course, and according to Nationwide CIO Susan Gueli , “the pace of change is only getting faster; never again will it be as slow as it is today.” She made this real by explaining that the half-life of a learned skill in technology is just 3 to 5 years, which requires teams to regularly reinvent themselves and be resilient. That point was emphasized by an audience member who recounted how after her company went through an agile transformation that included thorough training, she reapplied for her existing role as head of technology enablement to ensure her skills had evolved as needed. “I found it fascinating to go through that kind of process,” she said. “It made me feel that much more confident in my abilities to do my job.” Such resilience is one of the many ways Johnson Controls CIO Nancy Berce has dealt with being an “only.” “While it can often feel lonely,” she said, “it’s taught me to learn how to survive.” In a personal story, Nancy talked about how she discovered this in her childhood. Raised by a single father in a house with two brothers, she grew up swimming competitively against boys. ...you don’t have to adopt all these fancy tools, do it all, or do it a right way. At Johnson Controls, where just 17 percent of employees are women, Nancy has reached her goal for the past six months of having 50-50 representation in her group. “If you don’t like the environment you’re in, try working to change it,” she said. “Even as onlies, we should feel we have the power to do that.” Some, of course, can’t change their environments without significant investment. In Chicago, our attendees had a chance to see the way we help clients learn by stepping outside of theirs for a moment. To see what’s going on at the world’s most cutting-edge factories, the group toured our Digital Capability Center , a working model of a tech-enabled facility. They saw firsthand how augmented reality and other innovations are revolutionizing their industries. “One of our goals here has been to show people that you don’t have to adopt all these fancy tools, do it all, or do it a right way,” says Katy George , a McKinsey senior partner. “We want people to realize that the barriers to entry for digitization are lower than you might think and the future of work for women is quite hopeful.” Johanne Lavoie , a McKinsey partner, shared research that shows traits most often  exhibited by women, like creativity, emotional intelligence, and collaboration have that much more weight as dull and repetitive tasks become more automated. “I never thought this event would turn into what it is today,” Gayatri says. “We had a simple idea—to bring women in this field together—and now it’s become this amazing event that keeps growing and growing. My hope is that no one here leaves this place feeling like an only.” related Four McKinsey leaders share their advice for early-career women Never miss a story"
How do CEOs manage their time? The winners of the 60th annual HBR McKinsey Award explain,Two HBR experts spent more than a decade studying how CEOs manage their single most important resource: time. Here’s what they discovered.,2019-05-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20do%20ceos%20manage%20their%20time/hbr-awards-hero-columnwide_1536x864.jpg,Awards,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-do-ceos-manage-their-time-the-winners-of-the-60th-annual-hbr-mckinsey-award-explain,"How do CEOs manage their time? The winners of the 60th annual HBR McKinsey Award explain May 23, 2019 Nitin Nohria , a dean at Harvard Business School, and Michael E. Porter , a professor at Harvard Business School, have spent their careers forging future CEOs in the classroom and writing for them in influential management publications. But about ten years ago, Porter says, they realized that “we had little understanding of what CEOs actually do.” They decided to find out, devoting more than a decade to collecting data from CEOs about how they spend their most valuable resource: time. The resulting article, “ How CEOs Manage Time ,” has won the 2018 HBR McKinsey Award for best Harvard Business Review article of the year. The award was presented on Thursday, May 16, at a dinner at Harvard Business School. Nohria and Porter collected 60,000 hours’ worth of data from 27 CEOs, interviewing each for more insight into how they think they use their time. The data set they created illustrates the ways CEOs navigate the inevitable trade-offs of this finite resource, no matter how well they manage their time. The findings have also been discussed with hundreds of other CEOs participating in Harvard Business School’s yearly workshop for newly appointed leaders. “Time management is a crucial issue in today’s high-pressure and fast-changing environment,” said Adi Ignatius, editor in chief of Harvard Business Review . “‘How CEOs Manage Their Time’ offers a fascinating window into the demands and complexities of leading a company, and its insightful analysis can help all leaders who want to use their time and influence more effectively.” So how do you figure out what CEOs actually do with their time? “Mapping what they do was the first step,” says Porter. He and Nohria created a taxonomy of time—categories that could usefully describe the many different activities they undertake, like meetings with direct reports, spending time with investors, and answering emails, as well as exercise, time with families, and alone time. The second step was enlisting willing CEOs and their executive assistants. “You want me to track every 15-minute increment of my day, 24/7, for 15 months?” Porter remembers CEOs reacting to their request. “This wasn’t for the faint-hearted. Their assistants were ready to kill us all,” Nohria says. Over the course of more than a decade, Nohria and Porter gathered data. “It’s one of the joys of tenure, to be able to spend as long as we did on this research,” says Nohria. In addition to collecting the time logs, the pair interviewed the CEOs—a step that frequently yielded more insight than the logs themselves. They found that the CEO job is “all consuming.” For instance, according to the article, chief executives conduct business on 79% of weekend days and on 70% of vacation days. “As these figures show,” they write, “the CEO’s job is relentless.” Nohria and Porter also found that chief executives are “always in meetings,” “agenda driven,” and “rely heavily on direct reports.” What surprised them most was the gap between the CEOs’ expectations of how they spent their time versus how they actually did spend their time. “No, we’re not making this up,” Nohria recalls saying on many occasions. “The single most common surprise: CEOs thought they spent lots of time with customers. In fact, few of them really did.” The pair plans to follow up with their study subjects after five or six years to see if their participation in the research has changed how they spend their time. Can everyone apply this technique for insight into their own habits? “Some things in this research are pretty specific to CEOs. However, in general, one of the takeaways is, do you have a personal agenda? How are you spending alone time? There are many lessons that are applicable,” says Nohria. Porter agrees: “This research applies to anyone with a significant managerial role. If every manager knew the taxonomy of time categories, that alone would be useful.” This year’s HBR McKinsey Award also recognized two other finalists: “ The Surprising Power of Questions ,” which provides guidance on how to hone a valuable skill, by Alison Wood Brooks and Leslie K. John of Harvard Business School; and “ Strategy for Start-ups ” by Joshua Gans of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management and Erin L. Scott and Scott Stern of the MIT Sloan School of Management. The 2018 HBR McKinsey Award judges were Bharat Anand, professor, Harvard Business School; Cheryl Bachelder, interim CEO, Pier 1 Imports; Peter Cappelli, professor, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania; and Claudio Fernández-Aráoz, senior advisor, Egon Zehnder. Since 1959, the HBR McKinsey Awards have recognized 142 articles published in Harvard Business Review . Past winners include Clayton M.

McKinsey alums have turned them into unicorns May 29, 2019 McKinsey alumni are enthusiastic entrepreneurs: about 20 percent go on to found their own companies after leaving the firm. Alums have founded or cofounded a number of familiar companies, including Ashoka, Innocent Drinks, Match.com, and Viking River Cruises. What you may not know is that a number of start-ups founded by alumni in the past decade have become unicorns, or privately held start-ups—usually tech based—valued at $1 billion or more. To put that in a broader context, McKinsey alumni have, as of this writing, founded about 3.5 percent of the world’s current unicorns. Read on to find out about some of these companies and their founders. [Note: Although three of the companies listed below have graduated from unicorn status—one through acquisition, two through IPOs—these took place so recently that we have included them to acknowledge their achievements.] Careem Cofounders: Mudassir Sheikha (2008–12) and Magnus Olsson (2006–12) Headquarters: Dubai Value: Sold to Uber for $3.1 billion Careem, a car-booking service, operates in 14 Middle Eastern countries. At the end of March, Uber announced that it would acquire the company. Careem will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary, still led by its founders. Read our 2018 interview with Mudassir Sheikha and watch our 2019 interview with Magnus Olsson.) CommonBond Cofounder: David Klein (2003–06) Headquarters: New York City Value: Undisclosed but reported at $4 billion Student loans are a big issue in the United States: students (and former students) owe $1.5 trillion. David Klein cofounded online lender CommonBond in 2012 to offer loan refinancing, as well as private student loans with low rates and great customer service. Compass Cofounder: Robert Reffkin (2000–02) Headquarters: New York City Value: $4.4 billion Robert Reffkin cofounded real-estate technology company Compass just five years ago, but it already operates in 20 major US cities—and he’s eyeing international expansion. In 2018 alone, Compass opened 70 new offices and hired more than 600 people. (Read our January interview with Robert.) DoorDash Cofounder: Tony Xu (2007–09) Headquarters: San Francisco Value: $7.1 billion Don’t feel like cooking? DoorDash can help. Founded in 2013, the app pairs drivers and local restaurants to deliver meals to users wherever they are. (Cofounder Tony Xu started out doing deliveries himself.) The company is now the leading US on-demand food-delivery service in consumer-spending market share. Go-Jek Cofounder: Nadiem Makarim (2006–11) Headquarters: Jakarta Value: $10 billion Go-Jek, Indonesia’s first decacorn (a start-up with a valuation of $10 billion or more), began life in 2010 as a motorbike taxi company. It has since grown exponentially in size—it boasts a fleet with two million drivers—and in scope. Go-Jek is now a “super-app,” offering two dozen user services, such as online payments, restaurant orders, and grocery deliveries. Users can even use the app to order a massage. Grab Cofounder: Hooi Ling Tan (2006–13) Headquarters: Singapore Value: Undisclosed but reported at $14 billion Based in Singapore and operating in eight Southeast Asian countries, Grab was initially just a ride-hailing app. Over the past seven years, it has added services such as food deliveries, payments, and assistance planning travel routes on public transportation; it even offers specially trained drivers to take pets to the vet. Like Go-Jek, Grab has evolved from a unicorn into a decacorn—the region’s first, reaching that status in November 2018. InMobi Founder: Naveen Tewari (2000–03 and 2005–05) Headquarters: Bangalore Value: $2 billion InMobi, a global mobile-advertising platform, was the first Indian start-up valued at $1 billion, according to VCCircle. In 2018, Fast Company ranked InMobi as number three in its Top Ten Most Innovative Companies list for India. Jumia Cofounders: Jeremy Hodara (2006–12) and Sacha Poignonnec (2007–12) Headquarters: Ikeja, Nigeria Value: Undisclosed but reported at $1 billion Founded in 2012, Internet platform Jumia became Africa’s first unicorn just four years later. It’s the continent’s largest e-commerce business, with operations in 14 countries. Jumia operates a network of services that include food deliveries, secure payments, travel booking, and classified ads. The company launched an IPO on the NYSE in April. Lazada Co-founder: Max Bittner (2007-12) Headquarters: Singapore Exited: Acquired by Alibaba in 2018 Lazada is an online marketplace offering e-commerce and e-payments throughout Southeast Asia. With operations in six countries and fulfillment centers in 17 Southeast Asian cities, Lazada is Southeast Asia's largest e-commerce platform. The company sold to Alibaba for $3B in 2018, becoming Alibaba's Southeast Asian flagship. Nauto Co-founders: Stefan Heck (1996-13), Nauto's current CEO, and Frederick Soo (2011-14), current Head of Product Development at Mythic, Inc. Headquarters: Palo Alto Value: $1B Nauto, founded in 2015, is an AI technology company that develops software to improve the safety of self-driving cars. Major automakers are taking note: Nauto has received investments from GM, BMW, and Toyota. Oscar Health Cofounder: Mario Schlosser (2002–07) Headquarters: New York City Value: $3.2 billion Mario Schlosser launched Oscar Health, a tech-based, consumer-focused health insurer, in 2012 with classmates from Harvard Business School. Oscar currently offers individual and group plans in six US states. Mario says his goal is to “humanize and simplify the healthcare experience.” Zilingo Founder: Ankiti Bose (2010–12) Headquarters: Singapore Value: Undisclosed but reported at $1 billion The Singapore-based e-commerce platform doesn’t discuss its valuation, but a TechCrunch article quoted a source as saying that Zilingo is “a rounding error away” from $1 billion. The site gives visibility to small Southeast Asian fashion vendors lacking their own online presence. In addition to retailing, Zilingo has recently focused on B2B opportunities in the supply chain—which helped the company to realize fourfold growth in the past year. Zocdoc Cofounders: Oliver Kharraz-Tavakol (2001–07), Zocdoc’s current CEO, and Cyrus Massoumi (2004–07), founder and now managing partner of Humbition Headquarters: New York City Value: $2 billion Zocdoc, the leading digital healthcare marketplace in the United States, helps millions of patients each month to find nearby in-network doctors, see their availability in real time, and instantly book appointments online.

"Meet Kedro, McKinsey’s first open-source software tool","In a first for McKinsey, our analytics firm, QuantumBlack recently released an open source tool called Kedro. Created for data scientists and engineers, it streamlines the development of machine-learning projects.",2019-06-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/meet%20kedro%20mckinseys%20first%20open-source%20software%20tool/kedro_leadspace-small_1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-kedro-mckinseys-first-open-source-software-tool,"Meet Kedro, McKinsey’s first open-source software tool A key benefit of Kedro is its ability to visualize complex machine-learning projects. June 6, 2019 QuantumBlack , the advanced analytics firm we acquired in 2015, has now launched Kedro, an open source tool created specifically for data scientists and engineers. It is a library of code that can be used to create data and machine-learning pipelines . For our non-developer readers, these are the building blocks of an analytics or machine-learning project. “Kedro can change the way data scientists and engineers work,” explains product manager Yetunde Dada , “making it easier to manage large workflows and ensuring a consistent quality of code throughout a project.” Introducing Kedro McKinsey has never before created a publicly available, open source tool. “It represents a significant shift for the firm,” notes Jeremy Palmer , CEO of QuantumBlack, “as we continue to balance the value of our proprietary assets with opportunities to engage as part of the developer community, and accelerate as well as share our learning.” The name Kedro, which derives from the Greek word meaning center or core, signifies that this open-source software provides crucial code for ‘productionizing’ advanced analytics projects. Kedro has two major benefits: it allows teams to collaborate more easily by structuring analytics code in a uniform way so that it flows seamlessly through all stages of a project. This can include consolidating data sources, cleaning data, creating features and feeding the data into machine-learning models for explanatory or predictive analytics. Kedro also helps deliver code that is ‘production-ready,’ making it easier to integrate into a business process. “Data scientists are trained in mathematics, statistics and modeling—not necessarily in the software engineering principles required to write production code,” explains Yetunde. “Often, converting a pilot project into production code can add weeks to a timeline, a pain point with clients. Now, they can spend less time on the code, and more time focused on applying analytics to solving their clients’ problems.” At a feature level, Kedro helps teams build data pipelines that are modular, tested, reproducible in any environment and versioned, allowing users to access previous data states. “More importantly, the same code can make the transition from a single developer’s laptop to an enterprise-level project using cloud computing,” explains Ivan Danov , Kedro’s technical lead. “And it is agnostic, working across industries, models and data sources.” Two years in the making, Kedro was the brainchild of two QuantumBlack engineers – Nikolaos Tsaousis and Aris Valtazanos , and QuantumBlack alumnus, Peteris Erins ,
who created it to manage their numerous workstreams. Kedro had started as a prototype library and was being quickly adapted by different teams when they brought it to Quantum Black Labs , a technical innovation group led by Michele Battelli . “Client teams can rotate into our lab and have the resources to convert a one-off piece of software or database [such as Kedro] into a viable product that can be used across industries, and that will be continually improved,” explains Michele. “It is a powerful way of innovating; our tech teams can move faster, more efficiently, and make a lasting contribution.” McKinsey has used Kedro on more than 50 projects, to date. According to Nikolaos, clients especially like its pipeline visualization. He explains that Kedro makes conversations much easier, as clients immediately see the different transformation stages, types of models involved, and can backtrack outputs all the way to the raw data source. “Kedro began as a proprietary program, but when a project was over, clients couldn’t access the tool any more. We had created a technical debt,” Nikolaos said. “By converting Kedro into an open source tool, clients can use it after we leave a project—it is one way we are giving back."" “There is a lot of work ahead, but our hope and vision is that Kedro should help advance the standard for how data and modelling pipelines are built around the world, while enabling continuous and accelerated learning. There are huge opportunities for organizations to improve their performance and decision-making based on data, but capturing these opportunities at scale, and safely, is extremely complex and requires intense collaboration,” says Jeremy. “We’re keenly interested to see what the community does with this and how we can work and learn faster together.” Learn more about Kedro at GitHub, where you can engage with our team and watch for new features in coming months. related McKinsey donates open-source tool Kedro to the Linux Foundation Accelerating with QuantumBlack QuantumBlack opens in Montreal, a leading center of AI Never miss a story"

Today, she works to combat such intolerance, especially in the workplace. A senior partner in McKinsey’s Abu Dhabi office, Rima has emerged as a trusted advisor to Middle East governments on public finance and as a steadfast champion for gender parity. Earlier this year, she gained a new way to shape the region’s future and push boundaries when she was elected to the Forum of Young Global Leaders (YGL) , the World Economic Forum’s organization of professionals under the age of 40 working to improve the state of the world. Founded more than 15 years ago, YGL now includes more than 1,300 alumni composed of public officials, business innovators, artists, educators, technology developers, journalists, and activists of more than 100 nationalities. Since joining McKinsey, Rima has focused on improving the everyday experiences and opportunities of residents in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. That means working with finance ministries on reallocating resources and funding for programs and processes, like loan approvals, that will help change the lives of citizens for the better. “I’m looking forward to using the YGL platform to continue making this region a great place for all kinds of people to live,” she says. Of particular importance to Rima are women empowerment and finding ways to attract and retain women in the workforce, critical issues in GCC countries, where the workforce is predominately male. “Women matter in companies and in society,” she once argued in Newsweek Middle East . “They constitute half the world’s working-age population but generate only 37 percent of GDP and undertake 75 percent of unpaid work. Enabling women to be equal partners in society and the workforce will not only be equitable in the broadest sense but unambiguously good for business.” We’re taught from such a young age not to be as forceful or perseverant as men, which is counter to what the work environment often asks of us. Rima can attest to those statistics. Given the large expatriate community in the GCC, she says she has seen many high-performing and accomplished women leave the workforce because they don’t have the support systems, like local family and close friends, necessary to maintain their careers. “What’s needed are more role models and sponsors for women here who can help change corporate cultures and mind-sets,” she says. It’s a call Rima has been answering herself for nearly a decade. About 8 years ago, she started to think more carefully about finding ways to drive the corporate advancement of women in the region. Since then, she’s spearheaded trainings and networking events where she brings together experts on various topics, like grit and perseverance, to help inspire and encourage women. She also has contributed to research in our Women Matter report on boosting employment and equal pay for women, and has helped actively recruit men and women from different countries, nationalities, and beliefs to foster a greater sense of diversity and inclusion within our Middle East offices. “There are so many biases that are perpetuated and instilled in women, starting from childhood,” she says. “We’re taught from such a young age not to be as forceful or perseverant as men, which is counter to what the work environment often asks of us.” By giving talks , hosting conferences like the Global Women’s Forum Dubai , and publishing articles on gender parity, Rima is committed to getting that message out. Over the next five years, those efforts will be boosted in a new way, thanks to the YGL. “We’re already seeing meaningful progress here in policies on maternity leave, severance, and equal pay,” she says. “We’ve still got a way to go, but this new platform will hopefully quicken the pace of our progress.” related Davos 2019: Four big themes A passion for diversity starts early, at home Never miss a story"

By the end of 2018, Generation had trained 25,000 young people worldwide, placing 81 percent in jobs across 25 different fields Inspired by our research on the education-to-employment gap, McKinsey founded Generation —an independent non-profit tackling youth employment. In less than 3 years, the program in Kenya has grown to be Generation’s largest, with 12,000 graduates placed in jobs in banking, financial sales, sewing-machine operation, restaurant services, retail, and distribution. Generation’s program in Spain , one of the non-profit’s earliest, is filling 7 percent of all digital-marketing vacancies in the country, with a strong emphasis on preparing women for tech jobs. 3. We’re making the economic and business case for diversity—in 2018, our Women in the Workplace researchers surveyed more than 64,000 employees They interviewed women of different races and ethnicities along with LGBTQ+ women about their workplace experiences. They also identified trends and best practices to help companies turn good intentions into lasting change. We’re committed to increasing diversity and fostering inclusion in our own firm. Last year, we extended our diversity reach to include supporting the indigenous peoples of Australia through skills building and economic-development programs. 4. We’re helping to build an environmentally sustainable planet—in 2018 we helped Chile create ten million acres of new national parkland For more than 10 years, the research of McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice has framed environmental challenges and opportunities for businesses and governments. In 2018, we provided pro bono support to Tompkins Conservation to help make the economic case for Chile’s new national parks, which will benefit local communities as well as the environment. We also founded the non-profit McKinsey.org , which is developing new approaches for community-led recycling systems to create socially and environmentally responsible solutions to the waste crisis the world faces. 5. As a firm, we have zero net carbon emissions Since 2018, we have been carbon neutral . We have achieved this by reducing our emissions where possible—87 percent of the electricity we use in our offices is from renewable sources and we have committed to 100 percent by 2025—and are offsetting the remainder by investing in high-quality carbon-reduction projects. After a firmwide poll, we decided to focus our offset efforts on forestry and land-use projects.

Eight messages for future LGBTQ+ leaders,"As we celebrate Pride week and the progress that's been made, we spoke to leaders across McKinsey and outside our firm to hear what advice they’d give to future LGBTQ+ leaders.",2019-06-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/eight%20messages%20for%20future%20lgbtq%20leaders/pride-hero-col-wide_1062x596.jpg,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/eight-messages-for-future-lgbtq-leaders,"Eight messages for future LGBTQ+ leaders Founded in 1995, McKinsey’s network for LGBTQ+ colleagues, Equal at McKinsey, has evolved and grown across our firm globally to include people of all orientations. June 21, 2019 During the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn in New York City, one of the only establishments in the city at the time that openly welcomed gay people. Protests immediately ensued, and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights began. On the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, we celebrate the progress that’s been made, and we’re hopeful for the future and what remains to be done, especially when it comes to building diverse, inclusive spaces in the workplace. In that spirit, we spoke to leaders across McKinsey and attendees from our annual conference The Alliance to hear what advice they’d give to future LGBTQ+ leaders. Here’s what they had to say. 1. Find a job that embraces your authenticity Keisha Bell , managing director at The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) You spend a lot of time at work and with colleagues, so it’s in your best interest to do your due diligence on a company before you get there. You want to have a good sense of the organizational values to ensure they line up with your own. When searching for a job, talk with past and current employees and read online reviews. If things become difficult, and your corporate environment doesn’t feel right, find something else. You don’t have to navigate your career according to some map that someone else has written. Let your passion be your compass. 2. You are not alone; allies are everywhere Kevin Sneader , McKinsey global managing partner I recall arriving at a firm three decades ago that felt very alien. I lacked the same university experiences, educational qualifications, and heritage as my fellow business analysts. But what I had not bargained for was the support I found and the willingness that those around displayed to help me gain confidence and be myself. As I found my feet, I have always drawn on the belief that being yourself is essential to being able to be happy and high-performing at the same time. I strongly believe that this sense is shared by many. And I for one am committed to being the best ally possible. 3. Be out from the start Patrick McLaughlin , senior vice president  and  chief human-resources officer at Frito-Lay North America Don’t be afraid to be honest about who you are. That’s something you should establish from the beginning in your work environment, even in an interview. People take you at your own self-worth. If you present confidence and comfort in who you are, you’ll be a better leader, better at your job, and free from the anxiety that comes from concealing your identity. Pride in who you are has a significant impact on work culture, especially for more junior colleagues. When organizations have senior leaders who are out, it sends an important message that it’s possible to be LGBTQ+ at the top. Only by seeing this can people imagine it for themselves. 4. Find or build a community Diana Ellsworth , McKinsey partner Whether it’s inside or outside your company, there’s tremendous value in creating a network of friends who have shared experiences and allies who understand those experiences. It’s not only an excellent way to connect with other LGBTQ+ colleagues who can play an important role in supporting and energizing you but also a powerful means for generating awareness for colleagues, recruits, and the general public. Equal at McKinsey is our firm’s network for that. It connects more than 600 McKinsey LGBTQ+ colleagues from across the world, and its mission mirrors McKinsey’s: to attract, develop, and retain exceptional people, as well as have distinctive, lasting impact on the world. Equal at McKinsey carries that out by fostering a culture of inclusivity through mentorship, leadership development, and innovative external engagement like The Alliance, and it has been an important part of my professional life for the past ten years. 5. Be a force for change Masa Yanagisawa , co-head of APAC Capital at Deutsche Bank Make your voice heard. If something doesn’t feel right, then it’s not. Find a trusted superior who can guide you on how best to handle an uncomfortable situation. I remember when I first joined the trading floor of a Wall Street bank 20 years ago, there were things happening in the office that made me uncomfortable. I didn’t know what to make of it and felt so out of place. Today, it would never happen—and that’s progress. When you speak out and increasingly make people aware of differences that exist, diversity can be established quicker than you might think. 6. Create a home for yourself Guangyu Li , McKinsey senior partner Once you’re working in an LGBTQ+-friendly environment, make it your home. Find your friends, get organized, and nurture this place to be a safe haven that fully embraces diversity and inclusion for you, for your colleagues, and for the many future generations to come. 7. Show tolerance Ali Potia , McKinsey partner You will encounter a lack of understanding far more often than overt homophobia. Remember that your colleagues, bosses, sponsors or even customers have not had as much time with this subject as you have. You’ve been figuring this out your whole life. Give them the space they need to catch up. Include them in conversations and be patient when answering their questions. They’re learning. 8. Don’t make assumptions Ana Mendy , McKinsey partner We all have unconscious bias, and sometimes that prevents us from reaching out and being true to who we are. It’s easy to assume that someone from a certain region or background may be less open, delaying or preventing us from coming out from the start. I’ve found that some of the strongest allies I’ve encountered are actually people I’d originally discounted or dismissed because of my own biases. Being willing and able to reach out to colleagues of all backgrounds creates a more inclusive environment for everyone. Never miss a story"
Product development gets a makeover—with virtual reality,"By using virtual reality, our product-development team can bypass the constraints of the physical world—and dramatically shrink the time it takes to create and refine products.",2019-06-28T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/product%20development%20gets%20a%20makeover%20with%20virtual%20reality/hero-immersive-ideation-hero-col-wide-3_1536x864.jpg,"Innovation,Operations",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/product-development-gets-a-makeover-with-virtual-reality,"Product development gets a makeover—with virtual reality Virtual reality brings powerful new capabilities to product development. June 28, 2019 Here at McKinsey, we’re perhaps best known for the strategic counsel we provide business leaders around the world. But we do much more than that. We join clients in the C-suite, on the frontlines, and everywhere in between to transform how they work, build enduring capabilities, and embed technology into everything they do. One way we do that today is about to get a makeover—with virtual reality (VR). “Our product development and design-to-value (DTV) capabilities are getting a big step up thanks to VR,” explains Tobias Geisbüsch , a senior expert and industrial engineer who works in product development. In the past, Tobias explains, the way we helped clients build new products and unlock value in existing ones has been extremely effective, but it wasn’t without certain limitations. “We have DTV labs in ten locations all over the world,” he says. “We would fly everyone to one location—in Singapore or Poland, for example—and create complex models and booklets on the ground. But there might be certain products you couldn’t get in that location, and the situation overall limited the amount of time we had for input and iterations. We knew there had to be a better way.” So two years ago, the product-development team within our Operations Practice in Europe started to experiment with VR, the computer-generated immersive environments often used in gaming. At the time, the technology was advancing quickly. VR goggles had become more affordable, and digitization and increased processing power were making it easier to import visuals from graphic design studios, drones, and satellite photography. “Virtual reality breaks the constraints of our physical world,” explains Mateusz Marek , an expert who is a physicist by training and leads cost-engineering work at McKinsey. “It can be used anywhere, anytime, with one person or tens of people. You can see structures you couldn’t access before, either because they are too big or in places we couldn’t get to.” According to Mateusz, these include places like airfields, mines, industrial sites, weather stations. VR demos can be experienced in group settings with a moderator and screen or remotely, by dialing in and joining others in a virtual “room.” According to those who have tried it, the experience takes some getting used to. “It feels strange at first,” says Jean-Victor Panzani , an associate partner who has used the technology with a number of clients. “You have to realize your body is in a different place from what you are seeing, but you quickly get used to it, and it feels like reality.” A virtual-reality demo can help our designers, engineers, and developers solve problems in new ways. It lets them step into a world where they can see and interact with a product, access a variety of data with a mouse click, and make assessments across a range of variables. The team calls it “immersive ideation.” In one recent example, a team used VR to redesign an electric-vehicle charging station. Participants could create, test, and improve new features that were not even at a prototype stage yet. How did it look? Did it have the right functionalities? Was it easy for a driver to access the station? And they could interact with the charging station virtually, in ways that would be impossible in reality: making cross-sections, tearing components apart. They could point to different components, and a list of materials, shapes, and colors would pop up. They could test variations, compare access with internal components for maintenance, and even simulate the recharging sequence of an electric vehicle. It was an immediate ‘aha’ moment—and they agreed on the spot to make the investment. Slides alone couldn’t have done it. That’s because our VR platform incorporates a portfolio of McKinsey assets and expertise developed from our work around the world. “A person can see analytical data per component—cost, variations, energy efficiencies,” explains Tobias. “Our X-ray data covers a company’s history with that particular component: How many did [the company] buy over five years, what percentage of the overall product budget is it? Social-media analytics offer consumer insights such as color and feature preferences. And it includes product-design guidance from our Design Practice .” VR can also help developers and engineers work faster, through instantaneous iterations and seamless collaboration no matter where people happen to be located. In some cases, design development can be reduced by half. “More companies can also benefit from using the DTV methodology, which previously had challenges related to the size or availability of products,” points out Wolfgang Guenthner , a McKinsey partner and mechanical engineer. The team has used VR to design and refine a range of products, from cereal boxes to heavy industrial equipment to hotel lobbies. Sometimes, VR can also be used to change mind-sets. Jean-Victor recalls working on a team helping a major food-processing company with an enterprise-wide procurement transformation. They had a number of plants around the globe that were run by electrical controllers, each with a unique design that was complex to make, expensive to buy, and difficult to maintain. If they could standardize these control panels, it would be a major way forward to improving overall competitiveness. “None of the senior steering executives had seen the actual electrical boards or knew how they worked. There was reluctance to fund a major redesign of those ‘big black boxes’,” remembers Jean-Victor. “We decided to use a VR demo at the meeting. As the different control panels appeared side by side in VR, it was an immediate ‘aha’ moment—and they agreed on the spot to make the investment. Slides alone couldn’t have done it.” related Want to improve a product? Meet our teardown experts At these factories, robots are making jobs better for workers Never miss a story"
QuantumBlack continues expansion with two new offices in Asia,"McKinsey announces two new QuantumBlack offices in Asia, bringing our analytics firm's total to nine worldwide.",2019-07-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/quantumblack%20continues%20expansion%20with%20two%20new%20offices%20in%20asia/qb-asia-hero-col-wide-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Asia",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/quantumblack-continues-expansion-with-two-new-offices-in-asia,"QuantumBlack continues expansion with two new offices in Asia McKinsey announced two new QuantumBlack locations in Singapore and Tokyo at Decoded 2019, a client event last week. From left, Diaan-Yi Lin, managing partner, Singapore, McKinsey & Company; Kelvin Wong, assistant managing director, Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB); Jeremy Palmer, CEO, QuantumBlack; Chan Chun Sing, minister for trade and industry, Singapore; Dawn Lim, director, professional services, EDB; Kaushik Das, managing partner, Southeast Asia, McKinsey & Company; and Wojtek Krok, partner, McKinsey & Company. July 8, 2019 QuantumBlack , our advanced analytics firm, is expert at turning minute variations in performance into a competitive edge. But when it comes to reach, we are thinking big. Since we acquired the firm over three  years ago, our partnership has allowed us to grow QuantumBlack from its original base in London to nine offices around the world, including two new locations in Asia: Tokyo and Singapore . Almost 40 percent of our work today involves some form of digital transformation including analytics, and our QuantumBlack expansion reflects our commitment to bringing our expertise to clients across the globe. Jeremy Palmer , CEO of QuantumBlack, announced the new Asia offices at a client event last week. “Singapore is the hub of Southeast Asia. It has a vibrant mix of international companies and great local names, and a strong commitment to progress and technology,” he said. “And Japan has the third largest economy in the world, a prized engineering history, and a mind-set of continuous improvement, with its Six Sigma and other methodologies. It’s an ideal fit with the way we work—using analytics to continually improve our clients’ performance.” The Singapore office will be led by Wojtek Krok , a McKinsey partner. He built McKinsey’s Analytics Practice in his home country of Poland in 2015 and has now returned to Singapore, where he earned his MBA. “This is exactly the right time to scale analytics for Singaporean and Southeast Asian clients in high growth markets such as Indonesia and Thailand,” Wojtek explains. “A number of them have done an initial pilot or two and are ready to move quickly beyond that point.” According to Wojtek, the QuantumBlack protocol allows companies to create both a technical and organizational foundation for applying analytics. “We activate the data sources, get the technology in place, and build the skills teams need to create a replicable process to implement again and again,” he says. Unlike in other regions, Wojtek adds, many Southeast Asian companies view their data as an opportunity to launch whole new businesses. “For example, a telecom provider might try using its data to start a new consumer-rating arm,” he says. “Companies here are eager to look beyond applying analytics to improve performance.” In Singapore, the QuantumBlack team of data scientists, engineers, machine-learning specialists, and technical architects work side by side with McKinsey strategists, digital experts, and industry specialists. They also work with designers who can help visualize the complex output of a data model for an application or user interface. In addition to serving clients, the team has been actively building an analytics community in Singapore. They are collaborating with academics at three local universities on topics such as Explainable AI (XAI) and Kedro , an open-source software tool QuantumBlack released in June. They are also participating in conferences and competitions, and hosting a series of meetups for young tech professionals. Meanwhile, in Japan, McKinsey partner and now QuantumBlack leader Tomoharu Hirayama, believes that many businesses are at a turning point. “Many of our clients here have done a data-driven proof of concept or a use case or two, enough for leaders to recognize that analytics now has to be a core competency,” Tomoharu explains. Tomoharu and his team have helped retailers and consumer product companies use analytics to fine-tune pricing and product assortment and they’ve also helped financial-services institutions use the technology to generate leads and reduce risk. Elsewhere, they’ve taught a heavy equipment manufacturer how to use data to sharpen operations. “With the QuantumBlack protocol, we can help businesses advance from one-off use cases and apply analytics to reinvent core processes, such as automotive production lines and pharmaceutical research and development,” he says. Like their counterparts in Singapore, the analytics team in Tokyo is also building local ties. They recently participated in a symposium on artificial intelligence (AI) for social good, and they will be hosting a series of meetups for data professionals while continuing their outreach to local start-ups. “Regardless of location, all QuantumBlack clients benefit from our global network,” Jeremy is quick to point out. “This includes knowledge sharing from on-the-ground cases in our client work as well as our research with academia on issues such as XAI. People with unique experience can move throughout the QuantumBlack network and work with clients where needed.” Both Singapore and Tokyo will integrate with the firm’s Sydney location, completing the QuantumBlack circuit in Asia. Where might they head next? “Our global network is enough now that we can serve clients wherever we are,” Jeremy said. “For the time being, this is about right.” related QuantumBlack opens in Montreal, a leading center of AI Revving up analytics in Latin America with QuantumBlack Never miss a story"

July 10, 2019 Diversity matters . For more than a decade, our firm has been making the business case for it, and we have also been working to build diverse and inclusive spaces at McKinsey and beyond. In that spirit, Muslim colleagues hosted 50 executives for our second annual Eid al-Fitr event last month in New York. The theme for this year’s forum was “empowerment.” The event included an afternoon of sessions on how Muslim Americans can work toward civic, social, and political inclusion, and help support and advance Muslim executives. The evening program included a dinner, a keynote address from McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader , and an executive panel featuring Harvard University professor Marshall Ganz , The Markup general counsel Nabiha Syed , and former Informatica chairman and CEO Sohaib Abbasi . “In Islam, leadership is a trust (amanah),” says Naufal Khan , a senior partner and organizer of the event. “This is core to our McKinsey values where we see ourselves as servant leaders partnering with our clients and colleagues who put their faith in us every day.” In his opening remarks, Naufal laid out some of the challenges the Muslim community faces in the professional world. According to a Pew Research Center study , 75 percent of Muslims believe there is discrimination against them in the United States, and a Carnegie Mellon University study found that Muslim job candidates had a 13 percent lower callback rate compared with other job candidates during the hiring process. Several attendees offered personal anecdotes from their own experiences. Organizing as a constituency – and having a shared purpose – is what’s critical towards seeing real change. “We’ve come a long way towards greater inclusion and advancement of minorities in corporate America,” said Umran Beba , senior vice president and chief diversity and engagement officer at PepsiCo. “But when it comes to religion, that’s still something many feel should be left at the door.” One attendee explained that embracing her identity as a Muslim has been a critical aspect of her success. “Having the conviction and confidence to be true to who you are has far-reaching implications for one’s success and ability to lead,” she said. “It’s important to figure out your leadership style. People will respect you more for it.” That comment resonated with the entire room. As people have risen through the ranks in their respective companies, many talked about how important it was for them to feel a greater sense of ease in fully expressing themselves as Muslims among colleagues at work. “When I knew I had the full support of the CEO, I don’t think he realized he had inadvertently given me the confidence to express myself as a Muslim,” said an attendee. “The onus is on us as leaders to be open about who we are as we progress within our organizations. This sends a powerful message to more junior colleagues who are looking to us to lead by example.” Leading, though, is just one part of fostering greater inclusivity. “ Organizing as a constituency – and having a shared purpose – is what’s critical towards seeing real change,” argued Professor Ganz, who has spent much of his life and career devoted to union, political, and community organizing for human, civil, and workers’ rights. Professor Ganz, the son of a rabbi and a teacher, stressed this point by quoting Hillel: “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? When I am for myself alone, what am I? And if not now, when?” He called on everyone in the room to make their voices heard, whether that be with politicians, boards, or fundraising within their communities. “If you don’t author your own story of self, others will author it for you, and it may not be what you want to hear.” In one of the event’s most inspiring moments, Carbonite CEO Mohamad Ali described how he had done just that when he stood with Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in January 2017 as she announced a lawsuit that challenged  the travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Rather than be silent, he chose to use his identity as a Muslim to speak out. “If we work together, there’s tremendous power to create change,” says Naufal. “We have an entire future generation that’s depending on us to do so.” Never miss a story"

Today, we assign that term to any number of big and bold ambitions, but it wasn’t that long ago when the word was used to describe one thing and one thing only: a chance to take humankind forward in a single, seemingly impossible, “giant leap.” This weekend, our firm joins the rest of the world in saluting NASA and the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing, which over July 20 and 21, 1969, saw the Apollo 11 Lunar Module touch down on the moon and Neil Armstrong become the first person to set foot on the lunar surface. We also use this occasion to look back at the tremendous opportunity we had to work with the organization. In the early 1960s, NASA asked our firm to help determine how best to use industry and private institutions in its work, including what the division of labor should look like between government and industry for the burgeoning space program. We also reviewed and evaluated the organizational plan and nature of the institution’s prospective operations. Around that time, McKinsey also began work with NASA’s Space Task Group, the organization charged with managing manned spaceflight programs beginning with Project Mercury, the United States’ first human-in-space program. Working with the Space Task Group and other areas of the agency, McKinsey was privileged to  help NASA both develop its unique organizational structure and make better use of its research capabilities. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, our firm was actively involved in the development of NASA’s Space Shuttle program, helping the agency’s Space Transportation System adopt lessons from the business world that would help an organization built for research and development learn how to thrive. They certainly have. To date, NASA’s more than 130 space shuttle missions have put over 800 people into outer space, and its shuttles have orbited earth more than 20,000 times. “The bar for excellence on Earth was set on the moon 50 years ago this weekend,” says North America Managing Partner Liz Hilton Segel . “Even with half a century gone by, our work with NASA at the dawn of the space age still makes us feel immensely proud and humbled.” Never miss a story"

From left: Joachim Klintfält, Pad Paper Team; Anett Tarnokova, senior recruiter, McKinsey; Gerda Larsson, cofounder and managing director, The Case For Her; Mark Terkelsbøl, kneeling, and Nicolas Housted, Pad Paper Team; and Tey Bannerman, design director, McKinsey. July 23, 2019 Empathy is the foundation of great design, and wherever there’s a lack of one you’re unlikely to find much of the other. That’s often the case when it comes to menstruation. Just talking about periods remains a social and cultural taboo in many parts of the world, and things like good information and affordable, effective, well-designed products are far too often hard to come by for women who need them. Our firm is helping to change that. McKinsey Design is a sponsor of the D&AD New Blood Awards . Often called the “Oscars of the design world,” they help to identify the next generation of creative talent—both students and working designers—under the age of 24. The awards themselves are designated as “ Pencils, ” with four levels of achievement. This year, we partnered with The Case For Her , a non-profit organization dedicated to improving women’s and girls’ health, and laid out a challenge: “End the stigma. Period.” It was a call for young designers to create an innovative service, product, or campaign that addresses the social stigma and practical issues related to menstruation. They didn’t disappoint. According to Nick Whiting , a senior expert with McKinsey Design who served as a judge this year, the response was “amazing.” “We had some 18,000 downloads from 95 countries—and ultimately 300-plus solutions,” says McKinsey senior recruiter Anett Tarnokova , who leads our partnership with D&AD. “There was an incredible diversity of approaches from practical medical devices to daring social-media campaigns,” says Nick. “Entries focused on sexual, political, legal, and socioeconomic aspects; they addressed many different parties, from homeless women, to dads, to boyfriends, and teachers. Seeing so many eye-opening ideas from all over the world, one after the other, gave me goose bumps.” In the end, a stunningly simple idea from three young men in the Danish School of Media and Journalism snagged the highest honor: a Black Pencil, awarded for truly groundbreaking work. It went to Pad Paper : sanitary pads wrapped on a cardboard tube, like bathroom tissue. In some countries, including the United Kingdom and United States, sanitary pads and tampons are assessed a luxury tax. But the way that Pad Paper is packaged qualifies it as a basic necessity, thereby bypassing the tax. “When we heard about the luxury tax on pads, we quite quickly agreed to look for a creative way to avoid it,” explained Mark Terkelsbøl, one member of the winning team. “We made Pad Paper as simple as possible, so when we told people about the tax issue, they instantly understood what the purpose of this product was. It also meant we could position it as an innovation for all period brands, rather than just as a one-brand initiative.” In addition, two entries won Graphite Pencils for original, inspiring work. On It is a period-education card game for kids of all ages, and Everybody Bleeds is an adhesive bandage shaped like a sanitary pad designed to reduce the stigma of bleeding. A portion of Everybody Bleeds’ profits will support non-profit organizations. Period Academy , which helps educate fathers about their daughter’s periods, won a Yellow Pencil for true creative excellence. In addition to the competition, McKinsey Design ran four workshops with 120 students in Berlin, London, Stockholm, and Milan, linked by video conference. Based on our own design sprints, the workshops took a persona-based approach: in this case, the role of dads in menstruation. “It was an opportunity for the students to see the topic from a specific angle and very much mirrored the way we think about and design products here at McKinsey,” says Nick. “Participants had the chance to meet experts in the overall subject—menstruation—and also design professionals to hopefully pick up some tips and tricks,” says Nick. “The inspiration for the D&AD brief itself was drawn from research done in Nepal in 2017 by The Case For Her,” explains Anett. As has been reported in the news, the country has some of the most negative attitudes toward menstruation worldwide. The Case For Her conducted extensive ethnographic interviews across 12 locations in Nepal with adolescent girls, their peers, family members, and teachers to better understand their experiences. “When girls have their first periods, many of them have no idea what is happening,” points out Gaelle le Gelard , a McKinsey designer who worked with the non-profit on a pro bono basis, helping to translate the raw research data into a design framework for developing tangible solutions. “There is a lack of education on the topic because of the many taboos surrounding it; mothers often don't dare to speak to daughters, and daughters fear the stigmas.” “Any solution for managing menstruation had to be thought through as part of an ecosystem rather than one killer idea,” Gaelle explains, “and work across different locations, family situations, and a range of audiences.” Gerda Larsson is the co-founder and managing director of The Case For Her. “It has been tremendously gratifying,” she says, “to see our efforts grow from a single research initiative in Nepal to partner with McKinsey Design on a high-profile competition that amplified our message across the globe and drew 300-plus solutions.” related Announcing our first D&AD New Blood Awards: 8 ingenious solutions to help ‘unbanked’ communities Never miss a story"
"A festival of ideas, shaped by McKinsey insight","We led conversations on women and leadership, trust and technology, climate change and business, and the future of work at the 2019 Aspen Ideas Festival.",2019-07-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20festival%20of%20ideas%20shaped%20by%20mckinsey%20insight/aif-hero.jpg,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-festival-of-ideas-shaped-by-mckinsey-insight,"A festival of ideas, shaped by McKinsey insight McKinsey has been an Aspen Ideas Festival Knowledge Partner since 2017. (Property of the Aspen Institute / Photo Credit: Dan Bayer) July 31, 2019 “The numbers are stunning,” the FT’s Gillian Tett said of our climate-change research in Aspen, Colorado, last month. “I would challenge anyone who sees [them] to walk away and just say, ‘whatever.’” That’s one example of how McKinsey insights shaped conversations this year at the 2019 Aspen Ideas Festival , where our firm once again served as Knowledge Partner. An annual non-partisan event held by the Aspen Institute , the Ideas Festival is dedicated to discussing the biggest issues shaping our times. Every June, the event brings together hundreds of luminaries from the worlds of business, government, art, media, and sport. Speakers this year included the likes of Mark Zuckerberg , Janet Napolitano , the rap artist Common , the New Yorker’s Masha Gessen , the NBA’s Kevin Love , and more. Four of our colleagues joined that esteemed company, presenting throughout the week some of McKinsey’s latest research on issues that matter hugely to businesses and society alike. Here’s what they shared. Andre Dua on “The Zip Code Reality” Andre Dua , a senior partner at our firm who founded and leads McKinsey’s higher-education work , laid out a fact base for one of the most talked-about conversations at this year’s Ideas Festival: “ The Zip Code Reality: Where You Live Matters .” Citing our firm’s long program of research around the future of work , Andre shared an early look at our newest report on the topic, published July 11, called “ The future of work in America: People and places, today and tomorrow .” The New York Times’s David Brooks , former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker , and San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President and CEO Mary Daly took the stage after Andre’s presentation, citing our work frequently in their remarks. Andre’s talk focused specifically on our efforts to project the impact of automation over the next 10 years at as granular a level as we could understand it. While much of the public conversation on this issue has been about jobs lost and jobs displaced, he said, the more important story is one about transformation. About 40 percent of U.S. jobs, Andre explained, are currently in occupational categories that could shrink over the next decade. Many of them feature routine or physical tasks, and the jobs with the greatest displacement potential, he added, overlap with those that have lower educational requirements. Different demographic groups will therefore differently feel the impact of automation. “Individuals with a high school diploma or less are four times more likely to be in an automatable job than someone with a bachelor’s degree or higher,” Andre said. “And they are 14 times more likely to be in an automatable job than someone with a graduate degree.” About midway through his talk, Andre shared a map our firm produced to review all of the counties in the U.S. “We looked at the composition of jobs in each economy, the skills required for those jobs, and which of those skills are automatable,” he said. “Based on that, we made predictions about job losses and job gains.” What our firm found was that the story about the future of work is not a simplistic narrative about rural versus urban, or one region of the country versus another. We have a real opportunity to respond locally,” he added, “to reflect local economic circumstances. Instead, our research shows that the future of work is shaping up to be a granular story about specific differences in communities. Andre reminded the audience how important it is to not lose sight of the fact that behind the numbers, such as the millions of jobs that will be transformed, there are individual human stories of real pain and real disruption that must be accounted for. So what do we do? According to Andre, the communities where progress on this front is being made feature the full ecosystem of players—companies, educational institutions, governments, NGOs, labor unions, and so on—coming together. “We’re going to need to more fully deploy and scale things that we are seeing working in some parts of the country to others,” Andre said. With this research, he added, “we have a real opportunity to respond locally, to reflect local economic circumstances.” Lareina Yee on “Breaking Barriers” Our chief diversity and inclusion officer Lareina Yee kicked off the week with a conversation called “ Breaking Barriers: Women Defining Leadership ,” where she laid out a fact-base and then joined a discussion with leaders from business, tech, and beyond. Pamela Reeves , a senior fellow in international and public policy at Brown University and founder of Reeves Advisory, moderated. According to our latest Women in the Workplace report, Lareina explained, women today are outnumbered five to one in the C-suite, and only 79 women for every 100 men are promoted to manager. Those numbers, she added, are even bleaker for women of color, who are outnumbered 25 to one in the C-suite. Only 60 Black women for every 100 men, Lareina added, are promoted to manager. Lareina’s fellow panelists talked about the impact these trends can have on women’s advancement. Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of Business Development Peggy Johnson talked about her early career, when she almost left engineering because of the feedback she was getting on performance reviews that measured things like assertiveness but not collaboration. Peggy’s manager at the time lobbied for changes to the review process. Yet our research shows that women don’t receive that kind of support often enough. Managers, Lareina explained, are less likely to help women navigate office politics than men, and women are also less likely to be given the resources they need to succeed. At least one young woman is undaunted by these barriers. Lareina’s fellow panelist Lauren Simmons, who at just 23 years old became the New York Stock Exchange’s youngest female equity trader and only the second African American woman to hold that position in the exchange’s 227-year history, offered one of the event’s most memorable quotes. “We don’t need gatekeepers,” she said, “to make our dreams a reality.” Our firm is optimistic about the future of women at work. According to Lareina, who leads our global technology hardware and services work , some 164 million new jobs—or 10 percent of employment in 2030—could be created in entirely new occupations as automation transforms the economy. If governments, companies, and individuals invest in the right training programs for women to develop the necessary skills; develop the support networks they need to boost labor mobility and flexibility; and improve their access to technology, Lareina said, the barriers women face today might soon, and finally, fall. Dickon Pinner on “Climate Breaking Points” McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice co-founder and leader Dickon Pinner joined the FT’s Gillian Tett , Prudential’s Phil Waldeck , and Oxford Professor Cameron Hepburn for a session called “Climate Breaking Points: Business Strategies to Mitigate Economic and Social Risks.” At the start of the panel, Dickon made the case for two climate-related actions: decarbonization and climate resiliency. Explaining how businesses are critical to reversing climate change, he argued that executives need access to the best available climate data, forecasting techniques, and risk analytics. Companies tend to be preoccupied with the cost of making climate-related business changes, Dickon explained. Yet they are often less aware of the huge potential financial losses they already face, especially as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe. For instance, McKinsey assessed the financial records of ten large power utilities in seven U.S. states where hurricanes are common. We found that over a 20-year period a typical utility could see $1.4 billion in storm-damage costs, losing significant revenues due to storm outages along the way. Effectively for investors, numbers like that amount to debt that organizations are exposed to, explained Phil. If they are made aware of it, the volume of that exposure can have an impact on the will of people to act. “There’s a word for this,” Phil added, “it’s called leverage.” Cameron echoed this point. Boards and companies all around the world, he explained, should understand that they have deep supply chain risks. “The reality,” he said, “is that there are a lot of people exposed who don’t know they’re exposed.” Our view at McKinsey, Dickon explained, is that by converting good science to numbers that help organizations see the potential business risks of not addressing climate change, we can seize this extraordinary moment and make real progress. Michael Chui on “Can We Trust Tech?” Michael Chui , a partner with the McKinsey Global Institute , sat down with Craigslist Founder Craig Newmark , former Facebook chief security officer and Stanford research professor Alex Stamos , Stanford Center for Ethics in Society professor Rob Reich , and Aspen Tech Policy Hub Director Betsy Cooper for a lively conversation about how to build technology and solutions for good that encourage trust. The chat began as a looser version of a McKinsey problem-solving session, which saw Michael ask each panelist to frame the challenge they face when it comes to tech and trust. For Alex, who headed up Facebook’s investigation into alleged foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, the answer was simple: stopping “bad guys from doing bad things with computers,” he said. To that end, Alex and his colleagues have created the Stanford Internet Observatory, a program designed to help organizations of all kinds better see the internet, as he put it. In the same way that astronomers use a celestial observatory to understand what’s happening in space, Alex explained, researchers can use the Internet Observatory to see and respond to what happens online. In theory, some of those responses could take the form of tech-driven policy, which is the big issue Betsy and the Aspen Tech Policy Hub are trying to address. This program accepts mid-career technology professionals as fellows and provides them with practical training in policy development, as they develop solutions to real-life policy problems. Merging the values of tech with the values of the world beyond tech lies at the heart of Rob Reich’s academic work, which involves using lessons from the humanities to inform the decisions engineers and other technologists make. What he has in mind, he explained, is to follow the lead of schools that teach law and medicine—which provide instruction in ethics and morality—to build lessons into engineering curricula that teach engineers how to make decisions that are good for business, good for technology, and good for society. Craig Newmark, through his organization Craig Newmark Philanthropies , works toward the same aim in his efforts to “ protect the values that America aspires to .” In particular, his group focuses on protecting a free press, voter rights, advancing women in tech, and supporting veterans and military families. It’s not easy to do. Perhaps the most well-known technologist onstage that afternoon, Craig talked about the challenge developers face from bad actors like hackers, while also admitting that technologists themselves also bring certain inherent flaws to their work. “Sometimes in our excitement for the technology,” he said, “we don’t consider the unanticipated consequences.” related SXSW Interactive 2019: The big ideas that got us talking Four McKinsey leaders share their advice for early-career women Never miss a story"

It’s a difficult mission. Like any city, Atlanta has communities that are affected by poverty and other social challenges. The right answer in one neighborhood might prove ineffective elsewhere. The organization created the Child Well-Being Index to help address this. A data set that tracks the welfare of the city’s 1.3 million children, the index has been a powerful tool for the organization. But not long ago, United Way leaders wanted to find a better way to use of all of the information the index provides. They reached out to Steve Reis , a senior partner in McKinsey’s Atlanta office, for help. Specifically, United Way wanted to find new ways to derive insights from the data, measure return on investment, and identify better interventions and new partners. Steve mobilized a team of nine local business analysts who would work on a pro bono basis for the organization. Their work was so well received that United Way recognized McKinsey with its 2019 Volunteerism Champion Award earlier this year. Our social responsibility “The work McKinsey did on our Child Well-Being Index has fundamentally changed the way we track our progress and determine what programs are most effective,” says Ginneh Baugh , VP of strategy and knowledge development at United Way. “McKinsey’s work has enabled us to better steer resources where they’re needed most and measure progress over time.” According to Will Whitehurst , a senior business analyst who is currently on secondment with the Atlanta Committee for Progress , the index takes into account how children, their families, and their communities are faring. It includes figures like the percentage of low-weight births, families with financial instability, and adults without health insurance. “The biggest challenge United Way faced on this issue,” says Julie Spangler , a business analyst who worked on the project, “was identifying the kind of support and programming youth within each community needed.” To help United Way get better insights that could fulfill that objective and others, our team created a platform that produces a composite score showing where in the city children are most vulnerable to issues like poor health, school absenteeism, poverty, and homelessness. It has already produced real results. UPS, for example, worked with United Way to use the index when they were searching for a location for their new Atlanta smart hub , an advanced 1.2 million square-foot ground package processing facility. They strategically chose to place the hub in an area with a low index score, where people lacked access to employment and high-wage potential, in an effort to turn the community around. The UPS center even went so far as to align work shifts with the city’s public transportation schedule, so local residents could easily catch the bus or train home. “Transportation and housing are some of the biggest expenses for families,” says Ginneh. “Having the ability to ease the burden for people in these communities so they can get to work is significant.” Pulling data from the index, the McKinsey team has also built an interactive heat map that shows the Child Well-Being Scores of each zip code. This feature lets users see at-a-glance which areas are most at-risk (rendered in red and orange on the map) and double-click to find out what specific child, family, and community measures look like there. Three years ago, 36 percent of United Way’s funding went to areas in what are now red and orange zones on the map. This year, up to 48 percent of funding goes to those areas. “This is really powerful for both donors and partner organizations,” says Austin Smith , a McKinsey business analyst and member of United Way team. “Right away they can determine where to direct their efforts and spending.” The next iteration of the map will include information on youth-education providers, showing which ones are serving children in which neighborhoods. This feature will give United Way a more holistic view of its existing and potential partners across the Atlanta area to ensure kids receive the schooling they need. The future could be bright for these children, and it’s on each of us to make sure that it will be. The Child Well-Being Index’s scoring system also helps measure United Way’s progress. One neighborhood, for example, saw their index score rise from 58.9 to 61.8. That equates to a change in the lives of over 82,000 children in the region living in low or very low Child Well-Being Score neighborhoods. “We’re on track to reaching our goal of improving the lives of 250,000 children by 2027,” says Ginneh. If the success of the Child Well-Being Index initiative is any indication, that goal is well within this organization’s reach. “It’s been incredible to see the whole Atlanta office really get behind our work with United Way,” says Will. “The future could be bright for these children, and it’s on each of us to make sure that it will be.” related Our newest solution brings  ‘City Voices’ into government decision making Never miss a story"
An inside look at how the McKinsey Global Institute creates a better understanding of the world,"In this interview, McKinsey Global Institute chairman and director James Manyika explains what makes our think tank’s research stand out.",2019-08-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Awards,McKinsey Global Institute,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-the-mckinsey-global-institute-is-changing-the-way-we-think-about-work-gender-equality-and-more,"An inside look at how the McKinsey Global Institute creates a better understanding of the world August 16, 2019 The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) was named the world’s number one private-sector think tank by the University of Pennsylvania’s Lauder Institute in its 2018 Global Go To Think Tank Index report , which was published  early this year. MGI has now topped the list four years running. For nearly 30 years, MGI’s reports have influenced key decision makers in business, the nonprofit sector, and government, but what is it that sets MGI apart? How has it earned its reputation? And who, exactly, is its audience? To answer these questions and more, we recently talked to James Manyika , MGI chairman and one of its three directors. What sets MGI apart from other think tanks? We do research that’s relevant for business and for the economy, so we think about MGI’s audience as being leaders in the private sector, policy, and government. We see our function as doing fact-based research that informs their decision making. Does that include policy research? MGI is not a policy shop, and we don’t give any policy prescriptions. And quite often, people are disappointed when they read our reports: they expect there’s going be that final chapter where we prescribe policy. Well, that chapter doesn’t exist, and it’s quite deliberate. We see our role as developing a fact base that can inform our leaders as they make policy and other decisions. Based on our research findings, we do try to highlight the biggest problem for leaders to solve. What do you find particularly distinctive about MGI? We’re relatively unique in the sense that we have complete independence in what we look at. We occupy this interesting space between business research and academic research, and we take the best of both worlds. Every time we do any research project, we have academic advisors who critique, challenge, advise, and collaborate with us, helping us to hold our research to the highest standards. We occupy this interesting space between business research and academic research, and we take the best of both worlds. We’ve also been very lucky to have several leading economists, including several Nobel laureates, be advisors of our work. In our history they have included Nobel laureates like Robert Solow , Ken Arrow , Paul Romer , and others like Olivier Blanchard and Dani Rodrik . Today, they include Laura Tyson , a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley; Michael Spence , a Nobel laureate in economics and professor of economics at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business; Richard Cooper , a professor of international economics at Harvard University; Erik Brynjolfsson , director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy and professor of management at MIT Sloan; Matt Slaughter , dean and professor of international business at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth; Sir Christopher Pissarides , a Nobel laureate and professor of economics and political science at the London School of Economics; Diana Coyle , professor of public policy, University of Cambridge; Martin Baily , a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings Institution; and Rakesh Mohan , a professor at Yale School of Management and senior fellow at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. I think all of that is what makes MGI unique. What makes MGI research noteworthy? We see our value in what we call “micro to macro,” meaning that we try and work on research where you can observe the microeconomics on the ground, inside companies, inside sectors, and in particular places. That micro understanding of how business and the economy works then allows us to have a point of view on the macro. This is one of the benefits of being part of McKinsey—the ability to access this micro perspective—which then allows us to have a point of view on the macro. How do you put that micro-to-macro perspective to work? We can apply this approach in a few programmatic areas—for example, technology and its impact on business and the economy. We tend to look at labor markets, at globalization, and at global trade. And we also look at questions, from time to time, that have to do with environmental impacts and natural resources and how they intersect with business and the economy. What’s your favorite story about MGI research addressing real-world problems? Over the years, we’ve had an impact in so many different ways. For example, we’ve been doing work on labor markets in the US economy for many, many years: how employment is changing, how the labor force is changing , and what the skills of the future are likely to be. Over the years, we’ve had an impact in so many different ways. Then four years ago, we collaborated with the Markle Foundation , a nonprofit foundation that does big initiatives every few years to think about how we can take all this research and do something with it in the real world. Markle went on to create Skillful , an initiative that’s doing skills and career matching based on our research. It’s now working in 26 states in very creative public–private partnerships, whereby the governors in those states and a few technology companies have started to apply our research about labor markets across America. Is there a story you’d add that extends beyond the world of work? Our research on gender parity—we did probably what’s considered now one of the largest research efforts to look at gender parity across the world. We looked at 93 countries vis-à-vis a wide range of different indicators for women’s economic participation. The comprehensive nature of that work resulted in the United Nations focusing its women’s initiative on the gender gaps that had been highlighted in our research. Finally, how about innovation? Give us an example of MGI’s ability to pioneer new ideas. We’ve often innovated in different ways to measure things. Several years ago, a big question for everyone was, “How do you even measure the digital economy?” We started sizing the digital economy, starting in the United States, going sector by sector, drawing on the firm’s proprietary data and insights and also using private data, especially on global data flows. Well, it turns out that our approach was ultimately sufficiently interesting to the US Department of Commerce as it was starting to measure the size and scale of the digital economy, as well as data flows. related Happy birthday, McKinsey Global Institute Using economic analysis to take on society’s biggest issues Never miss a story"

August 29, 2019 It’s 2030, and fully autonomous transportation is real. Driverless rideshares are a fact of daily life, and cars are more like moving super computers than, well, cars. This is the not-so-distant future according to the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility , our think tank helping business leaders and policy makers navigate the changing mobility landscape. That reality will be a radical departure from everything we love and hate about getting around today, and designers, engineers, mechanics, and executives across the mobility industry are eager to get ready. To better understand what users will want, the center has partnered with the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering to create the Mobility Experience and Technology (MXT) Lab in Stuttgart, Germany. “This is a space for anyone—from suppliers and manufacturers to entertainment providers and insurance companies—to collaborate and test new mobility experience ideas together,” says Timo Moller , a McKinsey partner and Center for Future Mobility leader. “The ecosystem of mobility players is expanding, and our goal here is to bring them together across industries to create new concepts.” But bringing people together is only part of the lab’s mission. Getting ready for the future of mobility also requires access to the best technology and customer insights, according to Tobias Schneiderbauer , a McKinsey engagement manager and co-leader at the Center for Future Mobility. The lab, he says, provides members across various industries with access to rapid prototype development, online survey design,  and simulation technology. “That’s how we’ll arrive at new business models and innovation processes,” Tobias adds. The interior of tomorrow’s vehicles is a particular focus for the lab. “No longer will external factors, like horsepower, be as relevant when fewer people are owning cars or even driving them,” explains Katharina Petricevic , a McKinsey senior associate. “Plus, increased connectivity to the internet will have users interacting with vehicles in a whole new way.” This introduces opportunities for new onboard services and products, like geo-based promotions that appear across the dashboard when people ride by a retailer’s store. The lab also helps users consider the rider’s experience. Without having to drive or navigate, every person would effectively become a passenger. McKinsey studies reveal that 70 percent of riders would use the time for leisure activities, like watching a movie, reading, or shopping online. Michele Bertoncello , a McKinsey partner in our Automotive & Assembly Practice , says that these mobile data-based services can present a revenue potential of over  $200 billion USD. “And the ubiquity of mobile devices makes the potential of seizing this opportunity possible,” he adds. Riders might also use the time for personal enrichment and professional development. Our research has shown that more customers are looking to be productive while traveling in an autonomous vehicle. For example, one potential in-car activity surfaced within the lab is in-car language learning, which presents another area of opportunity for software and app developers. For designers, developers, or R&D specialists who use the lab, thinking about consumers early on in their research is key. Rather than formulating ideas through instinct or intuition, the lab gives them a chance to ensure new designs are grounded in rigorous research and analysis through demos. To study how in-car language learning would work, for instance, MXT Lab users conducted live tests with a cockpit mockup to refine results and gather immediate reactions. “We built a pretend prototype—or ‘pretotype,’” says Dr. Florian Hermann , the division director of mobility and innovation systems at Fraunhofer IAO,  “which enabled us to simulate and test new kinds of equipment or applications, like augmented reality windshields or AI-based assistant services.” The language-learning pretotype had simulated features like light-source adjustments, vehicle- and road-noise settings, ride feel, and a movable display across the windshield. While a moderator was reading a story to participants, support personnel could adjust features in the vehicle and measure their impact. Experiments like this help researchers gather data that complements survey feedback. For instance, a feature containing optimized temperatures and a breeze of fresh air to support learning concentration generated 90 percent positive ratings in an online survey versus a 100 percent positive rating from those exposed to experiments with it. The MXT Lab convenes different players that may not come together otherwise. Such information is critical for evaluating the true market potential of an idea. “We call this the ‘do-or-don’t’ point,” Michele says. “If it can create value, it’s a go.” For the in-car language learning application, the lab gauged consumers’ willingness to pay for such a service and which price points were most accepted through an online survey. “These kinds of projects are just the beginning,” says Timo. “The MXT Lab convenes different players that may not come together otherwise. We’re seeing that when they do, they’re in for quite a ride.” related Combining design with data to reimagine ridesharing Never miss a story"

These projects, which account for some 14 percent of global GDP, are critical to society, the global economy, and productivity—and they often run late and over budget . “This creates huge inefficiencies,” says McKinsey senior partner Steffen Fuchs . “Imagine the economic opportunity if we could accomplish these projects on time and on budget.” Our firm’s desire to help organizations seize that opportunity is what drew us into the capital projects and infrastructure space, where we have been ranked the top industry consulting firm by ALM Intelligence for the last five years running. Now, that vision takes a big step forward with McKinsey’s acquisition of leading capital-projects consultancy Westney Consulting . Founded by Dick Westney in 1978, Westney is also ranked among the top five capital projects and infrastructure consultancies in the world by ALM and has supported $250 billion of global energy projects since 2012. “Westney has been consistently recognized for having the world’s deepest benchmarks for analyzing and predicting future project performance,” says McKinsey senior partner Filipe Barbosa . “They provide project-cost and schedule-prediction transparency like no one else.” As projects become more complex and unpredictable, being able to derive such critical insights from data is crucial. Much of Westney’s capabilities are derived from its robust projects database, amassed over 40-plus years of consulting, that helps validate project timelines and budgets, improve delivery, and ensure effective project organization. Rather than a traditional bottom-up cost-and-scheduling approach, Westney creates a top-down assessment using data-driven methods of identifying the most realistic ranges of project outcomes. In many ways, this acquisition is an extension of a longstanding partnership between McKinsey and Westney. Over the past 10 years, we’ve worked closely together on over 80 projects that span oil-and-gas, power, mining, and other sectors. Among Westney’s leaders to join our Capital Projects and Infrastructure practice are Keith Dodson and former McKinsey consultant Justin Dahl . “This is a natural and exciting progression to our long-term relationship with McKinsey,” says Dick Westney. “Combining McKinsey’s global reach, capabilities, and insights with Westney’s pattern-recognition power will significantly expand our clients’ abilities to benchmark large capital projects and locate specific drivers of cost overruns, delays, and quality issues to make better decisions.” While sectors like retail or manufacturing have reaped productivity gains from digital technology, digitization in construction has evolved at a glacial pace . “An industry like construction is ripe for a productivity boost,” says McKinsey partner Kassia Yanosek . “What’s needed is exactly what Westney provides: an independent source of truth for clients at the onset of engagements, so project owners and contractors know exactly what they’re getting into and can plan accordingly.” Westney’s rich data set builds on McKinsey’s existing Energy Insights capabilities and Major Project Delivery expertise that are already leading to an average 20 to 40 percent productivity increase on major projects. “With Westney, we’ll be able to provide insights faster and more effectively,” says Filipe. For example, having greater foresight into projects’ costs, timelines, and skilled labor demands could help ensure every dollar is used as efficiently as possible. “We’ll be able to give owners and contractors better visibility into outcomes across every single stage of a project,” adds Steffen, “leading to more effective capital allocation across the private and public sector.” McKinsey partner Jimmy Nowicke agrees. “On numerous occasions, we’ve collaborated with Westney on client projects to provide unbiased facts and targeted interventions early on,” he says. “We’re excited to now be working as one McKinsey team to help clients translate the data generated on major projects into actionable insights.” Never miss a story"
How the paths of McKinsey alumni have changed over the last decade,"Ten years ago, alums tended to land in finance and private-equity. Now they also look to tech, retail, the social sector, and beyond.",2019-09-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20the%20paths%20of%20mckinsey%20alumni%20have%20changed%20over%20the%20last%20decade/alum-story-9-20-better.jpg,Alumni,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-the-paths-of-mckinsey-alumni-have-changed-over-the-last-decade,"How the paths of McKinsey alumni have changed over the last decade September 20, 2019 Ten years ago, when a McKinsey consultant left the firm, chances were they headed toward a bank, private equity group, or another professional service firm—in London, New York, Berlin, or another big city. But as our firm changed more in the past decade than at any other time in its entire 96-year history, so did our alumni network. We’ve integrated analytics , AI , digital , design , and other capabilities into the new ways we work with our clients. We’ve opened new offices in 41 cities, many of which lie in emerging markets across Africa, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. And we’ve grown; McKinsey today is 30,000 colleagues strong. So today, that same consultant leaving our firm might launch a mobile healthcare service in India. Or develop self-driving cars in California. Or – heading even farther afield, to the stratosphere – lead a startup to clean up space debris. We were looking for new ways to understand and share what our alumni network was doing. That got our Alumni Relations team thinking: how exactly have all the changes our firm has undergone over the last decade played out among our alumni community, which now comprises some 35,000+ members around the world? Alumni Relations Manager Mike Roberto , who joined the firm after serving in a variety of analytics roles in the U.S. Marine Corps, took on the challenge of answering that question. “We were looking for new ways to understand and share what our alumni network was doing,” explains Mike, “and then I began researching our archives and came across insights we had from 2009. Since that time, the alumni tech infrastructure has been upgraded three times, each with a different industry/functional taxonomy and data schema. That posed some challenges, but after processing, mapping, and tying everything together, we got a pretty complete picture.” According to Global Leader of Alumni Strategy and Engagement Michelle Forrest , having a more complete picture would help their team better serve the McKinsey alumni community. “We intuitively knew how quickly our firm was changing,” she says, “but the analysis of 35,000+ people over 10 years provided the empirical proof.” The first thing that jumped out to Mike and Michelle is how our alumni population has ballooned over the last decade in emerging markets, more than doubling and creating a presence in 20 more countries than in 2009. There are individuals behind these statistics, and that’s where Alumni Relations Lead Writer and Researcher Heather Gessino-Kraft comes in. Part of her role is to bring our alumni stories to life, as she identifies interesting work that our former colleagues are doing around the world. For example, Zoë Ng is co-founder of Raintree Development , which offers innovative office spaces in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Joe Mbulu is CFO of Union Bank in Nigeria. And Sanzhar Zharkeshov was recently appointed Vice Minister of Ecology, Geology, and Natural Resources in Kazakhstan. Looking across industries, tech has seen the biggest jump. Today about 17 percent – or nearly one in five alumni – are involved in some way, whether it’s joining tech behemoths such as Google and Apple, running departments or divisions in mid-size companies, or launching startups of their own. We intuitively knew how quickly our firm was changing, but the analysis of 35,000+ people over 10 years provided the empirical proof. Meanwhile, some McKinsey alums are even developing technologies that didn’t exist ten years ago. Sterling Anderson co-founded Aurora, for instance, which creates the underlying technology for self-driving cars. Arnaud Valleille heads up robotics innovation at JPMorgan Chase. And Andras Forgacs co-founded Modern Meadow, a company that uses bio-fabrication to produce sustainable leather. After tech, McKinsey alumni are most frequently moving into the retail/consumer and healthcare industries, with more than 10 percent joining these companies and institutions. This is a natural outgrowth of their experience in helping clients engage customers, partners, patients, and users through new analytics and digital platforms, services and offerings. Meaghan Rose , for instance, created Rocksbox, a jewelry membership service; Oliver Kharraz-Tavakol and Cyrus Massoumi founded Zocdoc, a digital healthcare marketplace that streamlines finding and booking doctors; and Neil Kumar founded BridgeBio, an umbrella organization whose startups focus on diseases caused by genetic defects. In addition, alumni in the data’s top selected functions saw the largest growth in operations and manufacturing, and nearly 10 percent of alumni today are working in careers that help them make a positive contribution to society, choosing government and social sector organizations where they are working to improve education, economic development, agriculture and public health on national and local levels. These former colleagues include Andrew Morlet , CEO of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation; Gustavo Lopetegui , Argentina's Energy Secretary; Naheed Nenshi , Mayor of Calgary; and Peter Sands , Executive Director of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. While much has changed, including the rise of former firm members going into roles around operations and manufacturing, some things have not. Alumni presence in financial services remains strong, and general management and strategy remain the most likely roles alumni will take on. There is, however, one rising trend that could be a challenge to track. “That’s our growing class of ‘boomerangers,’” says Heather. “These are alumni who return for a second stint at McKinsey, bringing their invaluable experiences to entrepreneurial firm roles and new opportunities to serve clients.” related What do these 13 start-ups have in common?

Those authors include eminent historians and economists, AI experts and journalists, and a former head of a central bank. Together, their books cover the global economy, capitalism, innovation, machine learning, gender and pay, community and social capital, markets, and more. Three of the titles examine the extraordinary power of data, from systematically diminishing the lives of women on a daily basis to enabling the conquest of entire financial markets. One book shines a light on the secretive, five-decade story of Koch Industries. And the final two offer more human perspectives: the power of community to ease economic inequity and the benefits of being a generalist and “dabbler” in a highly specialized world. FT editor Lionel Barber is chairing the judges panel, who will select a winner of the award and the £30,000 prize that will be presented in New York on December 3. Here’s a look at some of the best business reading this year. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power By Shoshana Zuboff A first-of-its-kind look at the what it means to be human in the digital age, this book uncovers how corporations are using technology to predict, control, and profit from our behavior in myriad ways with little or no oversight: welcome to the world of surveillance capitalism. Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men By Caroline Criado Perez This book delivers a close examination of the ways that intrinsic bias in the data that designers and developers use to create products, services, and experiences chips away at the physical, social, mental, and economic well-being of women. Find out what executives are reading in 2019 The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution By Gregory Zuckerman This is the story of how former Soviet codebreaker and mathematician Jim Simons and his team of “quants”—physicists, computer scientists, and data experts—came to dominate financial markets by using data-fed algorithms to discern and leverage hidden patterns. The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind By Raghuram Rajan This book, by the former head of the Reserve Bank of India and chief economist at the IMF, outlines the potential for stronger local communities to counterbalance the economic and social inequity and despair created by the concentrated powers of global markets and the state. Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America By Christopher Leonard Seven years in the making, this history of Koch Industries traces the corporation’s tremendous success as one of the largest private businesses in worlds. While not ignoring the more familiar angles, it gives the deepest look yet at the distinctive business model that helped fuel the rise of one of the world’s most valuable as well as powerful companies. Range: How Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World By David Epstein This is a treatise in favor of dabblers, procrastinators, and quitters—in other words, generalists who follow their interests and even quit when bored. They may be better prepared to excel than highly trained specialists because they can navigate learning environments that are “wicked,” ambiguous, and unpredictable. related Bad Blood wins 2018 Business Book of the Year Award For your reading list – the shortlist for Business Book of the Year Never miss a story"
Kevin Sneader: “I want us to be more open about who we are”,"In a candid television interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, our global managing partner talks challenges, changes, and why we&rsquo;re choosing to be more open",2019-10-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/kevin%20sneader%20i%20want%20us%20to%20be%20more%20open%20about%20who%20we%20are/amanpour-still-1-1536x864.jpg,Kevin Sneader,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/kevin-sneader-i-want-us-to-be-more-open-about-who-we-are,"Kevin Sneader: “I want us to be more open about who we are” McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader sat down with renowned biographer Walter Isaacson for an in-depth Amanpour & Company interview that aired on September 24. October 2, 2019 During his first year as a McKinsey consultant in 1989, Kevin Sneader was told by colleagues to always have taxis drop him at least two blocks away from client offices. The reason? “Do whatever it takes,” he said, to protect the client’s confidentiality. In an Amanpour & Company interview with Walter Isaacson that aired on September 24, our global managing partner shared that anecdote to illustrate our firm’s historical preference to avoid the spotlight—and to describe how we’re beginning to think differently. We will always protect our client confidences, Kevin said. “But we can be more open about ourselves.” Read on for edited highlights from the conversation. The entire video is available at the Amanpour & Company website . On “seeking the limelight” at McKinsey I don’t think there are many previous global managing partners of McKinsey who’ve ever sat down to have this kind of conversation. We have historically been less than transparent, and that was all grounded in reverence for client confidentiality. It was so pervasive that when I joined the firm back in 1989, one of the first things I got told was when you take a taxi to the client, make sure it drops you two blocks away from the client’s offices. I think times have changed. People want to know more [about McKinsey] We will still protect client confidences. We always will, but we can be more open about ourselves. If you want to have your photo up there and be celebrated as a great success, go to Wall Street, don’t come to McKinsey. You’ll find McKinsey is full of people who are, for example, sons and daughters of educators, as I am; my father is an academic, my mother is a teacher. Our people choose to do what we do because they want to help our clients succeed. This is not the place to be if you want to be in the limelight. If you want to have your photo up there and be celebrated as a great success, go to Wall Street, don’t come to McKinsey. On long termism, business, and communities I think the cliché of ‘doing well by doing good’ is true. If you look at this issue of short-termism, I think there’s no evidence that says those who take a short-term view ultimately do better.  I think a long-term view inevitably leads you down a path that says crude metrics of just a few economic measures aren’t going to tell you whether the health of your business is going to endure. If the community is not doing well and society is not benefiting, ultimately, you’re not going to benefit [as a company] either. On how he got into management consulting I went to Glasgow University, the best university in the world I think. I was president of the student union, which meant we ran the largest bar in Glasgow. One night, I was clearing out the bar and sitting there was a printed brochure for McKinsey. I thought, “that’s interesting.” I sent them a letter and then went down to London for an interview. So, I’d love to tell you I always wanted to be a management consultant, but that would just not be truth. On the automation and the future of work We have a statistic: in 60 percent of today’s jobs, more than 30 percent of the tasks will be completely changed. It’s an industrial revolution, and ultimately more jobs will be created. But the real issue is what happens in this transition? How do you ensure that people get the skills they need to succeed? I’m an optimist. I think there’s a way through this that requires real investment in training and education. On technology and the rise of global inequality I think we have to remind ourselves that the nature of inequality is not straightforward. Why do I say that? There are 1.2 billion people who have actually been taken out of poverty in recent years. So the inequality between countries is actually narrowed. The developing world is catching up. However, within countries, inequality is growing. And to address that, I think there’s a lot of change that is going to have to be embraced. One is a rethinking of education itself to ensure that it’s actually able to deliver the skills to cope with new technologies. And that’s not happening fast enough. I think there also needs to be a hard look at the way in which health care and the cost of education have risen. That’s also a big issue. So there’s a number of places where I think we actually need to look hard at the way in which globalization is working in order to just allow it, to do what it does do well, which is actually promote and narrow the gap between countries. But within countries, it’s a real issue. On our firm’s recent controversies One of the first things I did when I came into the [managing partner role] was I flew to South Africa. I said we got some things wrong, badly wrong. We partnered with the wrong people. Secondly, the way in which we thought about the fees was just wrong. When it comes to that kind of work [in the public sector] we’re going to cap any fee upside because we recognize that it’s just not the kind of environment where you want to have those kinds of [success] fees in place. We’re not going to do anymore work on opioids. We are now 100 percent focused on alleviating the crisis. We’ve invested a lot in having a look at how to bring people together to address this crisis, and if you look, you’ll see we’ve written quite extensively about the way [forward]. So, we have a lot to say about how that can be brought to a place in which communities work together to solve this terrible crisis. It’s not in the world’s interest that Saudi Arabia be de-stabilized or unstable. Youth unemployment in Saudi Arabia is 25 percent. Again, it’s not good if those people don’t have jobs to go to. So, I’m actually quite proud of the work we do in Saudi Arabia, and we are not engaging in work that I think touches on some of the issues that are more problematic about that country. On how we think about serving government clients Over the last couple of years, we have been looking again at the way in which we think about the activities in some countries and really try to draw some lines about where we will not work: we will not work in defense [in certain countries], we will not work in policing, for example. I believe we should engage, but I also recognize that we should engage responsibly. But let me say this: 61 percent of the world, according to Freedom House , doesn’t live in democracies. We, I think, have to decide whether to be engaged with the 61 percent who do not. I believe we should engage, but I also recognize that we should engage responsibly. We’ve put in place and are working through a series of measures to keep focus on ensuring we are on the right side of these issues. On what he’d say if asked for advice on Brexit Well, I’d remind myself and I’d remind the politicians that when you look at the United Kingdom, one of its great challenges is productivity. It has lagged Europe in terms of productivity for the last decade. And if you look at the United Kingdom, I’d say let’s remind ourselves what are the fundamental issues, whether you believe in Brexit or you don’t believe in Brexit, that this country needs to solve? You start with productivity and you look at the various elements that Britain needs to address in order to ensure that it is the successful economy that we all want it to be. On McKinsey then and now Well, we’ve been around since 1926. Originally, our insight was we take science and apply it to the art of business. We help clients solve their toughest problems. That’s still very true. But increasingly what we’re focused on is helping not just solve the problem but achieve an improvement in performance. And so we have, over the years, built up a set of capabilities that allow us to help our clients think about how their business needs to change, what they need to do to take on that change, and over time transform themselves. That’s what we do today. Never miss a story"
A McKinsey LGBTQ+ leader who’s helping to build a global alliance,"Meet one of the driving forces behind The Alliance, our firm&rsquo;s annual forum for leading LGBTQ+ executives.",2019-10-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20mckinsey%20lgbtq%20leader%20building%20a%20global%20alliance/alliance-inline3b-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-mckinsey-lgbtq-leader-building-a-global-alliance,"A McKinsey LGBTQ+ leader who’s helping to build a global alliance Diana Ellsworth, a McKinsey partner speaking to members of The Alliance October 8, 2019 “I’ve often been called the mother hen for our southern office ’ s LGBTQ+ community,” jokes Diana Ellsworth . But this McKinsey partner takes seriously her opportunity to be open and authentic about who she is. A former teacher, Diana is a global co-lead of our firm ’ s worldwide network of LGBTQ+ colleagues, known as GLAM , and she leads our Diversity and Inclusion Practice for the Americas. In 2018, she and another firm partner launched a new kind of McKinsey forum that convened over 115 LGBTQ+ senior business leaders from around the world: The Alliance . “It’s the first global community of its kind,” Diana says. “We’re bringing together prominent leaders across sectors who are dedicated to accelerating positive change in their own organizations and communities.” This September in Florida, the Alliance assembled for the second consecutive year. Across two days of inclusion and diversity programming focusing on personal, organizational, and societal concerns, our firm also previewed new research. Over the course of the past year, the McKinsey team organizing the event conducted interviews and analyzed data on LGBTQ+ people in the workplace . “One of our goals since we first launched The Alliance has been to understand and contribute to new LGBTQ+ research,” says Kevin Major , a McKinsey associate partner. Ana Mendy, a McKinsey partner, shared one of the team’s early findings. “While all women face more obstacles in the workplace than men, queer women are at a particular disadvantage,” she said. “To achieve equality, companies need to turn good intentions into concrete actions.” Organizations that do stand a lot to gain, according to McKinsey research on the business case for diversity . In fact, S&P 500 companies rated more inclusive of LGBTQ+ colleagues show ten-year financial shareholder returns more than twice as high as less-inclusive companies . The Alliance continued its work on the topic as part of this year’s event. Attendees were asked to share their own stories and experiences to provide qualitative aspects of the research that will be released later in 2019. My super powers are energy and resilience, and the closet was holding me back “We want to see how LGBTQ+ leaders’ sense of strength and experience are similar and how they’re different from their non-LGBTQ+ peers,” explains Diana. “This will help illuminate for organizations how they can foster LGBTQ+ employees into leaders and avoid unintended roadblocks.” Some suggestions offered at the event included ensuring fair hiring and promotion practices and offering employees the flexibility to fit work into their lives. One executive expressed a desire to be defined by more than her sexual orientation, a sentiment that resonated widely among those present. “I can do my best work if I’m just authentically myself,” said Beth Ford , president and CEO of Land O’Lakes. “I want to be Beth the CEO, not Beth the gay CEO,” she added. In breakout discussions, participants talked about leadership characteristics, enablers and barriers of success, and coming out at work. An overarching theme throughout was the importance of having a support system and strong interpersonal relationships. “So much of our vision for The Alliance is to create a platform for  senior leaders to connect and expand their own networks,” says Diana. “We often hear people say they have a strong professional network and a strong LGBTQ+ network, but seldomly do they overlap.” The Alliance offers members a platform to do just that: connect globally and surface opportunities to share experience, expertise, and even resources between individuals and institutions. Beyond building connections, The Alliance has set up working groups of members committed to making progress on specific topics, such as building acceptance in regions where LGBTQ+ people are not treated equally. “We’re thinking about how we can use our influence to help convert legal rights into greater social equality and inclusion and identify best practices to implement in companies in those markets,” says Ali Potia, a McKinsey partner and member of this working group. Currently there is a pilot event planned in India for early next year, and members have started working with local leaders there. LGBTQ+ youth is another area with a member-led working group and was a widely-discussed topic. “We need to find ways to enable young people to thrive in educational settings, the workplace, and their personal lives,” says Diana. One way The Alliance is addressing this is by creating a research brief for 2020 outlining the need for more holistic, up-to-date data on LGBTQ+ youth in the US, such as school absenteeism and evidence-based interventions, with the hope of eventually expanding the research globally. “It’s hard to believe that when I joined McKinsey over ten years ago I was the only out colleague in our Southern US region,” says Diana. “I look around today and feel inspired that, as a community, we’re working towards creating visible leadership role models and safe spaces for others to be out all across the world.” related 100 leaders commit to advancing LGBTQ+ diversity Eight messages for future LGBTQ+ leaders Never miss a story"
"At our first Hispanic and Latino Economic Forum, leaders unite to focus on jobs","More than 50 leaders from ten countries and multiple industries gathered in Washington, DC, to explore research and connect over shared experiences.",2019-10-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/first%20hispanic%20and%20latino%20economic%20forum%20unites%20leaders%20on%20the%20jobs%20front/hlef-hero-sm_1303x733.jpg,"Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/first-hispanic-and-latino-economic-forum-unites-leaders-on-the-jobs-front,"At our first Hispanic and Latino Economic Forum, leaders unite to focus on jobs From left: Elizabeth Oliver-Farrow, the recently retired CEO of The Oliver Group; Esther Aguilera, president and CEO of the Latino Corporate Directors Association; Jesus Soto, the COO of Mears Group; Nina Vaca, chairman and CEO of Pinnacle Group; and Lucy Perez, a McKinsey partner. October 9, 2019 In late September, our firm hosted its first Hispanic and Latino Economic Forum in Washington, DC, which may bring to mind data, numbers, and graphs. And there were startling numbers. But there were also stories of war heroes and intrepid families, impromptu problem solving, and an outpouring of lessons learned, resources, and tips. “I was thrilled with the outcome and level of engagement throughout the day,” said Lucy Pérez , a McKinsey partner and cancer research specialist who leads McKinsey’s Hispanic Latino Network (HLN). “What struck me was how the discussion flowed and how we quickly came to a set of priorities to take forward as a community,” Lucy added. “It epitomized the inclusive environment we wanted to set up for the meeting.” The forum was timed with National Hispanic Heritage Month in the US, which begins each year on September 15 and runs through October 15, marking the independence anniversaries for a number of Latin American countries. McKinsey partnered with the Latino Corporate Directors Association (LCDA) for the event.  “This is a powerful and timely partnership,” Esther Aguilera , president and CEO of LCDA. “McKinsey brings research and industry expertise, and our members are industry leaders who are shaping the direction of corporate America.” The 50+ participants represented some ten nationalities, from Brazil to Mexico, Cuba, and Spain. They included company founders, published authors, business and government leaders, media representatives, and social entrepreneurs. Clearly, what’s good for Latinos is good for America. Vivian Riefberg , a McKinsey senior partner, welcomed the group. “Our real objective,” she said, “is how do we help increase economic opportunities and the strength of the Hispanic and Latino community, both within and outside of McKinsey?” The keynote session, led by McKinsey partner Pablo Illanes and Jorge Titinger , a well-known tech entrepreneur and author of Differences That Make a Difference , opened with some striking statistics on the future of work. Today, they explained, Hispanics represent 18 percent of the US population. Together, they would be counted as one of the top ten economies in the world. And by 2050, Hispanics and Latinos will be the majority population in the United States. Yet, due to language, location, education, and other socioeconomic factors, Hispanics will be the single group most affected by the impact of automation on jobs : one in four workers are at risk of being displaced. And despite their growing numbers, Hispanics are underrepresented at every level of corporate America; they are undereducated, underbanked, and underinsured. “With these different factors creating a perfect storm, the time to focus and help is now,” remarked Roel Campos, chairman of LCDA, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed , and former SEC commissioner. “Clearly, what’s good for Latinos is good for America” There are multiple opportunities to address these workforce challenges, from the fundamental issue of changing mind-sets to the more pragmatic goals of developing skills-based training and scaling resources. On the subject of mindsets, Carla Arellano, a McKinsey partner, walked the group through the common myths that hinder Latinas in the workplace: They often quit their job to take care of the family. They aren’t interested in advancing their careers. They don’t want to be leaders. She debunked them one at a time. In fact, only two percent of Latinas leave the workforce for family reasons, and 44 percent have aspirations for advancement—a rate higher, she said, than that of white men and women. Elizabeth Oliver-Farrow , the recently retired CEO of The Oliver Group , a public-policy and communications company, shared this anecdote. “ ‘ Never let them know you are a Latina!’ This was the advice people gave me when I started my own advisory business out of my studio apartment with credit cards. It made me more determined than ever to show who I was and what I could do.” Nina Vaca , chairman and CEO of Pinnacle Group, advised the audience: “Be brave. Don’t be afraid to be the first or the only Hispanic in the room. You are a leader who happens to be Hispanic, and you bring value to the table.” A number of attendees were looking for practical help. One participant asked for input into how he could help the Hispanic workers in his agricultural company make the shift to new technologies. The head of an architecture business wanted guidance on how to recruit Hispanic engineers. “I can help with that,” said another member of the audience, who worked extensively with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Participants shared information about innovative skills-building programs: a nine-month university program that helped actuaries deepen data science skills; an airline’s program that targeted local high-school students with vocational training for on-the-ground jobs; a program of wraparound services that was helping underprivileged students complete college. They also talked about their personal experiences. “Many of the stories people shared had common elements and reminded me of my own story,” said Lucy. “They had newly emigrated or were the first generation of college graduates, had a devoted family life, a strong entrepreneurial streak, and Spanish was the common language. Many HLN colleagues comment on the unique opportunity we have in quickly creating a bond with our Hispanic clients and building a close relationship much faster as a result of the common language and culture.” McKinsey recruits Hispanic candidates through a myriad of programs starting at the high-school level through to graduate business school. “But perhaps the most important aspect to retaining colleagues is by addressing cultural nuances,” explained Ingrid Millán , an associate partner who leads our recruiting efforts. “For example, in Latin America, where an implicit hierarchy is very pronounced, you would never ask for a leading role or activity when you come onto a work team,” says Ingrid. “You wait to be given that chance. Here in the US, if you wait for an opportunity it could be translated into ‘not taking ownership.’” The one thing all Hispanic candidates look for in a company or firm? “Role models,” adds Ingrid. “People want to see people they can relate to—that they can see being successful.” related New research highlights gap between race and earning power in the US: Meet the authors Never miss a story"
The women behind Women in the Workplace,"As the largest study of women's experiences in corporate America turns five, the team who started it all reflects on how it began, the progress made so far, and what&rsquo;s next.",2019-10-17T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20women%20behind%20women%20in%20the%20workplace/women-in-workplace-hero-sm-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Our People,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-women-behind-women-in-the-workplace,"The women behind Women in the Workplace The Women in the Workplace leadership team, from left: Irina Starikova, a McKinsey partner; Alexis Krivkovich, a McKinsey senior partner; Jess Huang, a McKinsey partner; Lareina Yee, a McKinsey senior partner and the firm’s chief diversity and inclusion officer October 17, 2019 “If you’re going to do this, think really, really big.” That’s what a mentor told Lareina Yee and Alexis Krivkovich in 2014 when they shared a budding idea: to apply McKinsey’s business problem-solving approach to help address gender inequality at work. Today, Alexis is a senior and managing partner for our San Francisco office.  Lareina, a senior partner who leads our firm’s High-Tech Infrastructure and Services Practice, is also McKinsey’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. And that idea from 2014? It has blossomed into Women in the Workplace , the largest study of the experience of women and gender inequality in corporate America. Working in partnership with Sheryl Sandberg and LeanIn.org , McKinsey analyzes workplace data and the experiences of men and women to help organizations chart concrete actions and take steps forward. At the launch of the report each year, the Wall Street Journal runs a special section, Women In , and hosts a conference to further explore the challenges in the workplace. This year marks five years of Women in the Workplace. We spoke with Lareina and Alexis who co-lead the effort along with West Coast partners Irina Starikova and Jess Huang to hear more about how it all began, the surprises they’ve met along the way, the progress made so far, and what’s next. McKinsey has been researching gender parity for over 10 years. How did Women in the Workplace take off? Lareina: I didn’t know it would turn into what it is today when it first launched. It was largely born out of our own personal experiences. I had often found myself doubling the population of women in a conference room whenever I entered. I thought to myself, McKinsey solves some of the world’s toughest business problems through analytics.  Why can’t we do the same here,  learn something, and help companies work towards gender diversity? I wanted to team up with someone, and Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In book had just come out. It resonated with a lot of people (plus she’s a McKinsey alum) so I worked with Eric Kutcher , a McKinsey senior partner who became a sponsor of the research, to set up a formal partnership with LeanIn.org since they work individually with women. Alexis: Eric was really committed to getting this off the ground. I remember speaking to him about it while I was on maternity leave after having my third daughter. I thought to myself this was an opportunity to help pave the way for my girls one day. Once I returned back to work a few months later, I got started. Since those early days, how has the report been received? Irina: Inside McKinsey, there’s been a growing understanding of how powerful this research is, and many colleagues are proactively bringing it to their clients. In the earliest days, this work was really driven by Lareina and Alexis. Now, it has become a firm-wide initiative that draws colleagues from all over McKinsey. Jess and I are evidence of that. Jess joined the team last year, and I jumped at the opportunity to be a part of it three years ago. We each do this work in addition to our regular client work, and I think we’d all agree it’s very much a labor of love. Alexis: Outside the firm, there’s definitely been a shift in the quality and sincerity of companies’ engagement on the topic of gender parity. Five years ago, it wasn’t necessarily a standalone priority. If you caught someone in HR or diversity and inclusion, you might get interest in participating. Today, we’re getting outreach from executive leadership teams, and participating companies continually tell us how valuable the insights are. Over the years, we’ve heard more companies tell us that the research outputs have been critical launching points for them, helping to prioritize where to focus. It’s no longer about optics but rather performance and winning the talent game. Companies want to ensure they’re engaging their best future leaders, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other forms of diversity. The numbers say a lot. In five years, we’ve almost tripled the amount of participating companies we get from 118 to 329 this year. McKinsey solves some of the world’s toughest business problems through analytics. Why can’t we do the same here, learn something, and help companies work towards gender diversity? What have you found most surprising from the study? Lareina: I always hoped our research would resonate with women and men, but I didn’t know the extent that it would. I remember being at a client office six months after the first report had been published and seeing it out in a woman’s cubicle. She told me she kept it there to remind herself of the context of the world in which she works and the progress she’s striving towards creating. Irina: I’d add that it is incredible to see how much this research has become known across such a wide range of companies. There is not a single industry, geography, or company size not covered in the registrations we continually receive on the website. What I did not anticipate was the growing number of industry organizations using our data and insights to drive dialogues with companies in their respective industries. This includes organizations, such as Women’s Foodservice Forum , Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association , and Press Forward , to name a few. How has the landscape changed for women in the past five years? Jess: Each year's report tells an important story, but what’s particularly unique about this year is that we could do a comprehensive look back over a longer term. The good news is we are seeing bright spots this year, both in women's representation at the top and in certain elements of women's experiences. There’s finally some movement in the C-suite with a 24 percent increase at this level. But some areas haven’t budged at all. We lose a lot of women very early on in their career at the very first rung of the corporate ladder , and we see many of them getting stuck along the way, particularly women of color.  While the playing field is less tilted, we don’t have equity yet. Companies have more to do and need to work faster. Alexis: What is encouraging, though, is companies’ commitments towards gender diversity. For nearly 90 percent of them, it’s now a top priority, and there’s been a 50 percent increase in commitment to it over the last seven years. Since we started, 600 companies have participated in the study, and more than a quarter of a million people have been surveyed. What we know is that data and language from the report provide colleagues with a fact base of what’s going on. And once you’re armed with that, it’s that much easier to make changes happen. You’ve come this far in five years. What will Women in the Workplace look like after its first decade? Lareina: I’d hope the report will be the definitive guide for companies to make progress, particularly at that first step up, and be a source of insights. I’d like to see in the next five years companies applying the same measures that have been successful at the C-suite to the first-manager promotions.  On a personal level, Alexis is a mom of three girls and I am a mom of three boys. We expect them to enter a workforce where equality is the norm, not the exception. related A McKinsey leader unites women in tech to prepare for the future of work Four McKinsey leaders share their advice for early-career women"
What does it take to help a new business take off?,These three stories explain how Leap is helping companies create the new digital businesses they need. ,2019-10-25T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Design,Digital,Capability Building",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/what-does-it-take-to-jumpstart-new-businesses,"What does it take to help a new business take off? October 25, 2019 “If you’re not reinventing your business every five years, you risk losing relevance,” says Neal Larkin , a design associate partner in McKinsey. “For businesses to stay competitive today, they’ve got to be thinking that way.” For leaders thinking about building a new digital business, Leap turns ambition into action. “With technology moving so fast, there’s no time for inaction. We’re about doing,” explains Ari Libarikian , a McKinsey senior partner and a global leader for Leap. “Many companies spend a lot of time thinking and talking about their digital future. Leap is all about getting them there quickly by building something new based on the parent company’s strengths.” Leap teams feature a mix of business-building experts, including specialists in analytics, design, and tech. Most of these colleagues have launched their own successful businesses before joining our firm and understand the capabilities a business needs to survive and thrive. “From day one, we build for our work to endure,” explains Ari. “The goal is to build and train a new muscle for our clients, who will then sustain and further strengthen it long after we are gone.” To date, Leap teams have led over 200 business builds, many in less than 12 months. Ralf Dreischmeier , a McKinsey senior partner and a global leader for Leap, explains that Leap’s way of working plays a major role in this success. “We co-locate with our clients and use an agile model to move quickly, while bringing the benefits of a start-up to a corporate environment.” Here are three stories that illustrate some of Leap’s most exciting work. Streaming sports in Asia-Pacific “Think video on demand for sports but cooler,” says Clayton O’Toole , a McKinsey partner in our Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice. That’s how he describes the over the top service he and his team built with a multinational media conglomerate that launched earlier this year in Asia. According to Clayton, only about 25 percent of consumers in a national market were paying for sports content, while over 50 percent considered themselves passionate sports fans. So, Leap worked with our client to seize that opportunity, building an entirely separate streaming business that leverages all of the parent company’s sports rights. The Leap team worked closely with the media company across content selection, pricing and packaging, tech-vendor selection, legal requirements, and talent sourcing. Extensive customer research through deep structured interviews meant the new product’s prototypes and wireframes reflected what customers really wanted. Get to know Leap “The way you engage with sports should be very different from how you watch movies and TV,” explains Eleni Watts , a McKinsey associate who spent 15 months as chief of staff to the company’s CEO. “With sports, you have the ability to deliver unique and interactive features with a greater degree of personalization.” Testing and iterating with customers helped the team fine tune service features like in-game catch-up highlights and a ‘no spoilers’ mode. It’s all added up to a winning game plan. The streaming service is on an exciting growth trajectory so far, having already reached 15 percent of the client’s subscriber base in just six months since launch. Digital banking in North America For a 175-year-old financial institution, becoming the first agile and design-led bank in a regional market meant Leap had the chance to create entirely new customer experiences. Call center frustration gave way to online banking satisfaction, 10-day lending approvals were cut to three minutes, and opening an account became a 30-minute appointment instead of a three-to-five-day ordeal. “We were working in an area where design thinking and agile practices had yet to be used in any industry,” says Neal. “So embedding this way of working was an exciting challenge.” Over the course of 12 weeks, the Leap team partnered with McKinsey’s Digital Academy to build and pilot a capability-learning program that would turn employees into design thinkers to serve customers in new ways through new digital channels. By 24 weeks, the team had shadowed and coached over 200 employees and established 13 agile teams. They also worked closely with HR to create and source talent for new roles like user experience designers, engineers, and data scientists. “We were focused on making design part of the culture,” says Neal. “This means putting the customer at the center of the problem you’re trying to solve, understanding how to do customer research and map out user journeys, and having the technology in place to build minimum viable products .” The digital transformation helped the bank surpass $10 billion in profit. Having now captured a 40 percent market share, the bank is poised to solidify a number one position in the market. Digital lending in Europe For years, the lending market was one of the main sources of revenue for a European bank, but recently that space has become increasingly competitive. So, the bank turned to Leap for help. We built them what McKinsey senior partner Mieke Van Oostende calls a “speed boat,” a digital-lending business for small and medium-sized enterprises. “We had a ton of freedom to move really quickly and test and play in this project,” says Mieke. Ideation sessions helped shape the product, a clickable prototype brought it to life, and customer tests guided development. “We defined a cadence of work built on agile,” adds Fernando Figueiredo , a McKinsey associate partner. “This allowed us to move fast and keep improving the product.” We weren’t working as traditional consultants. Our roles were more like entrepreneurs bringing varied skillsets together. The team worked as one unit in one location over two-week sprints. Daily check-ins ensured close collaboration between disciplines, particularly tech and design. “We weren’t working as traditional consultants,” says Mohcine Ouass , an associate partner. “Our roles were more like entrepreneurs bringing varied skillsets together.” After six months, the digital lending business was live; it had customers and 40 full-time employees. With its 15-minute loan decisions and cash delivery in less than a day, the digital lender has earned the highest net-promoter score in the market after just a year and a half. related Behind the scenes of top digital makeovers Never miss a story"
"Through data, a McKinsey team helps a massive food bank find new ways to feed a city",Our experts have helped the Greater Chicago Food Depository develop a new data-driven system to distribute food equitably across Cook County.,2019-11-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20a%20mckinsey%20teams%20volunteer%20work%20is%20helping%20to%20feed%20the%20city%20of%20chicago/food-bank-hero-sm-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Social Impact,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-a-mckinsey-teams-volunteer-work-is-helping-to-feed-the-city-of-chicago,"Through data, a McKinsey team helps a massive food bank find new ways to feed a city A volunteer cook for the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Photo courtesy of the Greater Chicago Food Depository November 6, 2019 At this moment, all across Chicago’s Cook County, more than 630,000 people don’t know when or where they might get their next meal. Food insecurity, a situation where people don’t have reliable access to adequate amounts of nutritious food, is more prevalent there than many realize. The Greater Chicago Food Depository has been committed to putting an end to that condition for more than 40 years. Serving more than 800,000 people across the second most populous county in the US, the food bank works with over 700 partners, including food pantries, soup kitchens, and shelters that distribute food to underserved areas. But ensuring equitable distribution is tricky; not all communities have equal needs. So the organization asked our firm for help. Led by Roberto Uchoa , a McKinsey senior partner in our Chicago office, a team of McKinsey volunteers began looking at the organization’s strategy. They learned the food bank managed data tracking the 74 million pounds of food it distributed annually, but the group lacked the analytical tools it needed to fully leverage partner organizations’ assets and skills. Back row, from the Greater Chicago Food Depository: Jill Zimmerman, Andy Seikel, Andrew Lutsey, Dennis James. From McKinsey: Nikhilesh Nukala, Raghav Sharma, Rajat Goel, Jason Reynolds Front row, from the Greater Chicago Food Depository: Joan Chow, Sheila Creghin, Nicole Robinson. From McKinsey: Huilin Zeng, Haley Tiu This data, the organization felt, was difficult to manage and incomplete. “Of Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods, we’ve known that 10 to 15 consistently show the highest rates of poverty and unemployment along with the lowest life expectancies,” says Nicole Robinson , vice president of community impact at the Greater Chicago Food Depository. “We’ve always understood that hunger is a symptom of poverty,” Nicole adds. “But we’ve historically not had the depth of insight we needed to inform our strategies so that the most vulnerable communities can become stable through access to nutritious food, employment, and everything in between.” A critical revelation The McKinsey team began by working across the organization to collect and organize the vast amounts of community data the food depository had — but had never used — to build a food equity index. It included metrics like the number of children served, quality of food, and waste produced. “We then used the index to build a tracking dashboard that shows how areas rank in terms of highest and lowest needs and which ones to prioritize,” explains Raghav Sharma , a McKinsey engagement manager. Roberto describes how the index revealed opportunities to improve the equality of food distribution across neighborhoods. It also highlighted areas where the organization had under-realized opportunities to develop distribution partners, like  churches and soup kitchens. “With hard numbers to back it up, we could help them see that food had actually been disproportionately allocated to some neighborhoods whereas other communities required a greater food distribution infrastructure,” explains Roberto. The revelation was critical for the organization. “It was a classic situation of not knowing what we don’t know,” says Andrew Lutsey , vice president of strategic initiatives. “We knew our data systems could be better, but we didn’t know how to make them better or what the best practices were.” But there was more. What the food equity index also revealed is the immense complexity behind food insecurity and the relationship between food and certain social indicators, like education and job opportunities. “The index reinforced for us that the right answer here is not a one-size-fits-all model,” says Sheila Creghin , vice president of operations. “There are nuances to each of the neighborhoods we serve, and demographics play a large role.” More equitable food allocations These insights are also helping the organization make progress in other areas. Public policy and advocacy play critical roles in helping the food depository carry out its mission. “We can now point to a fact-based tool when seeking additional government funding for programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , for example,” says Jill Zimmerman , vice president of development. “We know what programs need greater support, and we can now have clear targets in place to get there.” The McKinsey team is helping them hit those targets. After co-creating a blueprint for new digital tools, which include a food optimization model, the Greater Chicago Food Depository will deploy the approach across its database server to manage the distribution of fresh produce. Based on an algorithm, the model will let the organization know how much food to give each partner location within the community. From there, the organization can coordinate logistics, like sending more vans to an underserved agency to ensure the food it needs arrives fresh. Insight into community partners While the food depository has partnered with its community organizations to distribute food to the people it serves, the group has historically collected very little information from them aside from what their orders are. “We saw this gap as a huge opportunity,” says Raghav. Through data analysis, the McKinsey team designed a customer relationship management system . “Once implemented, this will help us get more information across different systems and create more customized programs based on our partners’ needs,” says Nicole. For example, 70 percent of the organization’s partners are volunteer-based. Knowing where and when there are volunteer shortages will allow them to mobilize more people when needed. “Having this database democratizes all this information about our partners,” says Kate Maehr , executive director and CEO of the Greater Chicago Food Depository. “Entire teams are now empowered to be part of a strategy for improving our communities.” Ultimately, we hope to equip the organization with all the tools it needs to continue delivering on its mission—of moving people out of poverty to lead healthy and productive lives. While the project was officially completed over the summer, in many ways the work still continues. Not long ago, a group of QuantumBlack colleagues held a hackathon in our Chicago office to explore options for other customized solutions. In addition, the McKinsey team hosts monthly tutorials on analytics, supply chain, and project management. “We see our work with the Greater Chicago Food Depository as just the beginning of a long relationship,” says Roberto. “Ultimately, we hope to equip the organization with all the tools it needs to continue delivering on its mission—of moving people out of poverty to lead healthy and productive lives.” related A Japanese partner working to feed the world Never miss a story"

It now employs over 300 people and is operating in 13 countries. November 11, 2019 For many people, a stable job means so much more than just a regular paycheck. For millions of unemployed people all over the world, a job can restore a sense of pride and confidence that comes with the ability to support oneself and loved ones. In 2012, a McKinsey research study looked at a global and seemingly intractable problem: why were so many young people unemployed, even as many businesses struggled to fill job vacancies? That research inspired McKinsey to found Generation , an independent nonprofit organization focused on tackling the most persistent barriers to young people searching for stable employment. This November, Generation is celebrating its fifth birthday. Generation aims to transform how everyone in the education-to-employment equation approaches the goal of employment success, from students to employers to practitioners and policy makers. In just five short years, the organization has grown exponentially. Today, Generation has graduated over 30,000 people from its programs, employs over 300 people, and is operating in 13 countries, ranging from Brazil to India to Australia . The majority of Generation graduates leave the program with job offers in hand. Eighty-one percent are employed at three months post-graduation and at salaries two to six times higher than their previous earnings.  At the one-year mark, close to 70 percent continue to be employed. For example, Generation is training and placing insurance-sales representatives in Kenya , web programmers in Spain , and healthcare assistants in India . And 83 percent of employers say they would hire a Generation graduate again. About McKinsey and Generation Generation is McKinsey’s most ambitious social-responsibility commitment to transform people’s lives and communities through the power of stable, meaningful work. McKinsey not only served as a founding partner; we also worked side by side with the initial Generation team to set up in-country operations and help design programs that bridged the needs of participants and their future employers. Today, we continue to be one of Generation’s more than 70 funders and share our most valuable resource of all—our people. Our leaders make introductions to help Generation find the entry points to successfully launch employment programs.  Our consultants serve in donated fellowships; 300+ McKinsey colleagues have contributed to Generation in a meaningful way over the past five years, with our firm providing ongoing funding and in-kind services. Christian Lilley , a McKinsey expert associate partner, worked with Generation to build its digital team from the ground up. “There were three people on the team when I came on board to help, and the organization had enormous digital needs, like building recruiting platforms that had to function in multiple languages,” he said in a recent interview. “I saw the digital team grow to over twenty people, and I was able to facilitate that type of growth because of what I had already done at McKinsey.” Gabriela Paranhos , an engagement manager, helped the Generation team launch in Brazil. “I care very deeply about the problem of unemployment here,” says Gabriela. “During the start-up phase of the program, we worked diligently to find out which employers had actual vacancies and how to design a program that would work for the businesses and the learners in the program.” “My favorite memory,” Gabriela adds, “is when I met one of the graduates at his first job fair. He was excited at all of the interest he was getting from employers, and he just threw his arms around me and gave me a big hug.” Generation is growing existing programs, moving into new regions, and expanding its learner population to include people in need of job reskilling for industries new to them. The new initiative for mid-career learners is called ReGeneration, with pilot programs running in the Singapore, Spain, and the United States.

Located in the Mall of America, the space opened on September 27th. November 12, 2019 Are our days of in-store shopping numbered? The rapid rise of e-commerce, which has accounted for over 40 percent of US retail sales growth since 2016 , might suggest that they could be. But not everyone is so sure. “Stores are not going away,” says McKinsey partner Praveen Adhi . “But they have to evolve. There is a tremendous opportunity at the intersection of technology and analytics to transform the in-store experience for the customer, while making a step change improvement in profitability.” Our firm is showing retailers what the future of stores might look like. As has been widely reported in the media, McKinsey’s Retail Practice has created a fully interconnected shopping experience called the Modern Retail Collective . Located in Mall of America, which welcomes 40 million shoppers annually, the space opened on September 27th. The Collective, as it’s also known, is a collaborative venture between McKinsey, Mall of America, retail brands, and technology providers like Microsoft , Zebra , Square , FaceCake , and Smartrac . It’s a real, shoppable, multi-brand store where retailers can test the latest technologies with actual customers. Despite the rise in online shopping, our research shows that most consumers still want a brick-and-mortar experience. “And direct-to consumer-brands are increasingly choosing to create physical environments to drive awareness and sales,” explains Tiffany Burns , a McKinsey partner. An example of this is intimates brand ThirdLove located at The Collective, which marks its second physical location so far. “Clients often tell us they want to experiment with new types of in-store technologies,” says Jennifer Schmidt , a McKinsey senior partner. “But they’re inundated with the magnitude of new technology available and are often unsure how, how much, and where to invest.” The Modern Retail Collective is a safe space for brick-and-mortar businesses to test and learn. “The beauty of the Collective is that it offers retailers the ability to experiment with little risk or disruption to their own stores and operations,” adds Tiffany. “It’s a flexible environment, where they can work with new technology and learn what resonates with customers.” To understand how digital tools affect store traffic, engagement, transactions, and productivity,  for example, the Collective helps retailers make sense of non-sensitive customer and operational data. “We’re prioritizing topics that retailers say are most top of mind for them,” says Jennifer. “Right now, the Collective is looking at product discovery: how can technology help in-store shoppers discover new products and get the same level of information that they would have online?” One way is through interactive mobile hot spots. Through near-field communication technology, customers simply wave their phones over hot spots near a product they’re interested in, and more product information and reviews appear on their screens. No app download is required. “Nothing takes the place of physically touching and walking out with a product, though,” says Gerry Hough , a McKinsey senior expert. “And that’s why we made a very purposeful decision to offer a mix of physically purchasable products along with additional digital options.” The jewelry brand Kendra Scott , for example, offers top seller items for onsite purchase, as well as an endless aisle of custom designs that rely heavily on shoppers’ interaction with actual stones, metals, and styles. So, McKinsey, Kendra Scott, and ComQi created digital displays that use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to register a customer’s choice of stone and design in the store itself. Purchases, then, are shipped directly to their home. Elsewhere in the Collective, augmented-reality mirrors allow customers to interact with and virtually try-on merchandise. “For retailers, this means not needing to carry as much inventory in the store, since shoppers can explore it all through this platform,” explains Tyler Harris , a McKinsey engagement manager. With an integrated social sharing component, customers can take selfies, share looks with friends, and make purchases of their favorite items. From anywhere within the Collective, customers are able to check out quickly through a portable point-of-sale device. There’s also a counter dedicated to Flexa , a platform for cryptocurrency payments, that helps educate shoppers on multi-currency wallets and offers retailers the opportunity to explore the future of lower cost and fraud-free payments. “The idea is to offer shoppers a new, frictionless way to interact with and pay for merchandise that cuts across both online and offline channels,” says Gerry, “and to validate the operational efficiencies that crypto-enabled payments can offer retailers in the future.” Every four months, a new set of brands will be featured in the Collective with a new use case to test. Examples could include looking at the impact of in-store technology on conversion, sales-associate productivity, inventory automation, post-purchase engagement, and more. By analyzing data from in-store technologies, the team can stitch together and understand customer journeys to unlock unprecedented insights for improving engagement and operational efficiency. “Imagine being able to quantify what levers to pull,” says Tyler. “With that kind of fact-base, the rewards for those that get this right will be significant.” Our research shows that effective personalization can increase store revenues by up to 30 percent , and several next-gen technologies can improve store productivity by at least 10 to 20 percent.  “This has significant implications for stores’ profits and losses as well as the level of customer service associates will be able to offer customers,” adds Jennifer. “Now is a great time for retailers to embrace this challenge of integrating tactile experiences and operational processes with the seamlessness of digital,” adds Tiffany. “And we’re really excited to show all that’s possible here in the store.” Never miss a story"

November 26, 2019 It’s been said that “the best way to predict the future is to create it.” As global forces like the rise of emerging economies and rapid digitization change how we live and work, creating a future where everyone can thrive requires radical new ways of looking at the world. “This kind of thinking is centered around humans. It works to deeply understand our needs and motivations, and then creates solutions that improve lives,” says Hugo Sarrazin, a McKinsey senior partner and global leader of our Design Practice .  “That is what design is all about.” More than 100 chief design officers and senior design leaders from a range of industries around the world gathered last month in Stockholm’s Nobel Prize hall for McKinsey’s inaugural Global Design Leader Summit. The meeting was the first gathering of a new community of top design talent, who shared how their craft might help tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing their organizations, their communities, and in turn society at large. Here they celebrated the history and impact of design, tied to the 50th anniversary of Veryday, now part of McKinsey Design , and discussed where they see the future of design and its leadership. “It’s no longer about making things pretty,” said Logitech president and CEO, Bracken Darrell . “That was the first wave of design. Then came the second where design focused on experiences and human needs. Building on these is the third wave, where we’re designing for everything—every single problem you look at.” According to Tera Allas , McKinsey’s director of research and economics, design plays a critical and perhaps surprising role in shaping today’s global forces, like poverty and climate change. “When it comes to the adoption of tech for good, it has to come from a user perspective,” she says. “That kind of human centricity is something so ingrained in designers.” Some examples include buildings’ uses of IoT-enabled predictive systems that have lowered electricity consumption and costs by 30 percent, or remote health monitoring through wearables that has led to a 40 percent reduction in hospital readmission rates. Attendees agreed that while design is well-suited to address social and environmental issues, few understand the scope of what might be considered design. “Objects, artifacts, services, of course,” says Jennifer Kilian , a McKinsey partner and leader in our Digital and Design Practices, “but it’s also redesigning how companies, governments, and public sector organizations work.” Take, for example, the power and importance of trust for institutions, such as government. People are nine times more likely to trust an agency if they’ve had positive experiences with their services. How easy are they to access, how smooth is the process? These are design questions. Such questions arose as attendees broke out into groups to develop prototypes for each of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals . Some of the ideas that emerged during this session included creating a generosity index for organizations and helping companies see the benefit of disrupting their own businesses. “Business values and societal and environmental values are inseparable,” said Andrew Morlet , CEO of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation . And when it comes to measuring the value of design , our research shows the positive effects it has on financial, societal, and environmental performance. But in order for such value to be realized, design needs to be fully embedded throughout every part of an organization. While our research shows that design is more than a department , many attendees shared the struggles they face in feeling siloed within their own companies. Many in the room agreed that it can be lonely being the chief design officer inside a company. Unlike designers in an agency, in-house design leaders may find themselves without peers and constantly trying to motivate and protect their teams. Without a C-suite that has bought into the value of design, the day-to-day can be challenging. Designers are bridge builders, and so too was this summit: a place to build bridges. Hugo emphasized the importance of building partnerships both within and between organizations and institutions. Open communication and shared experiences can help dismantle preconceptions and foster a common language and understanding of design’s value among all executives. “Designers are bridge builders,” adds Hugo “and so too was this summit: a place to build bridges.” Through this community, new bonds could firm that cross industries, where lessons from great successes and failures and insights into radical transformations can be translated and built on. “Hopefully we will see more of these types of connections to really create a better future for all.” Never miss a story"
The top healthcare trends we spotted at the 2019 HLTH conference,"The latest innovations in healthcare, including new tech, business models, and mind-sets, were showcased at the recent blockbuster HLTH conference. Here&rsquo;s what our colleagues said, saw, and heard.",2019-11-27T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/top%20innovation%20trends%20in%20healthcare/hc-inline-pooja-1536x864.jpg,"Healthcare,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/top-innovation-trends-in-healthcare,"The top healthcare trends we spotted at the 2019 HLTH conference Pooja Kumar, MD, a McKinsey partner, outlines the changing role of women in healthcare at the 2019 HLTH conference. November 27, 2019 Investment in healthcare technology is growing at a feverish rate: $4.2 billion was invested in digital health in the first half of 2019, and consumers can now choose from no fewer than 300,000 mobile healthcare applications . How can an organization navigate such a complex, volatile landscape? Which technologies—electroceuticals, genomics, and AI, to name a few—will move the needle on improving care? How, when, and where to start? These questions and others dominated the second HLTH conference in Las Vegas last month, where our firm served as a knowledge partner. In just two years HLTH attendance has surged to around 6,000 people, attesting to the urgency of these challenges. And while the conference was held in a city known as a place for taking chances, the discussions there were all about reducing risk—of investing in new models, capabilities, and ecosystems. Speakers this year included leaders such as the late Bernard J. Tyson , former chairman and CEO of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan; Larry Merlo , president and CEO of CVS Health; and Anne Wojcicki , cofounder and CEO of 23andMe. In addition, more than 20 colleagues from our Healthcare Systems & Services Practice attended the event. Here’s a snapshot of what they saw and heard. From ‘ patient’ to ‘ digital consumer’ McKinsey partner Jack Topdjian sat down with Facebook’s Freddy Abnousi, MD; Twitter’s Lisa Bookwalter; and Tencent’s Meng Zhang for a panel discussion on the role of social-media platforms in healthcare. With new applications, increased information, and the ability to make social, clinical, and behavioral connections, social media is consumerizing the health experience. It’s also helping users and their doctors better manage social determinants : factors such as diet and support systems that can influence up to 40 percent of a patient’s health outcome. But panelists also discussed the rise of misinformation on their platforms. For example, the Chinese tech giant Tencent has around 100,000 new health-related articles circulating each day. Winning users’ trust by helping them evaluate and navigate that landscape represents an enormous opportunity. Swimming with the ‘sharks’ The HLTH agenda this year also included a dose of reality TV:  specifically, Shark Tank .  Fifteen applicants competed in a session called the Start-Up Pitch for prizes including a workshop with McKinsey featuring experts from Fuel , a McKinsey company dedicated to serving global start-ups and their investors. The contestants had three minutes to pitch their products and three minutes to field sharp questions from a panel of judges from venture-capital companies. Ideas included an application using genomics data to determine diets, a 30-second breath test that monitored more than ten health markers, and an AI algorithm that could identify the most viable embryos for in vitro fertilization. While all of the ideas were ambitious and far reaching, the inspiration for many came from close to home: a mom with chronic heart condition, a younger brother with autism, and an infant son who was hospitalized. The winners? The audience chose Particle Health , a “Venmo-like transfer service for medical records.” The judges’ favorite was Manatee, a mobile app that allows children with autism and developmental disabilities to receive cognitive-behavioral therapy at home. The focus of the session then moved behind the scenes for a look at how start-ups actually function, with new research presented by Judy Wade , a leader at Fuel. “Start-ups tend to be tightly cohesive and physically located together. They align quickly, take risks, and often have a charismatic leader,” explained Judy. “But they also can have biases that influence decisions, such as ‘anchoring bias,’ which means relying too heavily on the first piece of information and ‘confirmation bias,’ the belief that past success guarantees future success.” “Trying to dull the edges of the culture isn’t the right answer—it’s why a start-up can be successful,” Julie added. “But they need to find a way through training and forums to recognize their biases so they can pause and make better decisions about who to hire, how to invest, and [how to] manage the day to day. The result will be a more diverse, balanced, and, ultimately, successful organization.” Reinventing Medicaid Healthcare programs serving low-income, vulnerable populations, such as Medicaid , are perhaps among those most in need of innovation today. Ellen Feehan , Jessica Kahn , Katherine Linzer , and Meera Mani , all partners at McKinsey, organized a workshop featuring leaders of state Medicaid programs, who shared their experiences in implementing digital tools, advanced analytics, AI, and agile methodologies to better serve their populations. The leaders from Michigan made one of the session’s biggest impressions. With a flourish, the speakers unfurled a 30-foot-long sheet of paper, which rolled out to the back of the room. It was a printout of the state’s previous Medicaid application form: 42 pages, 18,000 words, and a 50 percent denial rate. Step by step, the speakers from Michigan took the audience through their years-long effort to reinvent the application process in their state into a mobile-first, online experience that was 67 percent faster, with 75 percent fewer errors. “I’m so jealous,” called out one of the audience members. Four other success stories followed, each featuring a different tech approach, all designed hand in hand with their clients to create the changes people want. Evolving to ecosystems The next horizon of healthcare will be the maturing of ecosystems—networks of collaborators working across payers, providers, pharma, med tech, digital start-ups, big tech, and government. They will help deliver an exceptional patient experience, democratize access to physical and virtual care, and deliver new models and technologies. But how does an organization find—or build—an ecosystem that fits its goals? Jack Topdjian, along with Brandon Carrus , Erica Coe , Pooja Kumar , Prashanth Reddy , and Sri Velamoor, all partners at McKinsey, organized a series of workshops in which leaders were challenged to radically reimagine the journeys of a variety of patients, from a 22-year-old man with type 1 diabetes to an elderly woman with two or more chronic conditions. Now it’s time to lead our [industry]—to the benefit of our society’s most vulnerable members. They designed an ecosystem that encompassed all of the components of health and advanced technologies, including nutrition, mental health, and support networks, to help them manage their conditions and enhance their wellness. Other topics included improving productivity and eliminating waste. “The overall mood was pensive, as many have work to do,” said Jack. “But the silver lining is that other industries have done this type of evolution. Now it’s time to lead ours—to the benefit of our society’s most vulnerable members.” related Boosting the systems that fight cancer: Meet our oncology experts Doctors at McKinsey Never miss a story"

December 6, 2019 More than 1,000 CEOs and senior executives gathered in London this November for our first flagship conference on the digital revolution, called BLINK . Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt delivered the event’s opening keynote before joining McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader for a conversation on leadership in a disruptive world. The conference takes its name from the split-second nature of the world in which we live, where business and technology advances upend the status quo, creating opportunities and challenges, seemingly in the blink of an eye. Blink: your house is talking to you. Blink: your competitor is your partner. Blink: your market has moved halfway around the planet. The event took place at the Olympia Grand , which has a storied 130-year history of hosting exhibits, horse shows, rock concerts, and political rallies. But for this one day, BLINK offered a glimpse of the future. The agenda included a mix of informal conversations, panel discussions, networking sessions, and “tech zones,” areas where the latest digital tools and equipment were on full display. Experts shared insights from their companies’ own digital transformations and discussed the growing pains they experienced when changing from a “start-up” to a “grown-up” organization. And while some sessions addressed how businesses could catch up to new tech, others flipped the paradigm, exploring ways in which new tech could open doors for organizations to think and operate differently. On the exhibit floor, for instance, attendees had the chance to redesign a lemonade factory to learn how adding the right technology can juice productivity. Elsewhere, they could try a virtual-reality simulator to understand how designers used the technology to develop a surgical robot, and then trained surgeons to work with it. And for those who wanted to see how the slightest adjustment can deliver an outsize competitive edge, our QuantumBlack team demonstrated how it applied advanced analytics to help race-car drivers make strategic decisions on the course. Woven through all the tech talk was a human thread: how to inspire trust in your online users; how to hire the right people to guide your company through convulsive changes; how to learn what your customers truly value in your products and services; how to tell inspiring stories. “When I think about solving the problems ahead of us, the answer is people,” Eric Schmidt said, explaining that businesses, governments, and society at large would do well to invest in remarkable people first and existing technologies second, a point our firm’s research supports. “The notion that the firm with the most data wins is temporal,” he said. “We’ll soon find that the firms with the smartest engineers—not the most data—will be the ones who win.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Three startups win McKinsey support in their quest to become impact unicorns,Our partnership with the Swedish foundation Norrsken is helping startups that want to improve lives at scale.,2019-12-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20a%20mckinsey%20team%20is%20fueling%20the%20next%20impact%20unicorns/norrsken-inline-winners-1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-a-mckinsey-team-is-fueling-the-next-impact-unicorns,"Three startups win McKinsey support in their quest to become impact unicorns Representatives of the three startups that took away 2019 Norrsken Awards: Re:newcell, Ignitia, and N2 Applied. December 19, 2019 Unicorns, once confined to myths and fairy tales, are now common fixtures in business conversations. And lately, a new breed is beginning to emerge wherever purpose-driven people and effective organizations thrive. “Impact unicorns” are startups that promise to improve one billion lives, and they’re what a Swedish non-profit organization called Norrsken is hoping to raise as it encourages entrepreneurs to tackle some of society’s biggest challenges. This effort culminated in Norrsken’s inaugural Impact Week, an event celebrating impact entrepreneurship that was held in Stockholm earlier this quarter. Bringing together hundreds of startups with venture capital (VC) investors, the event gave innovators the chance to network with unicorn founders and explore how tech and entrepreneurship can combine to solve global issues like famine, food waste, poverty, and discrimination. The week also included the launch of the Norrsken Award —the biggest Nordic prize for impact startups. “The level of excitement from students, investors, and developers was overwhelming,” says Niklas Adalberth , Norrsken founder and Klarna co-founder. “We’re clearly reaching a tipping point where we’re seeing a competitive advantage for purpose-led companies that are net positive for the planet.” The goal is to create a social movement, where impact founders and entrepreneurs are supported in the same way that commercial entrepreneurs are. McKinsey has partnered with Norrsken, offering support on a pro bono basis, since its founding in 2016. In that time, we’ve helped structure its VC fund and expand its ecosystem of investment capital to other markets. Today, Norrsken is one of the biggest impact-tech funds in Europe, having invested in 17 impact startups to date. The organization has also opened two coworking locations in Stockholm and Kigali, Rwanda. Over the last six months, a team from McKinsey’s Stockholm office that included colleagues from Fuel , a McKinsey company that works with startups, partnered with Norrsken to promote social entrepreneurship in the Nordics. “The goal,” explains McKinsey partner and European leader of Fuel Tobias Stralin , “is to create a social movement where impact founders and entrepreneurs are supported in the same way that commercial entrepreneurs are.” Louise Nehler , a former McKinsey associate in Stockholm, worked with Norrsken to design Impact Week and launch the Norrsken Award. The three winners each receive half a year of pro bono part-time support from McKinsey to help them grow quickly and reach new markets, in addition to communications and marketing advice from Brunswick Group and legal support from Mannheimer Swartling . Among the finalists this year were startups that offered personalized learning in school, solar cells that work indoors, and cancer detection with your phone. McKinsey senior partner and Fuel leader Chandra Gnanasambandam was a Norrsken Award judge. “We looked at factors like how many people can be helped, the strength of the business idea, and the diversity of the teams,” says Chandra.“We wanted ideas solving for highly relevant problems on a mass scale that have already demonstrated market viability with existing customers.” Three winners met that high bar: textile recycler Re:newcell , tropical-weather forecaster Ignitia , and a company that aims to help farmers produce their own fertilizer from renewable resources, N2 Applied . In these startups, Chandra sees evidence of a wider trend. “In many ways Norrsken is a microcosm of a broader movement we see happening all over the world,” he says. In just the last 18 months, he explains, more businesses are thinking beyond shareholder value creation toward breakthrough ideas with societal benefits. Tobias agrees. “We know more than ever that doing good for the environment means doing good for business ,” he says. “And businesses are great vehicles to changing society.” Learn more about the winners below. Re:newcell To counter the 90 million tons of fashion materials that end up in landfills and incinerators each year, Re:newcell ’s Professor Gunnar Henrikkson, Dr. Christoffer Lindgren, Mr. Johan Sundblad , and Professor Mikael Lindstrom worked with Malcolm Norlin to develop a chemical process that transforms cotton textiles into sheets of cellulose pulp for textile fiber producers to use. Ignitia In tropical areas where 80 percent of the economy depends on agriculture, changing weather patterns can have an immediate impact on livelihoods. To help solve for this, Liisa Smits and a team of scientists developed Ignitia : a highly accurate tropical weather forecasting tool that sends farmers location-based text messages with daily, monthly, and seasonal weather forecasts. N2 Applied N2 Applied ’s technology enables livestock farmers to produce cost competitive, high quality nitrogen fertilizer from manure, air, and renewable energy, directly on the farm.

He has been with our firm for over 20 years, having joined the Washington, DC, office in 1997. A native of Yemen, Gassan returned to the region in 2000 as a founding member of McKinsey’s Middle East office. Today, he works with clients across the public, private, and social sectors, accelerating economic and social transformation and developing next-generation talent. As McKinsey enters its 20th year in the Middle East, we sat down with Gassan to learn more about who he is, hear his perspectives on the region, and find out why he is passionate about helping young people there succeed. Meet Gassan Al-Kibsi Gassan was born in Yemen and spent his early childhood there. His father was then appointed to the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, DC, which gave him access to a new world of educational and professional opportunities. In this segment, Gassan remembers his friends and classmates in Yemen who didn’t have those opportunities, and talks about how this inequity has instilled his deep sense of purpose and personal commitment to creating opportunities for youth in the region. Why this region matters The Middle East region is home to one of the youngest populations in the world, with nearly 65 percent of its people under the age of 30. “The fate of this region’s youth matters to the world,” Gassan explains. Here, he breaks down the Middle East’s population trends and paints a vivid picture that illustrates why the region and its youth have such major implications for the future stability of the global economy. The momentum and opportunity While the region has its challenges, there is optimism about the economic transformation underway. “ We ’ re seeing real changes in action, but we ’ re also seeing changes in mindset,” says Gassan. “ There’s now generally a much bigger openness to the rest of the world, that just didn’t exist before.” This segment highlights some of the biggest shifts that are driving this momentum and the opportunities to participate in this transformation. What is our role in all of this? Gassan reinforces McKinsey’s commitment to help deliver an economic transformation of unprecedented pace and scale, the success of which matters not only to the region but also to the world. “Our purpose,” he says, “is to strengthen the institutional muscle to make things happen and deliver.” related Meet Pal Erik Sjatil, regional managing partner for Europe Never miss a story"
"In India, McKinsey teams up with Pratham to help millions of children learn to read and write",Our partnership with the country&rsquo;s largest youth-literacy and vocational-skills organization is helping build a brighter future for children across the country.,2020-01-17T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/giving%20back%20for%20literacy%20in%20india/pratham-hero-wide-1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Education",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/giving-back-for-literacy-in-india,"In India, McKinsey teams up with Pratham to help millions of children learn to read and write January 17, 2020 India has made significant progress improving educational opportunities for all children, but substantial gaps in literacy remain. In India alone, 266 million people cannot read or write, which represents 35 percent of the world’s adult population. Without basic reading and writing skills, many education and employment doors remain closed for India’s young people. Pratham, the largest non-governmental organization in India offering literacy and vocational skills support for children, is dedicated to opening those doors. After conducting a strategic review for the organization in 2004, McKinsey once again partnered with Pratham in 2018 to develop a five-year strategic plan to maximize the organization’s impact and resources. Led by McKinsey senior partner Ramesh Mangaleswaran, our firm helped Pratham assess its core organizational strengths to prioritize two of its most effective strategies: government partnerships for literacy services and a village-based approach to literacy and education. In working with Pratham, the McKinsey project team adopted what they call a “micro to macro” approach: Pratham is a well-known, award-winning organization with a national network that reaches 58 million young people with literacy and vocational services in 23 Indian states and numerous partnerships and contacts. With such an extensive reach and so many different initiatives, the charge for the strategic planning process was to take a step back and assess the organization’s impact over the last 15 years and understand whether success could be achieved in more efficient ways. “This was a 25-year-old organization, one of the most successful of its kind,” says Ketav Mehta , a McKinsey engagement manager based in Chennai who helped lead the project. “Our job was to help them focus on very specific strategic questions, because even though school enrollment in India was very high, there were still big gaps in literacy rates. I believe that we were able to help them move forward on the specific initiatives that would really help children learn to read and write.” I believe that we were able to help them move forward on the specific initiatives that would really help children learn to read and write. As a result of the strategic planning work, Pratham chose to focus on two approaches in particular. The first, strengthening government partnerships, has already resulted in a double-digit improvement rates among 3.6 million children in the state of Uttar Pradesh. By 2022, the program is expected to reach an additional nine million children. The second focus involves an “end to end,” village-based approach, where educational services previously scattered across multiple locations are now focused on entire villages, helping children from grades one through ten.

These titles from our Organization Practice colleagues will help. They offer masterclasses in how to develop, shape, and improve leadership within organizations of thousands or teams of one. Catch a glimpse of each in the interviews below. Leadership at Scale: Better Leadership, Better Results By McKinsey’s Leadership Development Practice co-founder Claudio Feser; former McKinsey Organization Practice global leader Michael Rennie; and McKinsey Associate Partner Nicolai Chen Nielsen, with whom we spoke . Why another book on leadership? There are so many different definitions of what leadership even is. Is it a mindset? Is it about outcomes? It may be a bit of both. In our book, we’ve defined leadership as a discrete set of observable behaviors that are highly context-dependent. What works in one organization can be very wrong for another. We also believe the current understanding around leadership is limiting. People often believe that leadership qualities are innate, that they can’t be taught. If that were true, there would be a finite number of leaders. We don’t believe that’s the case. Furthermore, we believe it’s harmful for organizations to limit their own pool of potential leaders. We believe that organizations can and should build a sizeable cadre of leaders. In our book, we show that organizations that build a critical mass of leaders tend to outperform those that focus on the very few. We’re dedicated to developing a large number of leaders for every organization. How many good leaders does an organization need? Depending on the organization, it could be up to thousands of people. Leadership at scale is about more than the CEO. It’s about the team leaders, department chiefs, and division heads all becoming better, more effective leaders. When that happens, it’s reflected in the effectiveness of the organization as a whole. An organization is merely the sum of behaviors of the people within it. What we find is that you need to engage a critical mass of what we call “pivotal influencers,” people within the organization who are respected by their colleagues, regardless of their title. In practice, we find that if around five to 15 percent of the pivotal influencers can change the way they lead, that’s enough to affect the broader organization. On top of that, the thousands upon thousands of people who aren’t in formal leadership programs should still have a shared understanding of what great leadership looks like. Ask ten people for their definition of leadership and they’ll give you ten different answers. An organization can’t build toward anything without that shared understanding. With leadership, we can break it down to a set of behaviors, which are easier and more practical to define than any sort of intrinsic characteristics. This makes it easier for people to understand and aspire to, no matter their position in an organization. Why should readers invest their time in this book? CEOs ask us something similar all the time: can they really afford to invest their time and resources into a program to get to leadership at scale? What we know is that for organizations going through a transformation program, investing in leadership development will make them more than two times likelier to succeed than if they don’t. To your question, how you invest your time is critical. I would encourage people to view the choice to read our book not as a “this or that” but as a “this and that,” creating the space in their day to enjoy the latest bestseller AND hone their leadership chops. Beyond Performance 2.0: A Proven Approach to Leading Large-Scale Change By McKinsey Senior Partners Scott Keller and Bill Schaninger, global leaders in the Strategy and Corporate Finance and Organization Practices, respectively . What will readers find in “Beyond Performance 2.0” that they didn’t in the first edition of the book? The first edition emphasized what a healthy organization looks like and then described the change management process necessary to get there. The emphasis of “Beyond Performance 2.0” is on the change management process itself. We’ve also built in all of our learnings over the past decade, during which our research base has significantly expanded. It now includes over five million inputs from over 2000 companies around the world. Finally, we’ve reformatted the book to be a practical step-by-step guide for change leaders who are serious about beating the odds of success. And those odds aren’t great: something like 70 percent of companies that attempt a transformation of some kind end up failing at it. What makes an organization healthy? A healthy organization works together effectively in pursuit of a common goal. Healthier companies perform better, to the tune of three times higher total returns to shareholders and two-and-a-half times more returns on invested capital. We measure health in relation to nine outcomes, including things like direction, accountability, and motivation along with the 37 management practices that drive those outcomes, which include strategic clarity, role clarity, consequence management, and so on. Why is change management so hard? Organizations don’t change, people do. So, to the extent that you can help people change, you can also help organizations change. But that’s not easy to do. There’s good news for leaders, however. Over the past few decades, psychology has shown us all how social, cognitive, and emotional biases systematically keep us from making good decisions, even though our rational mind tells us they shouldn’t. Leaders who understand this can turn roadblocks into powerful change accelerants. The field of economics has been transformed by such learnings with the advent of behavioral economics. Yet the field of change management hasn’t yet fully embraced them. That’s something we hope to change. Some people likely won’t want to change. What should leaders do then? The first step is to uncover the root cause of such resistance, which is typically related to skill sets—asking people to do what they don’t know how to do—or mindsets, people believing that something about the change program isn’t possible. From there, we again draw from research in cognitive and social psychology, which shows that there are four main levers that leaders can use to overcome resistance. The first is creating understanding and conviction, to get “I know what is expected of me, I agree with it, and I want to do it” from everyone in your organization. The second is providing reinforcement from formal mechanisms, in which the organization’s formal mechanisms reinforce the shifts in mindsets and behaviors that workers are being asked to make. The third is increasing confidence and skills, getting people to a place where they can think, “I have the skills and safe places necessary to practice thinking and behaving in the new way.” Finally, there’s role modeling, where people see their leaders and respected colleagues, and take their cues about thinking and behaving in the new way from them. As you can see, a winning strategy depends on our understanding of people: what motivates us, what we desire, what we believe. What is Water? How Young Leaders Can Thrive in an Uncertain World By McKinsey Organization Practice Consultant Kayvan Kian . What’s the central argument of “What is Water?” In an increasingly complex world, a thriving life depends on recognizing what you can control and what you can’t. You talk a lot about the context for young people coming into leadership roles today. Many young people feel overwhelmed by the complex and rapidly changing world they have inherited. I’ve heard an acronym to describe it: VUCA – volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Focusing on the things people can’t control can wear them down. I’ve seen that happen firsthand. So I created a program called the Young Leaders Forum (YLF), a McKinsey Academy program for client leaders in their 20s and 30s, to show people how to identify the factors they actually can control. Tell us about the program. What are you seeing? And what kind of impact is it having? I started the YLF to help people understand the benefits of refocusing on the things that they can control on the job and in life generally. This skill frees up emotional energy and time to focus on the projects that mean the most to them. So far, we’ve hosted over 50 forum events worldwide, with more than 2,000 participants. The response to our events has been overwhelmingly positive, and I’ve always wanted to make this knowledge accessible to those who can’t attend YLF. That played a major role in my decision to write this book. Do you think young leaders today are different from previous generations or is it, again, more about the context they face? I wouldn’t say that people have changed. There are many things that remain constant among every generation: a desire for meaning and to use their strengths, for instance. When editing the book, I got a lot of input from senior leaders, even retired leaders, saying, “Oh I wish I could have read this earlier in my career.” They had weathered their respective storms, but even looking back now they can see how they would have benefited from understanding how to focus on the things that matter. In that sense, the things I discuss in the book are universal across generations. However, I’d say that even since I joined McKinsey in 2007, the environment that these young leaders face – the complex, fast-changing world – has made the concepts in the book more of a necessity rather than a luxury. Finally, what’s the story behind the title of your book? It was inspired by David Foster Wallace's commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005. It's about the importance of being aware of your context – and how hard that actually is. In the speech, he shares an anecdote where an older fish asks two younger fish, “Morning! How’s the water?” One of the younger fish asks the other, “What is water?” I think it fits. Never miss a story"
Davos 2020: What mattered,McKinsey&rsquo;s global managing partner Kevin Sneader shares his notes from this year&rsquo;s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting.,2020-01-27T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/davos%202019%20four%20big%20themes/seader-davos-2020.jpg,"Davos,Kevin Sneader,Europe",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/davos-2020-four-big-themes,"Davos 2020: What mattered McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader during the 2020 WEF Annual Meeting panel: Leading a 21st Century Corporation, held January 22, 2020. Photo credit: World Economic Forum / Boris Baldinger. January 27, 2020 Unseasonably and somewhat unnervingly mild temperatures provided a fitting backdrop for what emerged as the top issue at the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting : climate change and its risks. But that was far from the only topic. At the end of this year’s Annual Meeting, I sat down with Rik Kirkland, our director of publishing, to share my reflections. Here are four key takeaways, which are also captured in this video. Climate risk is firmly established as a C-suite issue. Research published in reports like the McKinsey Global Institute’s “ Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts ” has clearly convinced more and more global policy makers and business leaders that the problem of climate change has moved from a far-off priority to a here-and-now risk that demands action. Personal experiences, whether from watching the wildfires in Australia or California or numerous other small examples, have also brought home the reality that this is a topic that requires leadership from the top. While there wasn’t much debate about the science, executives and investors were concerned about the lack of reliable data on the efforts companies and society are making, not to mention their impact. Greater clarity is required in order to speed development of new standards to help markets act more efficiently and reward progress. Beyond metrics, the leaders I spoke with are thinking about the problem in new and creative ways. They are taking a clear-eyed look at what is driving their carbon footprints, beginning to quantify the cost of inaction, and asking how they can accelerate positive change in a way that fits within their core business agenda. That’s a huge shift in tone from even a year ago. The short-term economic outlook is “optimistic.” First, a caveat: the Davos consensus is not always right. Last year, many feared 2018’s synchronous growth would turn into synchronous recession. That did not prove to be the case. In fact, by a number of measures, economic growth in many countries in 2019 turned out just fine and markets hit all-time highs. For 2020, most people I met felt that the major economies are in solid shape and should have a perfectly good year. True, one renowned investor did tell me that he was heading home to “short the market in the face of so much positivity.” But I hope, and believe, he will be proved wrong. One cause for optimism: In contrast to last year’s broad macro-anxiety, corporate executives seemed more set than ever on leveraging technology and organizational transformation to boost productivity and capture new pockets of growth. That renewed focus should help counter worries over geopolitical risk—trade tensions and the potential for further fracturing of the global economy into a “G-2” world. People love AI. People fear AI. While climate bumped technology from last year’s number-one slot as the Big Topic, tech and AI in particular again featured prominently. On the positive side, we heard much excitement about how applying AI can drive good outcomes in health care (particularly around cancer research), enable smarter energy consumption, and make factories and workplaces far more productive. Our own research suggests companies that apply AI and analytics at scale are three times more likely to see outsized gains in revenue growth and cost savings than peers who linger in “pilot purgatory.” (This puts to rest the old joke retold by one executive who lamented that he had “more pilots than an airline.”) Combined with smart moves on the people side—reorganizing work processes and reskilling at scale—this leaves employees more satisfied and engaged . But there were also long conversations about how AI can be misused and what it will take to mitigate that risk. Take the connected home. Despite its huge potential, citizens will be decidedly less positive about allowing the technology into their personal spaces unless companies are better able to answer when they ask: “What does this mean for my privacy?” The stakeholder era is here. The Annual Meeting’s overarching theme this year was “stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world.” A number of sessions covered the breakdown in trust, probed globalization’s shortcomings, and underscored the need for companies to think not only about investors but also the planet, employees, and the communities in which they operate. As with climate, the business case for progress—for continuing to build diverse and equitable workplaces, for growing more sustainably with greater inclusion—has been made. The challenge is not why but how. Our firm, like so many others, is still searching for answers. What we have identified, however, is a set of questions that can help guide these discussions and ensure the right debate takes place over the inevitable trade-offs they will require. These include : What is our purpose and mission? Who are our stakeholders and who really benefits from our success? How are we accountable to them, over what time frame? Each company’s choices will vary, depending on its specific strengths and weaknesses, its competitive context. What’s not in doubt, I believe, is that getting this right, for us and for so many others, will be the defining trait of 21st century corporate leadership. related Reflections from Davos 2018 Dispatches from Davos Never miss a story"

"Meet CausalNex, our new open-source library for causal reasoning and “what if” analysis",Our newest software product helps data scientists build models that consider cause-and-effect relationships.,2020-02-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/causalnex%20our%20new%20open%20source%20software%20library/causal-nex-hero-sm-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/causalnex-our-new-open-source-library-leverages-cause-and-effect-relationships-in-data,"Meet CausalNex, our new open-source library for causal reasoning and “what if” analysis CausalNex allows data scientists to collaborate with business teams early on in projects. February 7, 2020 QuantumBlack, our advanced analytics firm, recently announced the launch of its latest open source product, CausalNex. It ’ s a software library that data scientists can use to analyze datasets and build models that consider cause-and-effect, a challenge that experts have long struggled to solve. “A lot of traditional machine-learning models recognize correlations and patterns in data but that doesn't mean causation,” explains Ben Horsburgh , the lead machine learning engineer on the project. With CausalNex, data scientists can apply machine learning to identify potential cause-and-effect relationships in their datasets. They can collaborate with domain experts to remove spurious conclusions and validate their models, and then use them to find the underlying, sometimes overlooked, drivers of their goal. Ben offers this simple example: “In the summer a lot of people eat ice cream, and there can also be drought. An algorithm could pick up a correlation that says, ‘when people buy ice cream, there is a drought’. These two events are clearly both an effect of the true root cause: that it is hot.” Using CausalNex , data scientists can ask “what if this underlying variable was different?”, and observe the size of the impact. This can help tease out the highest-value features which can then be used to effect change. Here’s a walkthrough of a typical  data project using CausalNex. It takes place in three stages. As a first step, a data scientist uses machine learning to create a structure representing the problem the team is working to solve. It could be, for example, identifying the key factors of sales-team effectiveness. The structure can be visualized as a network: circles would represent the features (number of customer interactions, sales members’ profiles, etc.) and arrows would indicate the relationships between them. This visualization can then be taken to the business team for review: are the relationships accurate? Are any variables missing? At this point, specific industry and domain expertise can be built in to ensure the model’s accuracy, encouraging ownership and adoption of the analytics by the wider organization. “Rather than waiting for two or three weeks before showing the outputs of a model, the early visualization allows data scientists to collaborate with the business team right from the start,” says Wesley Leong , the lead CausalNex product manager. “This collaboration creates more transparency in the modelling process.” After the structure is verified, a machine-learning algorithm models the probability of each circle, or feature, in the network, given the other variables that influence or cause it. This allows data scientists to understand the strength of the dependencies between drivers and the goal and make predictions based on them. Finally, data scientists run “what if” scenarios to find out what happens to the goal if they change a given feature. They can generate more informed, accurate ‘interventions’ – suggested changes that will have the greatest impact on performance. This final step is the most crucial from a business perspective. In the example of sales team effectiveness, for instance, the strongest driver might be the depth of expertise of the sales representative. CausalNex streamlines this entire project process. Such analysis previously required multiple libraries and frameworks, each with a different interface. Now, scientists can work within a single CausalNex library. “Helping organizations achieve truly significant performance gains often depends on understanding and addressing the underlying causes of a situation,” says Wesley. “We believe CausalNex helps to identify these clearly and puts this analytics capability into the hands of our client teams.” Over the past year, the QuantumBlack team has used CausalNex in seven client use cases across industries, including manufacturing, healthcare and banking. Why release this as an open source product? The practice is somewhat new in consulting, though long-established in the tech world. “As a strategy, open sourcing makes sense for us and our clients,” says QuantumBlack partner Sam Bourton . “It helps them to be independent and avoid becoming tied up in legacy contracts or vendor lock-in.” “CausalNex would not have been possible without a global network of leading researchers generously sharing their own studies and papers,” he points out. “By open sourcing this toolkit, we hope others will use it to enrich their own work in causality and gain greater value from their analytics projects.” CausalNex is the second open source product that McKinsey has launched in the past six months. Kedro , our first tool announced in June, has earned more than 1,900 stars on GitHub and won Best Technical Framework at the 2019 Global AI Annual Achievement Awards.

How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery,"Dexter, a new, award-winning device from Swiss startup Distalmotion and McKinsey Design, was built through patient- and clinician-centric design.",2020-02-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20peek%20into%20the%20future%20of%20surgery/dexter-surgery-robot-thumb-2.jpg,"Awards,Design",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-peek-into-the-future-of-surgery,"How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery February 12, 2020 When German internist and surgeon Georg Kelling performed the first laparoscopic surgery in 1901, he likely hadn’t envisioned that machines would one day follow in his footsteps. But today, robotic surgery is a health-care reality that promises certain benefits, like improved surgical precision that can contribute to quicker patient healing times. Still, widespread adoption of the technology has remained elusive. “The traditional approach to robotic surgery brings with it a lot of complexity and high cost,” says Marcus Heneen , a design director at McKinsey Design . Today’s surgical robots, Marcus explains, tend to situate the surgeon at a console in a non-sterile environment away from the patient. This is not ideal. Communication between surgeons and their operating-room teams can be difficult, and urgent manual interventions can be slow. Armed with a vision to address these challenges, the Swiss medical-device startup Distalmotion created its own surgical robot: Dexter . The winner of a 2020 iF World Design Guide award, Dexter is a new system that can be easily draped and operated in a sterile environment, allowing surgeons and their operating teams to quickly toggle between robotic and manual modes as needed. Change that Matters After several years of working on the concept for Dexter, Distalmotion reached out to our McKinsey Design colleagues to help bring the concept to life in a way that would optimize the user experience. “We began by taking a close look at the surgeon’s main interaction point with Dexter: the hand grips,” says Marcus. “We approached the design challenge holistically, aiming to create an interface that caters to control, precision, and comfort.” To test and understand how Dexter might best support the people who would use it, surgeons and nurses were regularly brought in to inform design decisions. “You really can’t design something without being fully immersed in the users’ reality and experiences,” adds Thomas Nilsson , a McKinsey Design expert partner. They gave feedback on aspects like draping procedures, endoscope control, and the setup of imaging systems. “We asked several questions,” says Thomas, “like, how should the whole robotic system be configured to fit with common practices in the operating room? What should the behavior and tactile feedback be like in the grips? What size should they be to accommodate for different physical and habitual attributes?” The effectiveness of this approach is backed up by our research , which shows that for certain medtech companies, patient-centric and clinician-centric design are critical ways to stand out from competitors and unlock positive impacts on market share, access, and reimbursement. “We know from experience that human-robot interaction works best when technology caters to the social setting in which it is deployed,” says Marcus. “Surgery is not a purely mechanical task of making incisions and joining tissue. It’s a collaborative process between surgeons and their teams with a strong social component to it.” Seamlessly integrating robotic and laparoscopic processes also lowers the barriers to mastering robot-assisted surgery. Historically, learning robotic surgery has meant needing to be well-versed in all aspects of robotics. When the switch between robotics and manual laparoscopy is quick and easy, the threshold for feeling comfortable is much lower, making the adoption of the robotic system faster With just two arms that control the robot’s instruments, Dexter is significantly less complex and leaner in size than traditional robots. It offers ample space for the assistant surgeon and optimal ergonomic posture for the surgeon to operate in a seated or standing position, unlike manual laparoscopic surgery that often entails standing for hours. “It’s a real paradigm shift in robotic surgery, where we finally have something that’s not a one-size-fits-all model,” says Thomas. You really can’t design something without being fully immersed in the users’ reality and experiences. Michael Friedrich , CEO of Distalmotion, points to still another benefit of Dexter. “In addition to the cost reductions that come with reduced complexity,” he says, “Dexter will widen the repertoire of operations that can be performed with robotic aid. This means more surgeons will have access to robotic surgery and more patients stand to reap its benefits.” Over the last 18 months, McKinsey Design and Distalmotion have worked closely together to bring this vision to life. After daily iterations and hundreds of prototypes of grips, triggers, armrests, robotic arms, mechanical joints, interaction surfaces, cable routing, and drapes, Dexter is here. “We have tested, challenged, and scrutinized every single design aspect of the system,” says Marcus. “All of this is to transform the operating room for both surgeons and patients alike.” related The business value of design Two Red Dot Awards for McKinsey Design Never miss a story"
How our latest work helps leaders get ready for the 5G revolution,A new McKinsey report and center will guide organizations through the evolving field of advanced connectivity.,2020-02-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20research%20center%20prepare%20leaders%20for%20the%20world%20of%205g%20and%20advanced%20connectivity/5g-hero-col-wide_760292173-1536x864.jpg,"Digital,AI & Analytics,Telecommunications",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-research-and-center-prepare-leaders-for-the-world-of-5g-and-advanced-connectivity,"How our latest work helps leaders get ready for the 5G revolution February 24, 2020 In a highly connected world, shoppers get pinged with promos as they walk by a store. They pop inside, try on clothes virtually, and walk out without checking out. Elsewhere, factory workers conduct quality checks on equipment through augmented-reality eyewear, receiving detailed maintenance info at the tap of a fingertip. And in the wake of a natural disaster, first responders dispatch drones to affected areas, instantly assessing damage and pinpointing recovery efforts. This year, those visions and others will move closer to reality as the world’s digital connections continue to become broader and faster. New technologies, such as high-band 5G , are within reach. Existing technologies, like Wi-Fi 6, are expanding. Novel architectures, like cloud and edge computing, are evolving. And all while storage, sensors, and processors are growing more powerful and affordable. To help leaders understand this tech evolution, we have now published Connected World: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution . The new paper outlines the technologies’ significant opportunities and not-insignificant obstacles. A collaboration with our think tank McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the new research quantifies the economic potential of advanced connectivity across the automotive, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail industries. From selected use cases, we’ve identified $1.2-2 trillion in value that can contribute to global GDP by 2030. And these four industries make up only about a third of global GDP. Connected World is not just about the future; it’s also about today. The report finds that existing connectivity technologies enable some 70 to 80 percent of this economic potential. “A lot of people think it will be the newest technologies that will massively move the needle,” explains Ferry Grijpink , a McKinsey senior partner, “but we believe that if we can more effectively use the profusion of tech we have today, we can see some amazing improvements.” The inspiration for the research traces back to MWC Barcelona 2019 . “We noticed a shift from talking about 5G tech and advanced connectivity to thinking about applications,” Ferry says. “People were very taken with the ‘ remote surgery ’ example, which in reality was very rare, and impractical, since a truly remote location might not be well connected. People were ready for 5G; the tech was ready, but they didn’t know next steps.” So our firm started a series of discussions. A research group, led by McKinsey partner Davide Schiavotto , interviewed industry experts across the globe. “We asked them what could companies do if suddenly they had connectivity at speeds ten times faster, with 50 times lower latency, and seemingly endless bandwidth? How could their performance change? Which use cases offer the most value? What are the hurdles preventing them from fully exploiting what is already possible today?” At the same time, we assembled a team of more than 20 experts and technology partners called the McKinsey Center for Advanced Connectivity , a group dedicated to helping clients develop use cases, test prototypes, and launch pilots. In one example, a telco piloted work with an agriculture business that used drones to monitor weather conditions, reduce water usage, and track field productivity. The telco provided the connectivity while the agricultural company ran the analytics for data, either centrally or on the spot. In another scenario, we developed a concept for an offshore oil and gas platform, the ‘refinery of the future,’ applying advanced connectivity technology to significantly improve speed, production, security, and maintenance. Naomi Smit is the McKinsey partner who leads the group. “Our telco people understand the realities of the tech, and our industry consultants know what is possible on the ground,” she says. “We use Leap , our business-building methodology, and other digital and design capabilities, to quickly build and test prototypes. With our networks, we can convene ecosystems of partners to create end-to-end solutions . ” Taking full advantage of the technology can require a transformation of some work process. Alexandre Menard , a senior partner, offers this example: “A manufacturing company installed a network of 500 sensors in a factory – and had to quickly revamp its way of working,” he recalls. “We helped them figure out which of the corresponding 500 alarms were most important; how to calibrate and respond to them; and how to integrate this new function into the existing practices. Often this meant bringing in new digital and tech talent to work side by side with operational experts.” “We are at an inflection point: there are countless pilots for each industry,” says Davide. “What they need to do now is solve some of the obstacles preventing them from scaling: aligning incentives, creating ecosystems of stakeholders, developing standards, managing the people-side of the transformation—all of which are areas where our firm can help.” Never miss a story"

(In addition, Business of Fashion founder and CEO Imran Amed was a member of our firm from 2001-2006.) Sustainability first It has become clear over time that the global fashion industry consumes massive amounts of energy, generates pollutants, and creates waste. This year, fashion players have recognized the need to take meaningful action while facing up to consumer demand for transformational change. Global Fashion Agenda “GFA’s role is advancing the sustainability of the fashion industry through thought leadership and convening power,” says GFA Vice Chairman Thomas Tochterman. Since 2009, the forum has organized the annual Copenhagen Fashion Summit that convenes the fashion industry, multilateral organizations, industry associations, and political decision-makers to find common solutions to implement social and environmental sustainability. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation Alum Andrew Morlet is CEO of the ten-year-old charity, which has helped put the circular economy on the agenda of decision makers across business, government, and academia. In May 2017, Make Fashion Circular was originally launched as the Circular Fibers Initiative at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit to foster collaboration and innovation in creating a new textiles economy. Inclusive culture Consumers and employees are putting increasing pressure on fashion companies to become proactive advocates of diversity and inclusion. Increasingly, companies will elevate diversity and inclusion as a priority, embed it across the organization, and hire dedicated leadership roles. Chanel In 2019, the 110-year-old French luxury house hired its first-ever global head of diversity and inclusion, Fiona Pargeter. Since then,  Chanel has taken several measures to signal its willingness to change. Among them are the appointment of the brand’s first openly-transgender model, Teddy Quinlivan , who has become the face of Chanel Beauty and its championing of women in film . Next-gen social As traditional engagement models struggle on established social media platforms, it will be key for players to create attention-grabbing content and deploy it on the right platform for each market with a call to action to maximize the return on marketing spend. Burberry In a desire to entertain and connect with new and younger consumers around the world, the British luxury fashion brand has launched several campaigns that stretch beyond traditional channels. Among them are its first online game called B Bounce on Burberry.com and its monthly product releases called ‘B series,’ which are sold exclusively on the brand’s Instagram, WeChat, Line, and Kakao channels. Material revolution Fashion brands are exploring alternatives to today’s standard materials, with a particular focus on more sustainable substitutes. We expect R&D will increasingly focus on materials science for new fibers, textiles, finishes, and other material innovations to be used at scale. Patagonia Guided by its mission to “save our home planet,” the American outdoor clothing and gear company has supported grassroots activists working to find solutions to the environmental crisis for nearly 40 years. Some of its initiatives include its one percent self-imposed tax , which is donated to the preservation and restoration of natural environments and its Worn Wear refurbished clothing line.

March 6, 2020 Women earn about half of science and engineering degrees, but they make up less than 20 percent of people employed in those fields. “I work a lot with women who talk about how stressful and challenging the experience of being the only woman in a work setting is,” says Gayatri Shenai , a partner in McKinsey Digital and founder of our annual Women in Technology and Operations conference. “You can’t be what you can’t see,” she adds. “So, let’s show the world who some of these women in the space are — and what’s possible.” That was the inspiration behind a new McKinsey video series Gayatri helped create. It features prominent women in STEM from our firm and elsewhere sharing their journeys and challenges, reflecting on the mentorship and sponsorship they’ve received, and offering advice to future generations. This International Women’s Day, we’re sharing an early look at the series through an episode featuring a conversation between McKinsey partner Louise Herring and Entrepreneur First founder Alice Bentinck . (For more of Alice’s views on the importance of talent, see “ The people-first approach to business-building .”) We hope you enjoy their conversation. To catch new episodes of the series as they become available, please follow us on social media. Make gender diversity core to hiring The tech world is notoriously male-dominated. For instance, according to our research , the percentage of computing roles women hold has largely declined in the U.S. over the past 25 years. Those numbers are even worse for women of color. In this clip, Alice talks about how the start-ups making progress on gender diversity are the ones devoting extra resources into sourcing diverse candidates from day one. Consider more than cultural fit Placing too much emphasis on hiring only people who match your organization ’ s culture can limit the diversity of talent who join your company— and ultimately the diversity of its ideas. To combat this, Alice encourages companies to go back and think about what their values are today, and what aspects of them will endure well into the future. Using that as a guide in hiring, rather than cultural fit alone, can ensure greater inclusivity. Encourage entrepreneurship According to our research , all-male founding teams received 85 percent of total venture capital investment in the U.S. in 2018, while all-women teams received just two percent. (Gender-neutral teams received 13 percent.) It ’ s not surprising then that women tend to perceive entrepreneurship as riskier than their male peers. To combat this, Alice tries to help women see that the greater risk than trying to launch a new business and failing is perhaps not trying at all. Expand the talent pipeline Getting more women in STEM careers requires creating clearer pathways for women to enter into them, and nonprofits from Afghanistan to the United States are focused on developing girls’ coding skills. In addition to founding Entrepreneur First, Alice also founded Code First Girls : a nonprofit social enterprise that teaches women tech skills and helps companies develop more female friendly recruitment policies. related 3 ways we can help women join the age of automation Never miss a story"

March 26, 2020 Our global managing partner Kevin Sneader joined Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday, March 25, to talk live about the business implications of the coronavirus pandemic. Their conversation, highlights of which are condensed and edited below, took place the morning after US lawmakers agreed to the terms of a $2 trillion relief plan, the largest in the nation’s history. The full interview is available now at CNBC.com . You can read all of our material on the crisis at our coronavirus insights page . On what CEOs are worried about right now One thing is clear from all the conversations I’ve had: nothing is going to be the same. This is a new normal, a different way of operating. I think for our clients, they’re worried about their employees, their customers, and cash—in that order. And they are worried about cash. Even in the health care sector, there are providers who are not getting paid right now, and they’re worried about cash flow just as players in several other sectors are. Another reality they’re all dealing with is that people keep sending them scenarios as to how this could play out. The message we’re hearing is that the scenarios are helpful, but leaders are wondering what’s going to be true across all these scenarios. Because if it’s not going back to the way it was before, what’s the next normal ? What’s the way in which we’re going to have to operate? The reality is that consumer behavior is changing fundamentally, and so much else is changing, and the question is, “will it go back?” I think the answer in many cases is “no.” On the big business changes this moment will usher in If you think about a lot of what’s happened in the last few years, some of it’s going to be reinforced. The shift [to working] online has now been given a boost, and it’s hard to see that being taken back to where it was before. At the same time, I think one of the biggest shifts will be the way that products reach us. For many years, we and others have been focused on efficiency: how efficiently can I run my supply chain? I think now there’s going to be a lot of conversation about, how resilient is my supply chain? Finally, we had books written about the “death of distance,” which suggested it didn’t matter if things were far away from us. Now we understand what distance really means (including social distancing). When things are far away, a lot can happen between here and there. I think businesses are going to bring a lot back where they can control it. On the crisis’s implication for jobs One of the lessons we’ve learned from countries that are ahead in terms of dealing with this is that it’s not so easy to bring a business back if you haven’t got employees. So they’re very much going to be asking, “what is the path to the next normal?” And that includes being very thoughtful about how they can maintain what they have by way of employees. We’re also seeing a lot of companies working very hard to figure out, “if our business isn’t busy, is there another one that is?” We’ve seen a lot of recruiting start to go on because people need distribution warehouses, and logistics companies do need people. So, I think the picture is a lot more nuanced than any sweeping statement as different sectors try to adjust. On the post-coronavirus economy I think it’s going to look different, and I think the way investors evaluate it will look different too. They’re going to build in questions like: is this business resilient? How do we cope with the shock we’ve just seen? Now, let’s hope this is a truly black swan event, but it is going to change the way people think about risk, and it’s going to change the way in which they value that risk. Investors are going to look differently, and CEOs are already looking differently. That’s why we’re not going back to the normal we had before. Never miss a story"

While businesses across the travel and hospitality sectors have been decimated, big retailers and delivery companies are expanding, and are reportedly trying to hire some 500,000 or more people in the next few weeks. FMI (The Food Industry Association) and Eightfold.ai have teamed up to help facilitate this massive shift in labor, widely considered the largest since World War II, by launching an online marketplace that aims to help people who have lost their jobs in the coronavirus crisis find work. Called Talent Exchange , powered by Eightfold.ai, the platform launched on April 6. Eightfold.ai CEO Ashutosh Garg called Talent Exchange “an incredible way to help the community” that promises to help business leaders take care of their people. “If your company is going through tough times, you can place your workers into roles at other companies that need their help,” he said in a press release . “Doing so will fill critical shortages and create goodwill with your workers, in hopes that they will rejoin you when business conditions improve.” Talent Exchange uses AI to match candidates with available roles, based on each individual’s skills and previous experience. Employers send their workforce a link that allows their employees to create profiles for hiring companies to see. The platform helps employers understand how their workforce has been impacted in a single dashboard, and it helps hiring companies find matches quickly and onboard new employees. “Our communities rely on vital frontline businesses in food, manufacturing, and delivery services,” said FMI President and CEO Leslie Sarasin in the release , “and this new Talent Exchange will help many unemployed and furloughed workers in their time of need.” McKinsey is honored to support the effort. We have provided our research on the US jobs market and shared insights from our client discussions across a breadth of sectors to help Eightfold and FMI in their efforts to better understand employment needs and how they were shifting amid a rapidly evolving situation. “In talking with clients across the US, it became very clear that there is a huge labor mismatch and individuals are being affected very differently — from retailers furloughing tens of thousands of workers to other organizations needing to hire more than 100,000 workers quickly. We’re excited to help bring a scalable offering to the market,” said McKinsey partner Andrew Davis . Talent Exchange, available in 15 languages now, is expanding to other impacted geographies and sectors that have a growing imbalance of jobs and available talent. This crisis is reshaping lives and livelihoods. This is one small way of several that our firm has had an opportunity to help. “This crisis is reshaping lives and livelihoods,” said McKinsey partner Carla Arellano . “This is one small way of several that our firm has had an opportunity to help. We’re talking a lot about what the next normal will look like, and we’re humbled to have supported these organizations that are doing great things to help people and businesses.” At launch, several thousand profiles have been uploaded onto the platform.

The new winner of the HBR McKinsey Award explains. April 14, 2020 Most people want to work in a company that values innovation. But they may think twice after reading “ The hard truth about innovative cultures ,” by Gary Pisano , which just won the 2019 HBR McKinsey Award for the best Harvard Business Review article of the year. The things that make innovative cultures appealing, the article argues, require certain kinds of discipline. “A tolerance for failure requires an intolerance for incompetence. A willingness to experiment requires rigorous discipline,” Dr. Pisano writes. “Innovative cultures are paradoxical. Unless the tensions created by this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative culture will fail.” Dr. Pisano is a researcher, author of Creative Construction: The DNA of Sustained Innovation , and a professor at the Harvard Business School. This is his second time winning the award; the first was in 2009 for “ Restoring American competitiveness ” written with Willy C. Shih. He has spent years helping companies, large and small, develop and scale innovation. The inspiration for the article came to him while he was on stage leading an interactive session with a company. “I asked the audience what an innovative culture looks like. They gave very predictable answers: tolerance for failure, entrepreneurial, collaborative, willing to have people speak up,” he remembers. Next he asked: “How many of you want to work at a place like this?” They all raised their hands. “How many of you work in a culture like this now?”  Very few hands went up. “I remember thinking, if everyone wants to work in an innovative culture, why is it so hard to create one?” He repeated the dialogue with groups around the world, always getting the same response. “It really bothered me,” he said. About the same time, the first books and news articles began to appear that cast leading innovators and companies as brutal environments for employees. That audience, Dr. Pisano thought, would benefit from some insight into how to make sense out of the paradox. In his article, he also highlights the specific leadership challenges of building innovative cultures. Its contradictions, for example, can confuse employees, and some of the behaviors these cultures require are tough for certain organizations to embrace. Finally, because innovative cultures rely on interdependent behaviors, Dr. Pisano writes, “piecemeal” adoption plans likely won’t work. “Innovation is valuable precisely because it’s so hard. And by outlining both sides of the equation, I’m hoping to prepare senior leaders for a really tough journey — if they know what to expect, that can make it a little easier,” he explains. But does an innovative culture necessarily have to be so harsh? “There’s a difference between being hard and being harsh. Being hard means I’m going to ask tough questions; be brutally honest; and hold you accountable for painful decisions such as shutting down projects. Candor is uncomfortable. But it doesn't have to be demeaning. We can create environments where people are counted and treated with respect and dignity. And a number of companies have.” Two other articles were recognized as award finalists: The 2019 HBR McKinsey judges were: Bharat Anand, Professor, Harvard Business School; Cheryl Bachelder, Director, US Foods, Chick-fil-A, and Pier 1; Claudio Fernández-Aráoz, former Partner, Egon Zehnder; and Francesca Gino, Professor, Harvard Business School. related How do CEOs manage their time?

Building resilient infrastructure and moving away from fossil fuels, for instance, could help create much needed jobs and spur the economy. “And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future,” our colleagues add, “there is no better time than the present for such investments.” Earlier this year we published “ Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts ,” a flagship report that lays out our best thinking around what’s at stake for businesses on climate change. It was widely covered in the press and figured prominently in discussions at this year’s annual World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos. The report was the culmination of a year-long collaboration between the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) and our Sustainability and Risk Practices. In honor of Earth Day 2020, we spoke with the report’s authors to learn more about how it came together, why they think it has struck such a chord, and why it’s just as relevant now as ever. Our firm has a long history of addressing climate change. In 2007, for example, we introduced the carbon cost abatement curve , which provided a comprehensive framework for understanding how to start reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts But according to Dickon Pinner , a McKinsey senior partner and head of our Sustainability Practice, that work hasn’t generated action at scale or speed. “As a result,” Dickon says, “emissions have continued to go up considerably, pushing the level of risk in the system much higher than it once was.” “Climate risk and response” is our firm’s effort to understand the true extent of that risk. It draws on a detailed and consistent fact base to help leaders around the world make smarter decisions about the future. “Climate science has long predicted the kinds of changes to our environment that we’re seeing today,” says Jonathan Woetzel , who serves as a director of MGI. “Our contribution is figuring out the risks those changes might pose to people and organizations in the future.” The report focuses specifically on physical risk, which refers to the effects of extreme heat, flooding, and other chronic and acute climate hazards. “We chose to focus on this because it’s a driver of other types of risk, such as the costs associated with transitioning away from carbon or with liability,” Jonathan says. For their analyses, our colleagues looked at what’s called Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5—a projection of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. This projection is what climate scientists use to model a world in which emissions continue to rise. That choice was made to illustrate the magnitude of the problem if no actions are taken toward adaptation and abatement, says Hamid Samandari , a McKinsey senior partner and founder of the Americas Risk Practice and the chair of our firm’s Knowledge Council. “It highlights what is likely to be at stake tomorrow if actions are not taken today,” he says. Using this projection, our colleagues partnered with researchers at Woods Hole Research Center , Willis Towers Watson , Swiss Re , and other organizations to figure out the socio-economic impact these emissions would likely cause by 2030 and 2050. The potential scenarios are alarming. For example, by 2030, up to 200 million people in India may face a five percent average annual probability of a heatwave that’s not survivable for a healthy human being in the shade. By 2050, this number rises to 480 million people subject to a 14 percent annual risk of lethal heatwaves. Other cases in the report show similar increases in risk levels. But none of them are foregone conclusions. “It’s important to keep in mind that physical, financial, and behavioral adaption—as well as mitigation—could reduce the risk if those actions are substantial and systematic enough,” says Hamid. This research provides a new and helpful way of looking at the problem, and tees up a clear plan of action on what we need to collectively embark upon right now. Though the bulk of the new report is dedicated to an analysis of climate risk, the final chapter provides some ideas on what to do about it. “The first step is integrating climate science and risk into decision making,” Jonathan says. “Most peoples’ experiences—and many models on which businesses rely—are based on a world with a relatively stable climate. That assumption no longer holds.” The work doesn’t conclude with the report, the authors say. As our colleagues and people around the world continue to absorb the report’s findings, a whole community of colleagues are ready to help clients across sectors. Once a business or organization has understood the risk, the next step is to adapt behavior, assets, and finances to risks that are already locked in. The last step, according to the report, is considering the future; only widescale decarbonization going forward can prevent the further buildup of risk. “Physical risks from climate change are spatial, non-linear, non-stationary, systemic, regressive, and we are under-prepared,” Dickon says. “This research provides a new and helpful way of looking at the problem, and tees up a clear plan of action on what we need to collectively embark upon right now.” related Eight projects helping to reduce our carbon footprint A vision of beauty: How we helped Chile to create ten million acres of stunning national parklands Never miss a story"

In this post, we highlight four articles that focus on the societal side of the coronavirus equation—and offer ways forward on each issue. COVID-19: Investing in black lives and livelihoods Black Americans will suffer more from COVID-19 than any other demographic group when it comes to health outcomes, job losses, and economic suffering. This is due to long-established disparities—in education, in job opportunities—embedded in the communities where they live. While this article outlines the health risks for black people in America in stark tones, it also issues a call to use this crisis as an opportunity to increase the resilience of black communities and institutions, by a variety of both tried-and-true and innovative approaches. These include using analytics to help erase racial bias in testing and treatment, making an investment in telehealth solutions, and expanding broadband communications in black communities to increase access to education. Read more Returning to resilience: The influence of COVID-19 on behavioral health While much of COVID-19 coverage reports on hard metrics—daily death rates, number of hospital beds, rate of unemployment—it’s critical that we also focus on our collective resilience. Almost half of Americans —45 percent—say that the coronavirus has negatively affected their mental health. This article outlines the behavioral-health crises sparked by COVID-19, including addiction, depression, and substance-use disorders, and the staggering economic and social costs associated with them. It then offers pragmatic ways to heal our spiritual psyche, such as community outreach; programs to support basic food, housing, and healthcare needs during a crisis; and innovations such as telemedicine and analytics to reach more at-risk citizens. Read more Coronavirus: How should US higher education plan for an uncertain future? COVID-19 is defining an entire generation of young adults. Waves of college students were sent home from all corners of the world in a matter of days. Many will miss out on a life milestone: graduation. Others are putting academic careers that require hands-on training, such as medicine and performance arts, on indefinite hold. All are facing what can only be described as a dismal employment outlook. This report outlines three scenarios higher-education institutions may be facing as the pandemic unfolds, and presents concrete steps they can take now to keep students and faculty safe—and keep learning alive. Read more Addressing climate change in a post pandemic world In a world fighting pandemic, is climate change still something we should pay attention to? This article argues that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. What may help the cause going forward, the authors write, is that behavioral changes ushered in by this moment, like the rise of teleworking and virtual events, may stick in ways that mitigate the effects of climate change. Elsewhere, supply chains could be repatriated, reducing certain types of emissions that reside across businesses entire value chains. And finally, public appreciation for scientific expertise could rise, along with a greater appetite for the role of governments in tackling systemic risks.

One of them is Ian Lyons . An expert in our Healthcare Systems and Services Practice who served seven years as an NHS England ICU doctor before joining our firm, Ian has taken a leave of absence from McKinsey to help those who need his skills the most right now. On one of his last days at the firm, Ian spoke with us about what he expected to be doing, how he was preparing, and more. Tell us a little about your background. I took a fairly circuitous route in medicine. I was in medical school for about nine years and eventually specialized in anaesthesiology. I then practiced in the NHS for about seven years in the Midlands, mainly as a doctor in intensive care medicine. Why did you join McKinsey? My work was hugely rewarding at the patient level. Over time, I began to see the underlying issues that drove people to hospital in the first place. These included things like poor access to care, poor care coordination, and other inadequacies at the system level. It wasn’t an easy decision to leave medicine, but after several conversations and a lot of soul searching I left to try and have a different kind of impact through McKinsey. I’ve been at the firm for about two years now, trying from a different angle to address some of the same health-system challenges I encountered as a doctor. And then COVID-19 hit. Exactly—and everything changed. Early on in the crisis, the NHS asked former doctors who left the service fewer than three years ago to return and help alleviate the national doctor shortage. I talked it over with my fiancée, who is a pediatric surgeon, and we agreed that I would return to the front line. The McKinsey office in London was supportive of me taking a leave of absence to do so. What will you be doing for the NHS? I’ll be going back to work in the ICU of my old NHS England hospital in the East Midlands. There, I’ll be dealing with incredibly sick patients to ensure they get the care they need. Are you nervous? I’m worried about getting sick as anyone would be. But I find that I’m worried a lot more about the patients who are suffering and dying, and about my fellow healthcare workers, all of whom are trying to deliver the best care under unprecedented circumstances. How are you preparing? For me there are personal, clinical, and professional aspects to it. On the personal side, I’m doing all the things you’d expect someone to do when they get ready to live away from home and the person they love for several weeks—or a few months. As a doctor, I’ve been studying as much as possible and taking NHS training courses in the evening to brush up on my skills. And as a firm member, I’ve been making sure that I’m leaving all my work in a good place with my teams and for our clients. Finally, how did your McKinsey team react? I was a little apprehensive when I approached them about this, but their response was inspiring. There was no debate—and only one question: what do we need to do in order to make this happen? related A new AI-powered network is helping workers displaced by the coronavirus crisis Four insights that explore societal impacts of the coronavirus crisis Never miss a story"
McKinsey volunteers and alums team up to feed healthcare workers and keep local restaurants afloat,"Feed the Frontlines, launched by a firm alum, raises community funds to purchase hot meals from independently-owned restaurants for healthcare workers.",2020-05-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/food%20for%20healthcare%20workers%20means%20business%20for%20restaurants/feedfrontlines-hero-small-delivery-1536x864-c.jpg,"COVID-19,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/food-for-healthcare-workers-means-business-for-restaurants,"McKinsey volunteers and alums team up to feed healthcare workers and keep local restaurants afloat McKinsey business analyst Victor Lal delivering food to a Toronto healthcare worker through Feed the Frontlines. May 6, 2020 In countries like the U.S. where small and medium-size businesses account for nearly 44 percent of the economy and employ about 59 million people , COVID-19 has put unprecedented strain on livelihoods. One industry hit particularly hard is restaurants , and Siamak Sarvari , a McKinsey engagement manager living in Toronto, wanted to find a way to help. At the same time, Siamak’s wife happens to be a physician, which has given him a view into the reality of the front lines of this pandemic. Healthcare professionals, he knew, get very little time to prepare or eat their meals. So he thought there must be a single way to address two issues: support local Toronto restaurants to feed these front-line workers. Siamak reached out to colleagues in our Toronto office, and a dozen replied eager to join the effort. “The idea was to buy meals from restaurants through donations that would then be delivered to healthcare professionals,” he explains. As he was getting the idea off the ground, he heard about a McKinsey alum who had already developed a program to carry out the exact same mission: Feed the Frontlines. Siamak was eager to connect. Founded by Adair Roberts , a McKinsey alum and independent consultant who lives in Toronto, Feed the Frontlines raises community funds to purchase hot meals from local, independently-owned restaurants for healthcare and social-services workers battling COVID-19. For Adair, Feed the Frontlines was born out of an idea to help her friends Luca and Kate Di Pietro, restaurant owners in New York City. It started in mid-March with Luca and Kate delivering 40 donated dinners to the emergency department team at NYU Langone Tisch Hospital. Given its immediate success, Adair then brought it to Toronto. After a few conversations with Adair, Siamak and a dozen McKinsey colleagues in Toronto joined forces. Within a month, the team has raised more than $200,000 from more than a thousand donors and delivered over 5,000 meals to 18 front-line organizations—all as volunteers working in their spare time. “This is the power of the McKinsey training and culture,” says Adair. “It’s been 23 years since I left the firm and yet after a day or two of working with our expanded team, it felt like I’d never left.” The team has daily morning check-ins that involve logistical planning and updates on where deliveries are going, how much money has been spent, and the pipeline for hospitals. “The level of rigor and attention to detail in everything has been amazing to see,” says Indira Coutinho , a McKinsey executive assistant. “At first, we were actually making the deliveries ourselves,” adds Sharmeen Alam , a McKinsey communications manager. “But we’ve since handed that off to the restaurants to manage on their own.” What we’re doing is a small thing. But it’s something, and it helps take away the feeling of powerlessness that can come with a threat of this nature. Currently, Feed the Frontlines delivers around 1,500 to 2,000 meals per week in Toronto, with plans to do more. “We constantly adjust this number,” says Katie Chen , a McKinsey business analyst. “It’s based on multiple factors, such as amount of unused funds, our fundraising target, how long we plan to sustain our operations, and the number of front line teams we support. We want to be extremely thoughtful about how we spend the donations since we know this pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint.” Meanwhile in New York, the effort has provided nearly 80,000 meals to front line workers, and brought more than 100 restaurant industry employees back to work. For Adair, the plan is to continue the support as long as the front line teams in Toronto are working under elevated pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “What we’re doing is a small thing,” she says. “But it’s something, and it helps take away the feeling of powerlessness that can come with a threat of this nature.” Never miss a story"

She had been placed in foster care for two years, where she was passed among foster families, judges, and caseworkers. “I remember raising concerns about my negative experiences to anyone I thought might listen,” she says. “And I remember being completely ignored.” Sherry felt alone in a system that cares for as many as one in 17 kids in the United States, which observes National Foster Care month each May. As an adult, Sherry set out to improve that system. After a career as an attorney and as a policy maker in education and child welfare, she founded Foster America . Foster America is an 18-month fellowship program, partly inspired by initiatives such as Teach for America and Global Health Corps that have created movements for change. Foster America recruits innovators from other sectors with expertise in data analytics and technology, marketing and human-centered design, finance, and strategy and operations. About a quarter of the fellows have personal experience with the foster-care system—as foster children, foster parents, or mentors. Fellows are placed in child-welfare agencies across the country and lead major interdisciplinary reform projects. Half take on preventative work, helping to safely reduce the number of kids who end up in foster care. The other half seek to improve foster-care conditions and dramatically improve the outcomes of children in the system, which has a deep connection to poverty, inequality, and other societal challenges. As many as 70 percent of youth in the juvenile-justice system have been in the child-welfare system; one third of homeless young adults and at least 60 percent of human-trafficking victims have histories in foster care. As many as one in 17 American children enter foster care. Dan Stephens , a senior partner in our Washington, DC, office , didn’t know about the far-reaching impact the foster-care system has on society until he learned of Sherry’s vision for Foster America. “It wasn't just a story of how terrible things were,” remembers Dan. “For Sherry and her team, it was also a story of how there’s so much you could do to make it better.” McKinsey began serving Foster America as a pro bono client in 2016, and Dan joined the organization’s board, leading teams of colleagues to support its sustainable growth through annual engagements. “McKinsey played an essential role in the launch and evolution of Foster America, helping us develop the fellowship program from a seed of an idea into a full-scale program with four generations of fellows today,” says Sherry. We helped design the fellowship’s rigorous selection process and trained staff in interview best practices. As the organization grew, we helped improve its strategic-planning process and operating model, designed board governance and purpose strategies, and trained the executive team. “It’s been so inspiring to see what the Foster America team has been able to achieve,” says Dan. For example, a fellow is helping Washington state design innovative solutions to reduce the pipeline of young adults who go from foster care to homelessness.  She’s drawing on her own background in human-centered design as well as getting valuable input from foster youth. It’s also a story of how there’s so much you could do to make [foster care] better. And in Rhode Island, a fellow used marketing and human-centered design skills to help the state increase the recruitment and licensing of foster and kinship families by 25 percent in one year. This allowed the state to reduce by one-third the number of foster children sent to impersonal institutional facilities, the alternative when no other foster homes are available. In the past three years, Foster America has placed nearly 50 fellows in 30 agencies across the country and is on track to place over 100 new leaders in the field over the next two years. “In this relatively small field,” says Sherry, “that’s enough of a tipping point to have a major influence on the sector and create change for kids.” Never miss a story"
Inside a project that used AI to help survivors of modern slavery,How an NGO used big data and advanced analytics to find the best ways to help survivors recover and reintegrate into society.,2020-05-13T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/inside%20a%20project%20using%20analytics%20to%20help%20survivors%20of%20modern%20slavery/nobletech-hero-colwide-butterfly-data-1536x864-v2.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/inside-a-project-using-analytics-to-help-survivors-of-modern-slavery,"Inside a project that used AI to help survivors of modern slavery May 13, 2020 For survivors of modern slavery, the end of the nightmare is hardly the end of the story. After rescue or escape, the recovery process begins. That process can be long and complicated, and it’s often aided by anti-slavery organizations. Not long ago, one of them, who has worked alongside local authorities to rescue over 53,000 survivors from violence and oppression, recognized an opportunity to improve its global recovery programs. As the NGO developed a 10-year plan to scale the number of people it serves by 20 times, it approached Noble Intelligence —a group of data and analytics experts from McKinsey Analytics that uses advanced technologies and AI to help address social and humanitarian crises—to understand the best ways to help survivors recover and reintegrate into society. McKinsey partner Gaurav Batra helped lead the pro bono engagement. “The client had an ambitious plan to support a million people by 2030, up from 53,000 now,” he says. “And when it came to helping them improve the effectiveness of their programs, we collectively knew data would play a key role.” But the information the organization had wasn’t ideal. Across the client’s field offices, while there was a set of organizational best-practices for managing the recovery process, there were on the ground challenges to uniformly collect the data. This challenge did not, however, mean the client didn’t collect data at all. On the contrary, there was tons of it. “We had information on about 10,000 different cases,” says McKinsey expert associate partner Ashley van Heteren . “That worked out to some 250,000 data points and over 100,000 paragraphs of blinded notes from caseworkers.” Conventional means of sifting through that much material, all of which was completely anonymized and stored on encrypted software, would be virtually impossible. So, the team turned to artificial intelligence, a technology that has broad applications for humanitarian relief that’s being applied in the race for a cure for COVID-19 and in triage for hospitals. “Machine learning could help us understand which services, deployed at which points in recovery, would be most impactful,” Ashley explains. According to Gaurav, the analysis required extreme attention to detail and a quality that’s perhaps perceived to be at odds with data: empathy. “Analytics can feel impersonal,” he says, “especially if the colleagues working on it are located away from the client’s offices and the larger team. This was long before the COVID-19 outbreak, so we made sure everyone on this project was co-located from start to finish, which made communication easier and drove home the gravity of the work for everyone.” The weight of that responsibility was significant. While analytics was an enormous part of the project, the team never lost sight of the lives at the center of their work. “The hallways in our client site were lined with photos of survivors,” engagement manager Andrea Grass recalls. “We saw them every day on the way to our team room. Their stories were very real reminders of the importance and urgency of the work.” In light of this, one choice the team made early on was that they would not recommend removing any existing services the NGO already offered. “We decided that the possibility of a ‘false negative’—a service that some survivors did not like but that is ultimately helpful—was high enough that we might risk removing something valuable,” Ashley explains. Through their research and a 24-hour insight-gathering session with dozens of data scientists around the world, the team helped the client organization gain new insights. For one, timing of case workers’ intervention was even more important in a survivor’s recovery than the NGO realized. “We found that the first 30 days are the most critical,” Gaurav explains. According to the team’s model, if a survivor receives care within that timeframe, they are 50 percent more likely to succeed in their recovery. Elsewhere, natural-language processing and sentiment analysis of caseworker notes revealed that group-oriented services were received positively by survivors, while parts of the process related to their case investigation were regarded negatively. This inspired the organization to seek further investment in programs that foster a sense of community: support meetings and buddy systems to strengthen bonds among survivors. “The hallways in our client site were lined with photos of survivors. We saw them every day on the way to our team room.” According to the client, findings like these have the potential to help survivors increase the speed of recovery by anywhere from 20 to 100 percent, reducing the average recovery period by up to 14 months. In fact, the work has been so promising that the client has already invested in its own analytics team that is capable of stewarding the work that we began together with them. “It was inspiring to partner with an organization like this and see how technology might help them in their mission,” says Ashley. “Analytics and AI are well known for the way they can help organizations make better decisions. In this project, we got to see how those technologies can also give people hope.” Never miss a story"
"For apparel retailers, a tailor-made way to manage inventory during the pandemic","An inside look at a team&rsquo;s work to enhance our Periscope platform and deliver faster, more granular insights that integrate COVID-19 data.",2020-05-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20periscope%20analytics%20help%20apparel%20retailers%20manage%20inventory%20during%20the%20pandemic/periscoperetail-hero-colwide-1088912498-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,COVID-19",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-periscope-analytics-help-apparel-retailers-manage-inventory-during-the-pandemic,"For apparel retailers, a tailor-made way to manage inventory during the pandemic May 19, 2020 Would jumpsuits sell well this fall—and at what price point? Should markdowns start the week before Christmas or after? Should clearance items be moved to a third-party reseller? These were the kinds of questions that Jason Cherok , Maura Goldrick , and Brian Ruwadi, McKinsey partners, had helped US apparel retailers think through on numerous occasions, as they sought to fine tune their inventory pricing to improve margins. Then coronavirus hit—and those questions got trickier: Would anyone have an occasion to wear a jumpsuit? Who might buy one? Clothing inventory is often bought six to nine months in advance of when it will hit racks, and much of it expires every season; winter jackets can’t sell in summer, and fashion styles come and go. In a typical project, a dedicated McKinsey team would work with the retailer to develop and deploy Markdown Advisor , a set of analytics and tools from Periscope , on an enterprise system. The work would often include training the client in how to manage this new capability. But in March, COVID-19 shut down all but essential-goods stores in a matter of days. Many apparel retailers, some of whom had already been struggling before the crisis began, were now having to furlough entire divisions of their organizations, as they watched sales dwindle to a single online channel. “Client discussions started, as they normally did, with topics around inventory management and quickly escalated into existential questions,” remembers Maura. “What was their starting point in this environment? How should they think about their people? How do they calculate their cash position? What will they look like in six months? How will they be able to pay rent? They were facing these incredibly difficult planning issues with a fraction of their former team, and everyone was working remotely for the first time.” The situation was dire and time was critical. “We wanted to use the same analytics capabilities we always had but open the aperture to address these broader, more fundamental questions,” says Jason. “We innovated through necessity. It was like trying to figure out how to change a tire on a moving car.” The team began that transformation by creating a new working model—one that could deploy similar analytics in a faster and more scalable way—delivering insights in as little as three weeks. They swapped out a dispersed, interdisciplinary team structure for a small, central group of more than ten data scientists, translators, and engineers. That central team quickly built an innovative analytics engine on the Periscope platform, that leverages much of the Markdown Advisor logic, but has now been streamlined for speed. A huge body of industry data including COVID information can now be tailored to a retailer’s unique locations, market segments, products and channels. The team expanded the data and analytics capacity, which had already included benchmarks, performance analytics, and historical and current market trends. They added data sets related to consumer sentiment, information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and projections from trusted sources on potential dates that states could reopen. Most importantly, the engine maintains store-level granularity, which is critical for accuracy. In a world that is changing so quickly, retailers can no longer assume that what works in one particular footprint will work in another. “A huge body of industry data including COVID-specific information can now be tailored to a retailer’s unique locations, market segments, products and channels,” explains Brian. Today, clients receive two perspectives through the revamped platform: an overall baseline understanding of their inventory in the context of the pandemic, coupled with store-specific scenarios that model out how different recovery timelines will impact their overall inventory position. More importantly, the revamped platform frees up retailers’ most valuable resource: their people. “It performs the initial data crunching, a giant task, so the client doesn’t have to,” says Maura. “There is more time to translate Periscope’s insights into strategies for solving inventory challenges—and building resilient businesses.” Never miss a story"

He works out of our Silicon Valley office as a consultant in our Healthcare Systems and Services and Global Public Health Practices , and he’s also an infectious diseases and preventive medicine physician with the U.S. Air Force Reserve. In March, the Air Force summoned Sanjiv to a hospital in New York City. We caught up with him about a month into his deployment, which has been his first, and he spoke with us about what he’s been doing, how he got ready, and more. This is your first active duty. What’s it been like? As a major in the Air Force Reserve, I’ve been able to stay close to patient care through volunteering on weekends in hospitals for the last four years. What we’re doing now is different, and it has been extremely hard. There often isn’t much we can do for these patients outside of supportive care. Also, our patients often don’t have their families or loved ones with them. Watching someone suffer alone—and in some cases die alone—never gets easy. Where are you seeing progress? The innovation has been amazing. The hospital has a dedicated team for “prone positioning” that has proven to be effective. They’re responsible for turning patients so they are chest down while intubated. This helps to alleviate their discomfort and aids in their recovery. Elsewhere, through donations of tech and electronics equipment, we’re building out a family engagement service to enable three-way conversations between providers, patients, and family over video chat. And we’re starting to build teams that are dedicated to improving care for patients who are hospitalized for the long term and bed bound. They focus on ensuring small but dignifying things, like the prevention and treatment of bed sores, clipping nails, and oral hygiene. Are you putting your consulting skills or knowledge to work in this situation? In the weeks ahead of my deployment, I’d been learning a lot about what it would take to manage COVID-19 cases: capacity, surge, hospital-utilization rates. They’ve given me a good sense of what our teams can expect as we work across different situations. I’m also bringing a heightened awareness around the way I communicate, which is something we’re trained to do with our clients. I try to frame information in a way that can be easily understood and internalized. It’s something that’s so critical with patients, families, and providers right now. Why did you join McKinsey? I first did a summer internship in 2008 while in medical school. I loved it but decided to go back to medical training since I wanted the opportunity to be a clinician, to experience that level of individual care that’s so intimate and fulfilling. After working as an outpatient HIV primary-care physician and getting a PhD in epidemiology, I wanted to continue working in healthcare in a way that would bring a different kind of change. So, I came back to the firm four years ago to the Silicon Valley office to do just that. And the Air Force Reserve? My parents came to the U.S. from India with very little. My father borrowed $2,000 to go to graduate school and my mother had no money. They created a life here for my siblings and me that gave us every privilege and opportunity we could have ever dreamed of. After medical training and practicing for several years, I thought being part of the reserve would be one way I could continue to serve this country through medicine. I chose the Air Force because the focus on technology, opportunities for advanced training in the next frontier (space), and the high premium on innovation. How is this experience changing you? I’m here for as long as I’m needed—whether that be in New York City or anywhere else. But when I do come back to the firm, I think I’ll do so reinvigorated—with another perspective on COVID-19, what it means for people, and how to think about it. Finally, what is giving you hope right now? I think I’m really fortunate that every day I get to see the incredible things people are doing during this pandemic. I see my wife balance her career and create a wonderful home for our two boys all while I’m away. I see the front line caregivers at the hospital come to work day in and day out to provide care to the very sick. I see clinical trials in action, New York City citizens staying home, and essential workers keep the country afloat. In a certain way, these are inspiring times. related Doctors at McKinsey mobilize in fight against coronavirus McKinsey volunteers and alums team up to feed healthcare workers and keep local restaurants afloat Never miss a story"
Reimagining the real estate industry for the next normal,How one real-estate developer’s focus on digital reinvention before coronavirus is helping it navigate the current crisis and beyond.,2020-05-28T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20living%20and%20working%20spaces%20are%20being%20reimagined/realestate-hero-fullcol-961044162-1536x864.jpg,"Design,Digital",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-will-real-estate-be-different-in-the-next-normal,"Reimagining the real estate industry for the next normal May 28, 2020 It’s long been said that three things matter in real estate: location, location, location. But based on trends that have been reshaping other industries, competition in real estate has spread to another area: customer experience. How engaged, productive, comfortable, connected, and safe we feel in our physical environment matters, and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for significant changes in the real estate industry . Practically overnight, for example, physical distancing and the need for contactless interaction have magnified the importance of digital within real estate. Pioneers in the industry have been exploring ways to diversify sources of revenue, pursuing new digitally-enabled business models and focusing on tenant experience. The pandemic has made clear that those that haven’t yet made such investments in underlying capabilities and infrastructure will need to catch up quickly. Leap by McKinsey “The future of real estate is no longer about delivering four walls to tenants,” says RXR CEO Scott Rechler . “Instead, it’s about creating a unique, personalized customer experience that fosters meaningful interactions, collaboration, productivity. Delivering this will require a unique combination of capabilities that seamlessly integrate across the physical and digital realms.” The joint Leap-RXR team has built products and services for residents that enhance their living experiences. One innovation is a new RXR app that is anchored around a resident experience officer. Designed, created, and launched by the team, the app allows residents to manage elements of their personal lives, like moving into an apartment, and use digitally-enabled concierge services for services like housekeeping and grocery delivery. Tenants can also submit and manage maintenance requests through the platform and make rent payments seamlessly. The entire experience is powered by a robust data and analytics infrastructure that is uniquely tailored and personalized, and enables staff to manage buildings in a customer-centric way. “There’s a huge opportunity to get more use out of data that these digital products create,” says Vaibhav Gujral , a McKinsey partner. “We can uniquely personalize services and experiences to tenants based on information that is made available at the right place at the right time.” Real estate is no longer just about four walls and relying on location for value appreciation. On the commercial office side, RXR is implementing new technologies to help monitor energy efficiency and environmental conditions. As companies consider what office space will look like in the return to work after coronavirus, these capabilities have positioned RXR to move with agility. For instance, the infrastructure created by RXR with Leap’s support enabled the company to respond quickly to the coronavirus, including the launch of a new comprehensive, data-driven program initiative called RxWell. “Helping to ensure an environment that prioritizes safety and wellness is particularly important in light of the coronavirus,” Rechler adds. Leap, according to McKinsey partner Jennifer Kilian , is all about bringing start-up thinking to established organizations. “In this case, that meant working with RXR to build its digital muscle,” she says. Jennifer explains that for any business to change how it creates value for customers, a diverse set of skills is needed across design, data science, advanced analytics, and business. The Leap team helped RXR determine which new roles to create and hire for. After outlining the criteria, they sourced and filled positions like software developers, data scientists, and agile coaches to ensure that the capabilities would live on beyond the initial phases of the project. Through our partnership, the company has built proprietary digital capabilities which are especially unique in the real estate industry, which will enable the organization to move with speed and agility. Building new businesses: How incumbents use their advantages to accelerate growth “Digital solutions have democratized access to experiences and conveniences for individuals and companies,” says Clay Cowan , a McKinsey partner. As people have grown accustomed to digital experiences  like online banking, tele-health, or eCommerce for example, “they expect similar from the spaces in which they live, work, play, and shop.” “We see this work as a catalyst for the rest of the industry across geographies,” says Aditya Sanghvi , a McKinsey senior partner. “Our aspiration is for this to set a new standard and benchmark for how real estate developers, owners, and operators start to think creatively about how they can create better experiences for their customers.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Keurig K-Café Years after it popularized the at-home, single-serve coffee category, Keurig started to see a new wave of coffee consumers emerge: one with a growing interest in quality and specialty drinks. “They had many brewers on the market, but none that quite emulated the coffee house experience,” says McKinsey partner Jeff Salazar . “For that, they needed to launch an entirely new platform.” Enter the Keurig K-Café , which came to market nearly ten months sooner than planned. As the company’s first ever all-in-one milk-based brewer, the K-Café allows users to effortlessly craft customized coffee house beverages in one simple at-home experience. In working with Keurig, the team first began by studying consumers to understand where there was opportunity to bring the coffee house experience into their homes. Driven by a vision to enable everyday coffee enthusiasts to become their own baristas, the team sought to retain the key attributes of convenience and simplicity for which Keurig products are known, but improved for an elevated experience. Cederroth Wound Care Dispenser A compact bandage station to complement the Cederroth First Aid Kit, the Wound Care Dispenser is a clutter-free product for restaurant kitchens, office spaces, or industrial workplaces. “Whereas most first-aid kits we’re used to seeing include medical products for deep cuts with heavy bleeding, the Wound Care Dispenser is supplied with wipes, cloth, and a foam bandage for more minor wounds and scrapes,” explains David Crafoord , a McKinsey senior design director. Partnering with Cederroth, the team set out to create a dispenser that combines elegant form with optimal function. With hygiene the primary priority, the case is designed to enable easy and quick access to the medical products. “We chose a clear transparent case so a user can see right away what’s missing and ensure quick supply refills,” says Lina Trulsson , a McKinsey senior product designer. In the event of an injury, the central bandage cutter is also designed to be operated with a single hand. Mounted to the wall, the kit is designed to look small and lightweight, “almost like it’s floating,” says David. He adds that the system is made to easily take just what you need but not more, thanks to a lock that secures stored supplies. Orion Sync Powered by an integrated artificial intelligence voice platform with unlimited range, Orion Sync is the first LTE-enabled smart walkie-talkie with voice control capabilities. Adapted from an earlier Orion version and compatible with the entire line of tech product solutions, it enables global and dispersed teams to communicate in real-time, a function that is increasingly important as organizations pivot to remote work. The team sought to create a light (Orion Sync weighs less than half a pound), wearable communication device for the deskless workforce—front line workers whose roles are mostly mobile in nature, such as doctors. “Durability was top-of-mind for us,” says Germain Verbrackel , a McKinsey associate design director. In fact, a strong outer casing, along with a removable clip, was chosen to meet the on-the-go needs of workers who are out in the field. Despite its compact design, Orion Sync is fitted with several important features, from a screen that allows multiple users to read messages simultaneously, a primary push-to-talk button, accessible navigation and volume controls, a mute switch, and a panic button. “Orion Sync isn’t intended to be a minimalistic or delicate product,” says Germain. “We knew it had to be rugged to withstand the demanding conditions for which it will be used.” Distalmotion Dexter While robotic surgery is a health-care reality that promises certain benefits, widespread adoption of the technology has remained elusive. The traditional approach brings with it a lot of complexity and high cost. McKinsey Design and Swiss start-up Distalmotion worked together to create a surgical robot Dexter: a simplified and cost-effective system that allows surgeons to quickly toggle between robotic and manual modes as needed.

"In Italy and beyond, Generation upskills thousands of healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19","As the pandemic bore down on Italy, the independent non-profit founded by McKinsey devised a skills program that has prepped 12 percent of the country&rsquo;s nurses for work in the ICU.",2020-06-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/in%20italy%20and%20beyond/genitaly-hero-small-doctors-1536x864.jpg,"COVID-19,Generation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/in-italy-and-beyond,"In Italy and beyond, Generation upskills thousands of healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19 A scene from Generation Italy’s training program for nurses, which has reached about 12 percent of all nurses in the country. June 4, 2020 Since 2018, Generation Italy has trained young people for careers that include working in Java development, hospitality, and sales at boutiques and stores. The program has grown from two to five cities and graduated 800 students, with 80 percent of them placed in jobs. But this January, the coronavirus arrived in Italy and changed everything. In a matter of days, the northern part of the country succumbed to the pandemic, becoming for a time the epicenter of the outbreak in the Western world. Hospitals filled to capacity, while businesses, stores, hotels, and restaurants closed. Generation shut down its operations and classes in Milan, Rome, Naples, and Turin and moved all of its programming online. Oscar Pasquali , COO of Generation Italy, recalls the sense of urgency the team had around the early days of the outbreak. “We wanted to help the healthcare system, so we talked to several hospitals. While we knew we could not actually train nurses, we could provide some skills development,” he says. “What we heard again and again is that the severe respiratory problems created by COVID-19 had dramatically increased the need for nurses with experience in procedures normally used in intensive care units. To cope with the surge in infected patients, hospitals were forced to deploy all nursing and medical staff, including those who were not necessarily familiar with these practices.” The Generation team mobilized, forming a coalition of partners, to develop a demonstration-based online course that showcases the expertise of medical experts. Gruppo San Donato and University Vita-salute San Raffaele, a prominent healthcare group in Italy, provided medical staff who feature in the course’s videos; Sky Italia filmed and produced the lessons; and Intesa Sanpaolo helped with the creation of the e-learning modules. The eight-hour online course includes 35 short video lessons — three to seven minutes each — with practical demonstrations and quizzes to assess learning. Developed and produced in three weeks, the course focuses on teaching nurses how to protect themselves and patients using appropriate personal protective equipment; how to perform and monitor non-invasive ventilation techniques; and how to manage stress in a crisis situation. “We did the filming at San Raffaele hospital in two days, and I was struck by the commitment and strength of the two nurses and anesthetist who helped us,” remembers Oscar. “They were working shifts at the same time. One came in to film her part after a 14-hour night shift ; she had no break or rest. Without them, we couldn’t have done the program. They really wanted to share what they had learned to help other nurses.” “To make the program available to as many nurses as possible,” Oscar adds, “we worked with the National Federation of Orders of Nursing Professions to get it accredited by the Ministry of Health and publish the program on their website.” It is offered at no charge, and grants continuing education credits to qualified participants. In feedback on the program, 80 percent of participating nurses say the course was immediately relevant to their work and 93 percent say the quality of the course was excellent or very good. I was struck by the commitment and strength of the two nurses and anesthetist who helped us. One filmed her part after a 14-hour night shift; she had no break or rest. Without them, we couldn’t have done the program. Several participants remarked on how helpful it is to have demonstration videos, which are not usually a component of nurses’ training. In particular, the content on the non-invasive ventilation and stress management has been especially well received; one nurse commented that “she hadn’t been able to find that anywhere else,” while another noted: “All of the healthcare professionals who participated…were professional, exhaustive and clear in their explanations.” As of today, more than 52,000 nurses have enrolled in the course — about 12 percent of all nurses in Italy — 80 percent of whom have completed the course and passed the assessment, gaining continuing education credits. Two weeks ago, in collaboration with the National Federation of Orders of Doctors and Dentists , the course was extended to doctors and dentists. Twelve thousand of them have enrolled, and 75 percent of those have completed and passed the course. Generation has recently launched similar programs in Mexico, India, and Spain, building on Italy’s success. For example, in Mexico, the program is being rolled out to more than 100,000 nonclinical staff across more than 270 hospitals. In India, more than 4,400 nurses registered in the first four days of the program which is rolling out to more than 1,200 hospitals to start. And in Spain, more than 10,000 nurses have pre-registered for the course. “In the wake of the pandemic, Generation wanted to help our communities,” says Mona Mourshed , CEO of Generation. “So we took our curriculum and learning assets and applied them to supporting healthcare workers to treat and care for COVID-19 patients, and to take care of themselves in the process.” related In just five years, Generation has helped tens of thousands around the world find jobs Doctors at McKinsey mobilize in fight against coronavirus Never miss a story"
Two partners reflect on a historic moment for social justice,"Amid ongoing civil rights protests and Juneteenth and Pride celebrations, Sara Prince and Ana Mendy talk about this moment in social justice, our work and the promise of progress.",2020-06-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/diversity-inclusion--and-social-justice/juneteenth-hero-fullcolumn-595900011-1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/diversity-inclusion-and-social-justice,"Two partners reflect on a historic moment for social justice June 19, 2020 George Floyd’s murder and other recent brutal episodes of racial injustice have ignited a global movement that has inspired many organizations around the world, including our own, to step up in the fight against racism and further strengthen commitments to diversity and inclusion. Last week, we committed to 10 Actions in support of racial justice and equity, and this week, we joined other organizations in signing the Human Rights Campaign’s Business Coalition for the Equality Act . Over the past five years, we’ve also explored the economic impact of closing the racial wealth gap ; the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on Black Americans ; and published annual flagship research on the impact of diversity and inclusion in business. Our latest report on this latter front, Diversity wins: How inclusion matters , was published last month, and next week we’ll publish new research on improving the workplace for LGBTQ+ employees. Beyond the ethical dimension, both find that the business case for diversity and inclusion is stronger now than ever. We sat down this week with two colleagues who’ve led this research: Sara Prince is a partner in Atlanta and a member of the McKinsey Black Network ; Ana Mendy , a partner in Southern California, is a member of Equal at McKinsey , our worldwide network of LGBTQ+ colleagues. Amid ongoing civil-rights protests around the world; on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court decision against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; and as Juneteenth and Pride celebrations get underway, Sara and Ana spoke with us about this historic moment, our work, and the promise of progress. Sara began by pointing out that our latest Diversity wins work reveals the strongest correlation yet between diverse organizations and better financial performance. “Our 2020 research shows the same relationship we’ve seen in our previous two reports, only with increasing dynamics,” she says. “Companies with greater levels of diversity on their executive teams are more likely to financially outperform their peers.” When you take the events that have unfolded recently, they bring with them a hotbed of emotion that makes this important, but difficult, conversation even more uncomfortable. But Sara also explained that making progress in these areas means placing them at the center of organizational conversations. In times like this, that can be hard. “When you take the events that have unfolded recently, they bring with them a hotbed of emotion that makes this important, but difficult, conversation even more uncomfortable,” she says. According to Sara, seizing this moment in a productive way requires facts, which have a way of giving rational context to what could be an “emotionally raw conversation.” This year, Diversity wins examined the data sets from more diverse companies and found the common thread was a systemic approach and bold steps to strengthen inclusion. “What we saw this time is that the dynamics around inclusion matter quite significantly,” Sara tells us. “And while diversity and inclusion are related concepts, they’re not the same. The ways in which people are able to show up, their sense of belonging, the openness of the organization to embrace them matter quite significantly as it relates to their opportunities to progress and to thrive.” Our forthcoming research on the everyday experiences of LGBTQ+ employees finds that despite many visible signs of progress, the business case for inclusion has not translated into solid gains for the LGBTQ+ community at work. And among the actions leaders can take to create a more positive business environment, a focus on inclusion is essential. “Intersectionality is huge,” says Ana Mendy. “When we look at queer women of color, we find that two-thirds of them are ‘ onlys ’—that means they’re going about their day-to-day life as the only person like them in a room, in a meeting, or in a team setting. For the trans community, this is much more pronounced. We know from our research that when you’re an only, you’re much more likely to experience microaggressions—the thousands of paper cuts that add up, over time, that tell you that you don’t belong.” I think the question for clients is, how do we keep this momentum? How do we keep the intensity we feel around this to make long-term change? Ana says she’s also encouraged by the recent conversations she’s had with clients on this topic. “We’re starting to hear from clients across industries—for example, players in food and beverage, wondering how they can drive diversity through their supply chains, and companies in financial services asking how they can tailor their product offerings to broader, more diverse populations,” she says. “We’re also seeing clients who had, frankly, de-prioritized their diversity and inclusion efforts during COVID-19 because they were just trying to survive. And now they’re coming roaring back and saying they’ve made a mistake—that this is as important as anything else, and we need to get this right.” As we partner with clients and other institutions to realize greater racial justice and equity globally, the question that’s top of mind for our partners is how to create change that’s not only impactful—but sustainable. “I think the question for clients is, how do we keep  this momentum?” Ana says. “How do we keep the intensity we feel around this to make long-term change? If we’re willing to put so much time and effort into standard business initiatives, then we need to be willing to make an even longer and bolder commitment to equity.” related New research highlights gap between race and earning power in the US: Meet the authors A McKinsey LGBTQ+ leader who’s helping to build a global alliance Meet our Equal at McKinsey founding members Never miss a story"

Behind the research: Tim Koller on evaluating companies,,2020-06-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/valuation%20our%20runaway%20bestseller%20is%20back%20with%20a%207th%20edition/valuations-hero-fullcolumn-bookcover-1536x864.jpg,Our Publishing,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/behind-the-research-tim-koller-on-evaluating-companies,"Behind the research: Tim Koller on evaluating companies June 24, 2020 From its humble 1988 beginning as a three-ring binder shared internally, “ Valuation ,” has gone on to become the definitive reference for leaders who want to create value, and investors around the world sizing up companies for investment. The book, which has sold more than 1,000,000 copies across 10 languages, has just been re-issued for the seventh time. We caught up with McKinsey partner and “Valuation” co-author Tim Koller to find out why this book endures and what's different in this latest edition. Before we get into Valuation, tell us a bit about your background. I grew up in San Diego California, one of four kids. My dad worked for an aerospace company and my mom for a school and the state highway patrol office. After college in LA, I earned an MBA from the University of Chicago and went to work in the energy industry and then consulting. What was the original inspiration for this book? I joined McKinsey in the late ‘80s, and there had been a wave of acquisitions—some hostile. The firm needed a consistent way of helping clients analyze the performance of and valuation of companies and whether they might be a target. The situation was very similar to the activist investor activity we see today. There were no books—no one knew quite how to do this. Early on in my career, I had helped to pioneer an approach that converted traditional accounting statements into the cash flows of a business, so one could truly understand what a company was worth. We compiled our knowledge and techniques into a 3-ring binder, and distributed it to our newly created corporate finance team. As we used it again and again, interest grew in publishing it through word of mouth. We converted the 3-ring handbook into a comprehensive book that was published in 1990. How big was the first run? Twenty-thousand copies. It was a such a narrow-interest topic. And today it’s sold over a million copies. What accounts for its success? Plain language, practical step-by-step guidance, lots of examples. The book explains in simple terms how to combine and apply finance, accounting, economics and strategy principles to measure the value of a company. It also draws a clear link between these principles and the practical work of creating strategy, managing portfolios, and structuring capital. We use real-world examples to show how growth and return on capital drive cash flows, which in turn create value. Also, we analyze the current, overriding economic, geopolitical and societal events that are influencing business at the time. A lot has happened since the last edition in 2015. What topical issues are we are seeing in this edition? We added some new thinking the importance of long-term decisions as a factor in creating value, as measured by McKinsey's Corporate Horizon Index . Though it’s helpful to point out that we’ve been emphasizing the importance of long-term thinking since the first edition. We also look at the value that environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives can bring to a company, if managed correctly. This means companies need to widen their aperture and focus on all stakeholders - not just customers but also employees, partners, suppliers, citizens. Since there are innumerable ESG initiatives, the greatest value, we believe, will come from focusing on a few that are directly relevant to the business. For example, an apparel company should work on developing a sustainable supply chain or a beverage company might work on water consumption. And we offer guidance on how to value digital initiatives—only 16 percent of companies found their digital efforts resulted in lasting performance improvements . That’s surprising. What makes valuing digital so tricky? Digital can be fuzzy; it can mean anything from a tech upgrade for productivity to analyzing the real value of a “billion-dollar unicorn.” But the fundamentals are straightforward: how much cash flow does a digital program create? How does this compare to an alternative initiative? Or to doing nothing? Many times, a company undertakes a digital project, say a new channel for customers, which may not bring in additional revenue, but it adds value because the alternative of not doing it means losing your market position. It’s the cost of doing business. This edition was in production before COVID-19 hit. How are you advising CEOS today? We recently interviewed 10 long-term investors about exactly this: what primary piece of advice would they give to CEOs? They said… Everyone is looking at what you are doing now—and investors and stakeholders have long memories. How a CEO treats their people, their suppliers and their customers during this crisis will affect their reputations for a long time. One retailer had put its people at risk keeping stores open longer than prudent: this caused an investor view them negatively. Don't think about this year: focus on coming out stronger in 2-3 years. Hire talent from weaker companies, keep your product development going to maintain or build a competitive advantage over shorter-term-oriented competitors. It's a unique opportunity to put your long term-thinking to the test. Tell us a bit about your co-authors We were pioneers in remote working before COVID, because we were never in the same room together working on the 7 th edition. Marc Goedhart , who is a senior knowledge expert in McKinsey’s Amsterdam office and David Wessels , today a professor at the Wharton School, have a unique background combining both academic and practical experience. We’ve know each other for more than 25 years and collaborated on the 4 th through 6 th editions. Because we’d worked so closely before, we could work remotely without losing any effectiveness. And we couldn't have done it without our two editors, Bill Javetski and Dennis Swinford. On a final personal note, how did you spend the quarantine? I live in rural Connecticut and there were 7 of us together in our house – my immediate family of 3 adult daughters, plus a friend and boyfriend. We hadn’t lived together for years so it has been really nice – lots of comfort food and pickle ball. Never miss a story"
"Five days, three designers, and one chance to protect thousands",How a McKinsey Design team came together while working apart to create a mask prototype for mass production.,2020-06-25T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/while%20apart%20together%20a%20team%20makes%20masks/facemask-hero-colwide-sewing-1536x864.jpg,"Design,COVID-19",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/while-apart-together-a-team-makes-masks,"Five days, three designers, and one chance to protect thousands June 25, 2020 On a quiet day this spring, three homes in Stockholm hummed with the sound of sewing machines run by McKinsey designers, who were racing to create a new prototype for what had become one of the most vital products amid the coronavirus pandemic: face masks. “We had five days,” says Marcus Heneen , a McKinsey design director. That was the turnaround time a global air-filtration company gave the team to create the optimal face mask design for distribution at a local hospital. Under typical circumstances, such an aggressive deadline might feel impossible. Design collaboration often involves lengthy processes across several stakeholders. “But in this case, everything the CEO asked for happened within minutes,” says Hans Nyström, an associate design director. “It showed how powerful the  value of design can truly be when elevated to the executive level.” Three McKinsey Design colleagues took on the challenge, each of whom had prior textile and personal protective equipment design expertise. “Within a few hours of the request, we had each received all the needed materials,” adds Frida Ahremark, a senior designer. Then, it was time to get to work. Given the global shortage of face masks at the start of the outbreak—and the growing preference for more local production—the air-filtration company decided to repurpose its Sweden-based production line to make masks. But the line couldn’t perform methods typically used to create them, such as ultrasonic welding or heat forming technologies. “Instead, the masks would have to be sewn in order to be compatible with the company’s machinery,” says Hans. Working away from each other in their own homes—a radical change from how they had ever worked before—Marcus, Frida, and Hans set up their sewing machines and cutting tables and began working concurrently on different parts of the prototypes. “This allowed us to conquer the various elements of the design quickly,” says Marcus. As he focused on the nose clips, for instance, Frida perfected the head strap, and Hans worked on the shape of the mask, which the designers wanted to be one size fits all. “We had to take into account aspects like a tight seal to prevent leakage, comfort against the skin without causing humidity from air exhalation, and enough flexibility in the fabric to allow for jaw motion,” explains Frida. For Marcus, Hans, and Frida, this first attempt at remote team work was a challenge that delivered worthwhile lessons. “Design is something so tactile,” says Frida. “We’re all so accustomed to being together in the same room to ideate, experiment, touch, and see.” But to their own surprise, they found that while physically apart, the ability to solve a complex task together was still feasible. Much of that was a result of agile workstreams and having the right technologies in place. To complete production on the sizeable order, the company hired more than 100 recently laid-off people to manually sew the masks. Through video conference calls and couriers delivering their respective prototypes to each other across the city, the three designers tested different hypotheses and iterated fast—sometimes sewing several design iterations in just an hour. The designers then tested their creations on family members. “Thankfully, between all of us, we had a wide enough sample pool across genders and face shapes,” says Hans. By the end of the five days, the team had hand-sewn 45 prototypes to share with the air-filtration company. After surgeons and nurses from the local hospital evaluated the masks in a testing facility for several hours at a time, five million were ordered for the immediate future as well as for post-pandemic use. To complete production on the sizeable order, the company hired more than 100 recently laid-off people to manually sew the masks. Within two months, 100,000 masks were manufactured for the hospital with production ramping up to 200,000 pieces a week. “The impact has been beyond anything we could have imagined,” says Marcus. “Not only has it led to the safeguarding of lives and livelihoods, it has become an entirely new business unit for the company going forward.” Never miss a story"

A McKinsey doctor returns to her roots to fight COVID-19,This emergency-room physician returned to her training hospital to help respond to the pandemic.,2020-07-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20mckinsey%20doctor%20returns%20to%20her%20roots%20to%20fight%20covid19/marierenee-hero-fullcol-doctors-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,COVID-19",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-mckinsey-doctor-returns-to-her-roots-to-fight-covid-19,"A McKinsey doctor returns to her roots to fight COVID-19 Marie-Renée Lajoie (right) with her fellow healthcare workers in Quebec. July 1, 2020 Marie-Renée Lajoie is among a number of doctors at McKinsey who joined the front lines in the fight against the coronavirus. Before joining the Boston office almost three years ago, she was a full-time emergency-room physician practicing in the Montreal hospital she returned to during the pandemic. We spoke with Marie about her experience and how it has informed her work since returning to the firm. Tell us how you made your way back to your training hospital in Montreal. A McKinsey program allows us to step away from the firm at times between client engagements. Since I joined McKinsey almost three years ago, I’ve been using this opportunity to work at the hospital. When coronavirus started spreading, I was keeping up-to-date with what was happening. I saw that cases in Quebec were expected to peak in March. So, I went. The hospital was the first designated adult COVID-19 center in Quebec. What was initially meant to be three weeks away from the firm became five—I wanted to help as long as I could. What were your main duties? We wanted to make sure the hospital was prepared and thinking about escalation and response planning. One thing we did was fully design a new area that we call our garage. We converted half of our ambulance bay into a completely new emergency department to accommodate walk-in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. This type of work and team culture resulted in the department's high level of safety and performance. There was so much information coming through. A lot of our work was just trying to understand and keep up. We needed to get re-skilled fast and unlearn some things that were deeply ingrained in us to respond to such a new and fast-changing situation. Give us an example of something you had to unlearn. One of the first things you learn in medical school is cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR—pounding on the chest and trying to revive people. With COVID-19, however, most cardiac arrests are due to respiratory causes. So, CPR isn’t going to do much—you need to help secure the airway. More than that, doing CPR can expel fluids containing the virus into the air, potentially exposing everyone else in the room. What was the experience like? I remember the first time I went in the patient room all gowned up. I hadn’t done that in years since epidemics are not something we see often. But we each had a “COVID buddy” to help make sure we were doing it properly—the N-95 mask, the face shield, the gown, the gloves. And mine was knocking on the window saying, “Dr. Lajoie, wash your hands, wash your hands.” It was so different than what I was used to. There were a lot of hard moments with patients. People not knowing if they’re going to see their families again, people asking whether or not they’d be okay before going on a ventilator. But it felt meaningful to be there helping as best as I could. How has it shaped your return to the firm? It’s reminded me of the scale of the work we do here. While at the hospital, I cared for patients directly. At McKinsey, we work with organizations, which means our work is broad and far-reaching—often across healthcare systems. Having seen the impact of COVID-19 across so many levels, it motivates me even more to help strengthen our healthcare systems and global public health as a whole. Lastly, what about this experience has inspired you most? The sense of community I’ve felt—both in the hospital and within the firm. When I was part of McKinsey’s central team coordinating our COVID-19 response at the beginning of the crisis, I’d often hear what our Chinese colleagues and European colleagues were thinking and needing, and everyone was wondering how they could help. Then when I got to the hospital, so many Chinese doctors were putting out their manuals on how they were thinking about COVID-19. Italian doctors were sharing how they were managing. I would get emails from friends of friends in Seattle about how hospitals there were managing. It was a good reminder of how close we can be, especially with technology. And it made clear to me that we’re all in this together. Never miss a story"
How do school shutdowns affect student achievement gaps?,McKinsey partner and former public school teacher Jimmy Sarakatsannis talks about our latest report&rsquo;s findings and how his background informs his work today.,2020-07-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20mckinsey%20partner%20on%20the%20impact%20of%20covid%2019/jimmy-hero-small-1081527972-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Education,COVID-19,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-mckinsey-partner-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-achievement-gaps-in-education-and-where-bright-spots-lie,"How do school shutdowns affect student achievement gaps? July 2, 2020 The damage COVID-19 is inflicting on student learning in the United States could last a lifetime . One of our latest education reports finds that continued school shutdowns could exacerbate existing achievement gaps, especially among Black and Hispanic students, and create overall learning losses that are likely too great to re-gain in the next academic year. McKinsey partner Jimmy Sarakatsannis is a co-author of the report. He spoke with us about the research, how his background as a public school teacher informs his work today, and the potential solutions he's excited about most. Tell us about your background in education before joining the firm. I taught middle school science at a public school in Washington D.C. Teaching was extraordinarily rewarding—and extraordinarily difficult. I’ve always seen education as one of the most powerful levers we have to create social mobility for people, in particular for students who experience poverty and other socioeconomic challenges. One of the biggest things I learned as a teacher, however, is that the challenges students face go well beyond learning. For students experiencing poverty especially the margin for error in their lives is so small. A $50 speeding ticket or medical bill can have enough of an impact on a family to knock a student off their trajectory for a month or more. Why did you leave teaching for McKinsey? I came to McKinsey thinking I should get some management and organizational experience, and potentially return to public schools. But once I joined the firm, I realized how much of a positive difference I could make addressing the challenges of public education through an entirely different lens. In June 2008, the year before I joined the firm, I was teaching about 30 students in a classroom overlooking the U.S. Capitol. A year later, I was presenting to a major stakeholder on our national K-12 strategy, about a mile from my old classroom. I miss the one-on-one interaction with individual students, but I’m also grateful that at McKinsey my work can continue to help improve the lives of students. How does your experience in public schools inform your work today? Not a day goes by that I don’t think about either individual students or my time in the classroom. It’s grounding because it reminds me that all of the policy and strategy decisions we help clients make end up manifesting in interactions between teachers and students, and what students do every day. When I work now, I remember that. The work we do ends up trickling down to affect students and teachers individually. I can see those connections now and know what it feels like to be in a teacher’s shoes—how they interact with students—and it informs what I do daily. Our new research finds that continued school shutdowns will magnify existing gaps in learning for Black and Hispanic students—and also lead more of them to drop out. Among the bright spots we outline, what are some efforts you’re excited about? We haven’t solved this by any stretch—our achievement gaps have persisted for decades. So no one thing is going to move the needle here. But one thing we could do, which a few systems are doing, is to recognize that while not all kids will return for in-person learning in schools this year, we can prioritize getting those students with fewer opportunities generally—students of color, or students experiencing poverty—back into classrooms first. We also have an opportunity to disaggregate the role of the teacher and ensure that teachers are really focusing their time on activities that only skilled teachers can do, and allowing other adults to do the other tasks. This can magnify  the impact and time teachers can have, particularly with students who need it most. Finally, we simply need to get more resources for students who are further behind—we need to ensure they have access to devices and connectivity, and we need to find ways to get them more instructional time throughout the year, and more one-on-one time from tutors to help them catch up. To that point, what role does child care play in education, particularly for the most vulnerable learners? There are two elements here. First, our previous research has found that significant learning gaps are created by the time kids go to kindergarten, which is tied to the opportunities children have to develop in years zero to five. And those gaps typically remain for the rest of their school careers and lives. So yes, we absolutely have to make sure that the youngest children have some sort of developmental support before kindergarten. And the second is just the broader challenge for all parents. If school schedules shift as a way to cope with the pandemic, for instance, parents may need to be home during times that don’t mesh with their work schedules. This isn’t easy for anyone, but  I really worry about parents who can’t afford to lose a shift at work to stay home with their kids. I go back to that margin of error I talked about. It’s stressful for everyone; it’s existential for some. You’re the father of two sons, one of whom just completed kindergarten through remote learning. What has this personal experience as a parent to a remote learner been like? We’re very fortunate. I think about how my son has grown a lot from the time he’s spent with learning software, working with me and his mom, and through his video check-ins with his teachers. Now, contrast that against if neither my wife nor I could spend time with him during the day, or have the technology that lets him work with his classmates. You can imagine how easily a child might experience a trajectory like those we outlined in the report. related What Dutch teachers are learning from their students Never miss a story"

At McKinsey, we believe that we have the ability —and an obligation — to help. Our recently published 2019 Social Responsibility Report captures many examples of how we’re helping create positive, enduring change in the world by giving back to our communities, managing our firm in environmentally sustainable ways, and conducting our client work responsibly. We share this report annually, as part of our participation in the UN Global Compact . While the crises of COVID-19 and racial injustice have dominated headlines recently, the systemic problems that exacerbate their effects are not new. As we continue to contribute our time, capabilities, and resources to make the world a better place, we are proud to share this look at how we tackled pressing challenges and created change that matters in 2019. Supporting communities Below are three examples of some of our pro-bono work from 2019: 1. Our Middle East Office launched pilot projects with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Lebanon and Jordan to improve aid delivery to refugees and streamline financial and operational support for IRC workers and partner organizations. These efforts resulted in the ability for IRC to serve an additional 1,000 refugees through improved delivery-fleet management, a 45 percent decrease in wait time for supplies during operations, and faster compensation for refugee aid workers, who were paid within three days instead of two months. 2. When Mozambique was devastated by two cyclones just weeks apart, we joined UNICEF’s country office to use data analytics to more effectively expedite damage assessments and track relief efforts. We also helped the Mozambique government and other country stakeholders design a program to reconstruct the national school system. 3. Our people continue to dedicate time to Generation , the independent nonprofit founded by McKinsey to address the most persistent barriers to employment for learners and employers. In 2019, more than 10,000 people graduated from Generation’s programs, which have seen over 37,000 graduates to date. Mental health challenges are common occurrences in many people’s lives, but when compounded by crises and other external factors, they can pose a threat to employee health and well-being. In 2019, we introduced Mind Matters—a firmwide confidential support program focused on providing intervention support and increasing awareness around mental health issues. Mind Matters grants all McKinsey employees and their family members access to trained mental health clinical professionals, early-intervention programs, and a website with local points of contact and resources, internal training, and condition-specific information. Operating responsibly Through our support for carbon offset projects like Tropical Mix , which aims to restore a healthy forest ecosystem in Panama while supporting the sustainable production of cacao and timber, our investment in sustainability research and insights, and our own internal practices, we’ve made significant environmental sustainability progress—including maintaining zero net carbon emissions since 2018. We’re also on track to use 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025 and have significantly reduced our carbon footprint by traveling less and working with our suppliers on environmental goals. Women now make up almost half of McKinsey’s global workforce. Our number of female partners has more than doubled since 2015, and women make up 30 percent of our executive committee. We are committed to ensuring diverse representation across all levels of our firm, offering specific sponsorship programs for women and affinity colleagues, as well as flexible working programs, unconscious bias training programs, and equitable benefits to all our colleagues, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. Finally, we continue to invest in our highly-cited research on the business benefits of diversity and inclusion, exploring topics that include the potential impacts of automation on women, the racial wealth gap in the United States, and the economic benefits of full gender equality in the Middle East. Over the past decade, we’ve invested over $20 million in these research efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion and have recently committed to 10 action steps towards combating racial injustice.

The benefits of investing in better health: Insights from our new study,A new McKinsey Global Institute study highlights the economic and social benefits that can be gained if governments and the private sector make good health a priority.,2020-07-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mgi%20quantifies%20the%20value%20of%20good%20health/mgihealthreport-hero-col-wide-1159992344-1536x864.jpg,"Healthcare,McKinsey Global Institute",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mgi-quantifies-the-value-of-good-health,"The benefits of investing in better health: Insights from our new study July 14, 2020 “I always thought I’d be a medical doctor,” says Jaana Remes, a Finnish economist and partner who leads research at the McKinsey Global Institute . Her mother was a pediatrician, and Jaana studied biology and always assumed she’d follow in her mom’s footsteps—until she fell in love with economics as a high-school student in New Mexico.  Thirty years later, with the launch of MGI’s first research focused on healthcare, she laughs, “I’ve returned to the topic!” Prioritizing health: A prescription for prosperity spans 200 countries, looks forward two decades, and analyzes 52 diseases to quantify the economic and social benefits that can be gained if governments and the private sector make good health a priority. To learn more about the findings, we talked to Jaana, who led the team with Katherine Linzer , a partner in our Healthcare Practice who focuses on Medicaid programs in the United States and the role of behavioral care in health. What are the important takeaways from this report? Jaana Remes: We always knew that healthy lifestyles were important, but for the first time, we have been able to quantify how important: What is it worth to the economy when you take care of your people? We found that if we use interventions we already know, we could reduce our disease burden by about 40 percent over the next 20 years and extend active middle age by ten years. Interventions can include behavioral change; environmental improvements such as ensuring clean water; preventive medicine such as vaccines; and therapeutic interventions such as treating diseases with known therapies. And it doesn’t have to cost a lot. With a healthier workforce and the expanded capacity of the elderly, we could see an economic return of $2 to $4 for each $1 invested in better health. So, the good news is that we have a lot of the answers to better health already—we just have to make the commitment. How has COVID-19, the biggest health crisis in generations, changed the way we see the research? Katherine Linzer: It creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity as countries look to rebuild their health and their economies. The pandemic has hurt people with underlying health conditions and disproportionately affected communities that struggle with access to healthcare and other social supports.  Our research shows that these are exactly the people who need our help to strengthen their resilience so that we all can be more prepared for the other crises coming our way, such as heat waves due to climate change. Were you surprised by any of the findings? Jaana: Yes! We often think that the greatest challenge to health is aging. But in fact we found that ill health significantly affects people below the age of 70—with migraines, diabetes, depression, heart disease—making people miserable in their prime years. If we were to implement the recommended changes for preventative care and disease treatment, the average 65-year-old in 2040 could be as healthy as a 55-year-old today. Innovations in healthcare could reduce the disease burden by up to 10 percent. Which new technologies are you excited about? Jaana: During the pandemic, the use of telemedicine and video consultations have dramatically increased so that patients can receive remote diagnoses and do more self-care, managing their own treatment. We have seen devices and apps that allow for real-time data gathering several times a day, that feed into an analytics model and can be visualized through a dashboard. A single operator can look across a spectrum of local patients and instantly know who needs immediate care and send an ambulance. These sorts of technologies are being adapted faster due to COVID-19 and offer tremendous promise. Katherine: I’m also personally excited about the broader set of digital health technologies that can change the way that we treat our long-term care population—including those with chronic physical and mental health conditions—improving their safety, quality, and experience of care. Prioritizing health: A prescription for prosperity The report concludes with four big-picture recommendations, such as transforming healthcare. What happens next? Katherine: Collaboration is the first thing. We want to attract leaders outside healthcare—employers, innovators, investors, and our broader communities—to share the mindset that good health is an investment not a cost and to want to take an active role in innovation, inclusion, and collaboration. We need more—and different types of—minds thinking in different ways and working to support our communities. This is especially true as we try to get back on our feet in the wake of COVID-19. Jaana: There is a role for employers here—they have done a lot to improve safety for their factory workers. Now the challenge is taking care of their knowledge workers, which statistics show are struggling with an increase in anxiety, back pain, depression, and other mental-health issues. There is a lot of appetite in the healthcare industry to share responsibility for the well-being of people within the social and private sectors—and companies are definitely part of the solution. Any closing thoughts? Jaana: What makes me really excited is the thought that we could add ten years to the active midlife with what we know. Imagine how much quality of life we could all get in that time—contributing to your work, enjoying your family, and doing what you love. related The top healthcare trends we spotted at the 2019 HLTH conference An inside look at how the McKinsey Global Institute creates a better understanding of the world Never miss a story"

Without sustained action, the amount of plastic leaking into the ocean will increase dramatically. This week McKinsey.org partnered with the United Nations and GreenBiz to host Reimagining Ocean Action: Youth Innovation , a virtual event that convened young innovators from around the world to share solutions and strategies to protect the ocean. Dhia—who works on Rethinking Recycling, the flagship program of McKinsey.org—was among the four youth innovators who shared ideas at the event. She was joined by Lalita Junggee, whose work focuses on the connection of clean oceans to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals ; Sarah Travers, who uses GPS and data to track and encourage sustainable fishing; and Chiagozie Udeh, who studies climate’s connection to the ocean. While ocean waste has long been a challenge, COVID-19 has intensified the urgency to act on this problem. “Lockdown orders and an economic slowdown have brought supply chains for recycled products to a near standstill, even as demand soars for products made with recycled materials such as toilet paper, canned goods, and shipping boxes,” says Shannon Bouton , a field biologist by training who leads McKinsey.org’s work on Sustainable Communities. “The cost of waste that is not properly managed is estimated to be trillions of dollars annually in ecosystem damage to the environment and public health.” Dhia spoke about why protecting the ocean starts with ensuring that waste gets recycled and never ends up leaking into the water, drawing on her work in Indonesia. The cost of waste that is not properly managed is estimated to be trillions of dollars annually in ecosystem damage to the environment and public health. As part of Rethinking Recycling’s Indonesia program, Desa Kedas, which means “clean village,” Dhia works side by side with community leaders to re-engineer underutilized government waste management facilities into thriving community-driven recycling centers in Bali’s capital city, Denpasar. To date, the program has helped divert roughly 50 percent of waste from landfill and increased essential waste worker wages by 200 pecent. “What we’ve learned through Rethinking Recycling is that the way to solve our global waste problem is to ensure that we empower local communities with the tools and skills to solve for waste recovery, to have ownership, and to contribute to the solution at large,” she says. The team is now building the Rethinking Recycling Academy to scale the pilot’s success across Bali and other cities in Southeast Asia. Born and raised in Indonesia, Dhia considers this work deeply personal. “Growing up in an archipelago means you know exactly where the fish that you eat came from—you know the fishermen villages as well as their lives, and you see children playing by the beach,” she shares. “That’s why I want to dedicate this period of my life to solving this issue.” related How McKinsey.org is helping to rethink recycling around the world Never miss a story"
A global lockdown opens up new manufacturing insights,"The ‘lighthouses of manufacturing’ initiative, which identifies the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world, does some innovating of its own.",2020-07-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/lighthouses%20of%20manufacturing/lighthouses-hero-full-col-1138216393-1536x864.jpg,"Digital,Operations",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-global-lockdown-opens-up-new-manufacturing-insights,"A global lockdown opens up new manufacturing insights July 20, 2020 The “ lighthouses of manufacturing ” initiative, a joint project by McKinsey and the World Economic Forum (WEF), was in its third year—and full swing—when COVID-19 hit. The project identifies global manufacturing sites that have delivered significant operational and financial impact by adopting leading-edge technology at scale. These lighthouses then share their insights with other companies to advance innovation across the manufacturing industry. The work has so far identified 44 lighthouses around the world, factories with self-driving vehicles, collaborative robots, virtual reality, lights-off operations, and more. With employees as the creative force leading the changes, the results can be eye-popping improvements in performance. In mid February, as the pandemic began to shutter factories and businesses, the lighthouses were often in a better position to respond because they could be managed remotely, using digital technologies. With full transparency into the supply chain from end to end, teams were able to adjust quickly to changes, fine-tuning their processes, timing, and outputs. Several lighthouse factories were able to re-purpose their production lines to produce personal protective equipment  (PPE) such as face masks, face shields and ventilators in as little as a few days. Meanwhile, Yves Giraud , a McKinsey senior expert and project lead, Federico Torti and Franco Manna , project leads for WEF, needed to find a way to continue learning from sites in China, the Middle East, North America, and Western Europe — without traveling. “We immediately started looking at how we might do the visits virtually,” remembers Yves. “We tested a variety of technologies for remote video and audio connectivity with a local factory to reproduce the experience of a physical site visit.” Within two weeks, the team was able to move from physical to completely virtual visits. They felt good about what they had achieved, but they recognized that it would likely fall short of what they had come to expect from their live inspections. But they were pleasantly surprised. “We found that the virtual visits could be more informative,” says Yves. All participants sign into a Zoom meeting and share the same view. An operator can stream a demo from the factory floor using Google Glass . With a video camera on a gimbal, viewers can see deep into the different positions and angles of machines and tools that they can’t physically see in person. And while watching the demo, meeting participants can refer to charts in parallel on the screen, gaining a deeper context. ""A variety of experts can also be on hand to answer questions,” Yves adds. During a recent virtual site inspection, an operator on a plant floor demonstrated a new digital solution for running a complex piece of machinery. The discussion then switched to a manager in her home dining room who oversees maintenance remotely during off hours, using a digital dashboard. The audience could ask questions of both the operator on the floor and the maintenance manager in her home. In addition to offering greater flexibility in viewing technologies, virtual visits can save time and money for those doing the site inspections. Physical visits typically require six to eight hours of travel, with overnight hotel stays and a minimum of eight hours on site. Some environments, such as a semiconductor clean room that must be particle free or a foundry, may require added time for dressing up in protective gear. In comparison, virtual site inspections run about six hours, split over two days. With virtual site inspections… you can get a clearer, deeper understanding of the solution in a shorter time. Of course, there are trade-offs that come with remote tours. “With virtual site inspections, you may lose something in terms of relationship building, but you can get a clearer, deeper understanding of the solution in a shorter time. They make sense when a factory is in a very remote location, there are multiple sites in a value chain, or access to the shop floor is limited for some reason,” says Yves. “But we’ll never go back to 100 percent fully physical visits.” related At these factories, robots are making jobs better for workers Never miss a story"
How machine learning is helping take waste out of aquaculture,A predictive machine learning model helps a company accurately forecast for farmers how much&mdash;and when&mdash;to feed their fish.,2020-07-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20a%20mckinsey%20team%20is%20making%20waves%20in%20aquaculture%20with%20advanced%20analytics/aquaculture-hero-col-wide-155071749-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Latin America",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-machine-learning-is-helping-take-waste-out-of-aquaculture,"How machine learning is helping take waste out of aquaculture July 23, 2020 Seafood demand around the world has significantly increased over the past 50 years—and the trend shows no sign of stopping. In fact, global fish consumption is predicted to increase by 20 percent from 2016 to 2030 because of population growth, the expansion of the middle class, and greater urbanization (more people have access to seafood, as well as the electricity and refrigeration needed to store it). As fishing players try to meet this growing demand while also preserving marine biodiversity, they’re increasingly turning to advanced analytics capabilities to optimize their operations, costs , and improve management of ocean resources. Take a Latin American consumer goods company that provides animal feed, for example: As a smaller regional enterprise that can’t beat its multinational competitors’ margins, the organization had to find an innovative way to distinguish its offerings in the industry—and turned to us to help them land a new idea. Jorge Grieve , an associate partner at McKinsey who led the project, explains that 60 percent of fish farmers’ costs comes from purchasing food. “Much of it is excess that’s ordered and wasted due to varying fish appetite,” he says. Without visibility into the precise eating habits and other external factors that affect fish feeding patterns, like temperature or oxygen levels, it’s typically a challenge for farmers to know just how much they really need to purchase. Using the feed provider’s data on its customers’ purchasing behaviors, such as salmon farmers, the McKinsey team built a predictive machine learning model that accurately forecasts and prescribes to farmers how much—and when—to feed their fish throughout their lifecycle. The model assesses external factors like weather, sea current, oxygen levels, and location that impact the weight and size of fish and, consequentially, the amount of food they will consume at different periods of time. “This is critical insight to have since the necessary quantity of feed correlates with fish weight,” says Melissa Fitts , a senior engagement manager at McKinsey. “And if we can reach target weights in less time and with less feed, fish production costs go down, and the client saves customers money, increasing their loyalty.” For aquaculture or agriculture players today, being powered by digital and analytics is critical. Being so prone to such volatility in crop yield, this type of technology opens up a world of opportunities for greater productivity—and sustainability. The predictive model uses data to measure the efficiency of salmon converting feed into farmers’ desired weights and sizes. It’s run on a weekly or monthly basis for the algorithm to learn which combination of feed practices and external factors yields the best outcomes in the shortest time. Each week, the food and growth predictions are sent to customers. “There are so many variations in growth of fish that are usually not explained,” says Guillaume Baquiast , a senior data scientist at QuantumBlack . “Being able to predict the growth rate and recommend the right amount of food is game changing.” McKinsey for Kids: Hungry fish, baffled farmers, and what happened next Melissa says that as the model is integrated into the feed provider’s ways of working, farmers are expected to increase their productivity by up to eight percent. This means achieving their desired fish weight using less feed, less waste, and lower costs. “What’s significant is the client has positioned itself as more than just a commodity to customers,” says Pepe Cafferata , head of QuantumBlack in Latin America. “They’re now able to partner with multiple technology companies to offer a value-add of advice and an unprecedented level of trust in an industry where many producers oversell composition of their formula to gain contracts.” Next up, the team is applying its learnings from other industries to create an IoT and advanced analytics center of excellence for the client. This summer, they have started piloting IoT devices, like program feeders that give exact food quantities and computer vision cameras that estimate body mass, weight, and movement. They are also building a cloud-based data lake that will eventually stream data in real time to the multiple advanced-analytics models, 24/7, in the coming months—leading the way for even more impact. “For aquaculture or agriculture players today, being powered by digital and analytics is critical,” Pepe says. “Being so prone to such volatility in crop yield, this type of technology opens up a world of opportunities for greater productivity—and sustainability.” Never miss a story"
What I learned from a conversation with John Lewis,Partner Jason Wright reflects on a chance meeting with the late civil rights legend.,2020-07-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/what%20i%20learned%20from%20a%20conversation%20with%20john%20lewis/johnlewis-hero-small-missybabcockphoto-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/what-i-learned-from-a-conversation-with-john-lewis,"What I learned from a conversation with John Lewis A mural of the late civil rights leader John Lewis in Atlanta, Georgia. Photo by Missy Babcock. July 24, 2020 When I was a senior associate, I had the honor of spending a few hours with John Lewis, the late U.S. Congressman representing Georgia’s Fifth District. I was returning from a client engagement in New York, awaiting my regularly delayed flight from LaGuardia Airport when I noticed him seated across from me. As the son of civil rights activists (my father was a Black Panther turned racial reconcilist and my great uncle an activist professor at Tuskegee), I spent every Saturday learning about Black history. And though this gentleman was sitting quietly at the gate, I knew his unassuming nature belied his formidable legacy. John Lewis was a civil rights icon who dedicated his life to advancing Black rights in the United States. He was one of the founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, leading lunch-counter sit-ins in the Jim Crow South, one of the 13 original Freedom Riders who challenged segregation in public transportation in 1961, and one of the organizers and speakers at the March on Washington in 1963. He was in the inner circle of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and his arrest and beating by law enforcement catalyzed the civil rights movement in Selma, Alabama, galvanizing support for the Voting Rights Act. For the past 33 years until his death, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thrilled by the opportunity to meet a legend, I walked over to John Lewis, introduced myself, and told him what an honor it was to meet him. He invited me to sit down with him, and we had a conversation that was, to me, remarkable. First, he deflected all of my praise and deference, quickly pivoting to asking me questions about myself. He wanted to know my story. So, I began telling him about my parents’ big push on education, economic empowerment, and how they thought about elevation of socioeconomic class as the real marker for success. At some point during the conversation, I realized I had been talking about myself for some time. I expected him to offer stories about his own experience, but he didn’t. Instead, he said, “You’ve done amazing things for someone who is 33 years old. But I’m curious, what drives you?” I had an answer to his question that I think about often. I said, “I’ve been privileged to enter sectors and spaces where people who look like me have not traditionally been. These are places that were closed to my parents, even legally at times. And when I’m in these spaces of influence, I want to learn the ways of that place and use the influence for things I care about. I want to use it for the empowerment of groups and individuals who have been marginalized.” We eventually segued into the topic of then-U.S. President Barack Obama, whose election represented an enormous milestone. We discussed what that said about the American psyche; how hopeful it made us, irrespective of supporting the president’s politics. John shared what excited him most about where the nation was heading in terms of race relations. Where the nation was heading at the time was toward an increasing number of young people in leadership positions across the political and corporate landscapes. I mentioned that I was not so confident about the ability of the younger generations to lead in the ways we needed—my impression was that they were not as resilient; they always wanted everything and everybody to be accommodating and inclusive and seemed unwilling to accept that that’s simply not how the real world operates. I paused, expecting John to agree with me, but he didn’t. Perhaps most importantly, [John Lewis] leaves behind a legacy of change through persistence. It’s this quality, he proved, that changes mindsets, social structures, and policies. “Actually,” he said, “I love what young people are doing because they are pushing me and everybody else to have a higher bar for what it means to be included and accepted. They might be wild and uncalibrated, but they are the fire that we need. The old fire is not going to get us where we need to go. I listen to these young people, and I take them seriously. When I don’t understand them, I keep asking questions. And I think you should too.” It’s a challenge that has echoed strongly in my ears over the last few months, as the nation and the world started a dialogue in reaction to the murder of George Floyd. We as a firm have decided to use our Values to join that narrative and be leaders both for colleagues and for the broader marketplace on the topic of racial equity and justice—how to talk about it and lead on it through one’s business model. And to the
Congressman’s credit, he was right: It is largely younger generations who continue to raise and propel these issues to the forefront of the global conversation. Instead of approaching this discussion with my normal curmudgeon mindset, I thought about what John Lewis said, and I decided to listen. And I encouraged other people to listen. I took in perspectives that I might initially have thought of as too radical or unrealistic and realized that’s actually what we need to move things forward. As we neared the end of our conversation, John invited me to come visit him in his office in D.C. I followed up with an email to his chief of staff, but when I didn’t hear back, I never reached out again. Looking back, I wish I had. The time I spent with John Lewis was marked by his selflessness and his encouraging demeanor, which let him both correct and affirm me with the same smile and warmth. I will remember him as a pragmatic-yet-extraordinary leader who encouraged us all to be bold, to embrace “good trouble,” and to listen at least as much as we speak. Perhaps most importantly, he leaves behind a legacy of change through persistence. It’s this quality, he proved, that changes mindsets, social structures, and policies. I know I will do my part to steward his legacy, and I hope you will join me—though you may face pushback when advocating within your community, it’s through persistence that you will find courage, optimism, and ultimately action. Rest in peace, Representative John Lewis (February 21, 1940 – July 17, 2020). related COVID-19: Investing in Black lives and livelihoods Never miss a story"
Partnering with UNESCO to help school systems respond to COVID-19,"As educators weigh back-to-school options, online tool kits offer resources for creating new approaches to learning.",2020-07-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/as%20the%20pandemic%20tests%20education%20systems%20online%20tool%20kits%20offer%20answers/unesco-hero-col-wide-1224902548-1536x864.jpg,"COVID-19,Education,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/as-the-pandemic-tests-education-systems-online-tool-kits-offer-answers,"Partnering with UNESCO to help school systems respond to COVID-19 July 29, 2020 In California, school districts are converting buses into internet hot spots for e-learning. In Denmark, teachers are moving music and other classes outside to gain the extra space needed for social distancing. In Gambia, teachers are recording and broadcasting lessons for all grades through TV and radio and have distributed more than 2,000 radios across rural areas. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to shut down schools around the world, educators and policy makers have been experimenting with new approaches to learning: in person with stringent new health requirements; remote learning; and using a variety of hybrid models. To help systems adapt to this new reality, McKinsey joined UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition to co-develop a practical resource for education system leaders as they work to ensure learning continuity and provide support, especially for vulnerable students. This took the form of a series of tool kits . “Early this spring, as the pandemic took hold, we started work to understand the options for school systems in responding to the shutdowns,” explains Emma Dorn , McKinsey Education Practice manager. “We found out that UNESCO had a similar initiative, so we joined forces—bringing together our knowledge and resources with its in-country networks and expertise.” The five tool kits help administrators define a model for operating during the crisis , set up effective remote - and hybrid-learning programs , develop strategies for minimizing dropout rates and ensuring re-enrollment once the crisis is past, and help students regain lost learning . They range from 40 to 70 pages and provide system leaders at the national, state, and district levels with fact bases and questions they can work through to create models for learning that best suit their context. They are detailed, covering such topics as how to assess available physical space and teacher capacity for in-person learning; how to decide which age groups, subjects, and parts of the teaching process will work best in-person and remotely; and how to determine the best ways to engage teachers, families, and students. They include checklists and numerous case studies from around the world. “There is no such thing as a best practice yet: it’s too early. Everyone is moving at 100 miles an hour and reacting very quickly, trying different things,” observes Emma. “We looked at previous crises, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Ebola outbreak, for lessons learned and have included those.” Nawal M’jahad , an engagement manager who led the project, explains that the disruption to traditional, in-class learning caused by a health crisis can sometimes offer education systems the chance to address more existential issues. ""During the Ebola outbreak, schools initially used radio and TV for remote learning but then realized it also created an opportunity to improve curriculum content and engage parents,” she says. Ebola also disproportionately affected girls. ""While schools were out, teen-pregnancy rates dramatically increased within households—often as a result of abuse,” Emma points out. “During crises, we need to give extra attention to our most vulnerable students. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, that might be students without internet or device access, students with special needs, or those who are not safe at home.” While many administrators are focused on how to get kids back to school, what happens when things go back to “normal” following the pandemic can be even more important. “During the Pakistan earthquake in 2005, children missed three months of school. We found that, four years later, they were still one-and-a-half years behind,” says Nawal. “That’s why remediation strategies are so important to think about now.” Once a school system sets its strategy, it can work through a variety of UNESCO partners to piece together needed resources, such as enhanced connectivity from telcos and health-safety guidelines from Johns Hopkins University. In many places around the world, schools provide more than an education. “They support their students and their communities with social services, nutrition, mental health, and medical help,” points out Emma. “With such an encompassing role, schools can became agents of change. That’s the sort of thinking we want to encourage.” related How do school shutdowns affect student achievement gaps? Never miss a story"
Our North American leader talks work flexibility amid COVID-19,"Long before remote working and alternative work schedules were commonplace, Liz Hilton Segel found a way bring balance into her life.",2020-08-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/our%20north%20american%20managing%20partner%20talks%20work%20flexibility%20in%20a%20post%20covid%20world/lizhiltonsegel-hero-small-1536x864-v2.jpg,"Our People,COVID-19,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-north-american-managing-partner-talks-work-flexibility-in-a-post-covid-world,"Our North American leader talks work flexibility amid COVID-19 Liz and her family on vacation in Rhode Island August 4, 2020 Liz Hilton Segel joined McKinsey’s New York office in 1992 fresh out of college. More than 25 years, hundreds of client projects, a marriage, and two children later, Liz is now the firm’s managing partner for North America, the first woman to hold this leadership role at our firm. Along the way, she’s made some tough and often unconventional choices, like working part-time for five years to spend more time with her kids when they were young. But as Liz explains it, staying true to herself, her family, her colleagues, and clients have been driving forces that have guided her entire career. “Letting people know where I stand helps to build trust with the clients I serve and the colleagues with whom I work,"" she says. ""But honesty shouldn’t stop with colleagues and clients. It’s also important to be honest with yourself.” As flexible and remote working amid COVID becomes a day-to-day norm for most colleagues, we spoke with Liz on how she’s made that a priority for herself—and ways people can do the same in this new working environment. You found a way to bring balance into your life long before remote working and alternative schedules were commonplace. How? When my son was six, he told me he wanted me to pick him up from school every now and then. My daughter was three at the time and she wanted a parent to join her for more school activities. There wasn’t an obvious solution at the time, but my husband and I took their requests seriously and worked through how to make this possible. I couldn’t picture myself working part-time, and back then, flexible programs weren’t widely used at McKinsey. But I was very fortunate to be able to structure an arrangement from 2007 to 2012 where I took eight weeks of vacation to match the kids’ school vacation, and I took another two days off a month. I was able to spend quality time with them when they were off from school. Each month, I selected days off that were important in my children's lives but that also allowed me to be available to my clients and my teams. What can leaders do to help promote greater flexibility going forward? Managing family and work-life balance is important for all of us, but it’s particularly important for leaders to model our values. We’re all human and we need to encourage “pulling back the curtain” on our personal lives so we have a better sense of who our colleagues are, and to allow ourselves to extend more compassion and understanding. My part-time arrangement required a deliberate decision to craft something that didn’t exist. Early on, I realized that the choices I made were helping others envision and pursue alternative models for their careers. I found that to be very powerful and made it a priority to advocate for McKinsey’s working parents—and all our colleagues—to help shape “new normals” that would help others thrive. Today, my kids are grown and I’m back to full-time work, but I don’t hide the fact that while I’m speaking to a client or a reporter, I might also be responding to a question my daughter has about her summer internship or navigating what a return to campus looks like for my son, who’s supposed to continue his second year at college this fall. In times of crisis or not, we know that compassionate leaders perform better and foster more loyalty and engagement from their teams. It’s for these reasons that it’s so crucial to tune in to what employees are feeling and seek continuous feedback to incorporate into programs and culture going forward. COVID-19 has changed what all of our routines look like. What does a typical work day look like for you now? Over the last few months, no day has looked the same. The lack of travel has been a double-edged sword for me. On one hand, it’s allowed me to free up more time for meetings and client work. On the other, it’s blurred boundaries between work and personal time. But I’ve found that having even just a few moments of quiet reflection between meetings can be hugely beneficial and restorative. So, I do my best to create space for that time. I carve out time each day to be present for my family and try to exercise every day, whether that’s taking an early morning walk or squeezing in a cycling ride. And as many colleagues well know, I am committed to getting my daily eight hours of sleep. Any surprise learnings about yourself during this time? I’ve been surprised at how much we can get done virtually and how connected I still feel with co-workers and clients during this time. Seeing everyone in their home environments—with cameos from kids or pets during conference calls—has allowed me to get to know my colleagues on a more personal level. On the home front, as a family we have embraced new traditions brought on by the quarantine, like going for hikes, cooking more frequently, and celebrating holidays in new ways (including making our own matzo for Passover). I can’t say with certainty that we will be eager to make the matzo every year, but these experiences have allowed us to connect more deeply as a family—and for me, that has been an unexpected, positive outcome of this challenging time. Of all the behavioral changes that have come with this pandemic, which do you hope stick? Right now, nearly everyone across the globe shares the same uncertainty about the future. What we’ve learned is that people are looking to the leaders they work with for guidance and support in preserving mental and emotional resilience. This can even start with a simple: “How are you?” This period has definitely shown me that simply checking in with people and asking how they’re doing can go a long way. On a personal note, the switch to remote communication has inspired me to connect with many friends and family that live across the globe that I don’t often get to catch up with. My college roommates and I are spread across the U.S. and Asia and have done virtual cocktails and enjoyed a few meals together over FaceTime. I hope we continue to get together in this way going forward. related Four insights that explore societal impacts of the coronavirus crisis Never miss a story"

Part of the country’s tapestry since the 1800s, they comprise nearly 6 percent of the U.S. population and are a powerful economic force: 2 million Asian American businesses generate $700 billion in annual GDP and employ around 3.6 million people. But as our new report COVID-19 and advancing Asian American recovery finds, this cohort has historically been overlooked despite their wide-ranging contributions to U.S. society. COVID-19 has only brought this dynamic into sharper relief: Asian Americans have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic—a theme also felt by the Black, Hispanic and Latino, and small business communities, too—and analysis of past economic downturns suggests that Asian Americans experience more serious and prolonged rates of unemployment. We spoke to two of the report’s authors, McKinsey partners Emily Yueh and Harrison Lung, who are also part of the core leadership team of our ‘ Asians at McKinsey ’ affinity group. They spoke about the report’s most important findings and their own Asian-American experience during COVID-19. Where did the idea to pursue this research begin? Emily: At the onset of COVID-19, we wanted to understand the unique impact it was having on Asian American lives and livelihoods. Asian Americans contribute substantially to the U.S. economy—for example, our research finds that 25% of Asian-owned businesses employ more than one person, nearly twice the U.S. average (13%)— but language barriers prevented many Asian Americans from participating in COVID-19 relief programs. Of the four financial-relief services offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, none of the websites provide translations into Asian languages. Harrison: And as the pandemic pressed on, we looked at the lives that were lost, the mental toll it has taken on Asian Americans, especially amid rising xenophobia, and the many contributions this community has made during these unprecedented times, from essential workers on the frontlines, such as doctors, nurses, and food service employees, to the number of small and medium businesses that Asian Americans own and operate. The research took a poignant importance as we saw the world respond to racial injustice. We felt it was important to serve as allies to both our Black colleagues and broader, marginalized communities—that we, as an Asian American community, stand by them in these difficult times. What are the most important findings you hope readers take away? Emily: First, that the notion of Asian Americans as a “model minority” is really a fallacy—the cohort has the highest level of income equality within the U.S., and socioeconomic mobility is incredibly difficult for some Asian Americans. And second, that it’s not enough to recognize these disparities, but not act—it’s critical we build inclusion and diversity into operating models, strategy, and our goals as business leaders. Harrison: I’d also add the takeaway that the Asian-American community is not a monolith. There is a tremendous amount of diversity within this cohort, which makes it very difficult to make a blanket statement for the group. For example, there's a vast difference from which countries Asian Americans come from, to the languages they speak, to their education and income levels. COVID-19 and advancing Asian American recovery You’re both leaders of ‘Asians at McKinsey.’ What has being a part of this group at the firm been like, particularly during a challenging time like COVID-19? Harrison: When COVID-19 forced many of us into remote work and life, we launched a new initiative to form mini-communities of 10 to12 members across all tenures and career tracks to openly discuss their experiences during these times. These conversations have really stayed with me. In one discussion, I heard from a U.S.-based colleague with elderly parents currently living in Asia. With the travel restrictions and border closures, she was afraid she would not be able to be there for her parents in case of emergencies and other potential health concerns. Emily: It's been really inspiring and also sobering to have several of our members of ‘Asians at McKinsey’ come together in these small-group discussions. In one of the first discussions we had, I shared an anecdote about my mother, who is Chinese American, who had gone to her Tai chi class and was asked to leave by her instructor, who said: ""You're making me sick. Get out of here."" As a first-generation immigrant, she didn't even tell me about this situation until two weeks later, and my reaction was outrage. When I shared this personal journey with our AAM community, I was completely blown away by the outpour of not only sympathy and empathy, but action. People galvanized around the need to educate, to build awareness, to do outreach. Never miss a story"

Photo by Manon Girault. August 12, 2020 Throughout the pandemic, we've been talking about how COVID-19 will transform the future of business at large, as well as industries from food , insurance , and hospital care to parcel delivery and packaging . Now, we are expanding that conversation by serving as the presenting partner of CNBC’s new franchise, “Our New Future.” The series explores the lasting effects of COVID-19 and the new business landscape it presents. A core piece of the partnership for us is the ability to share insights on five areas of opportunity we believe are critical for leading in The Next Normal : digital, transformation, organization, resilience, and sustainability. The partnership kicked off this week with the first of these topics—digital—as Kate Smaje , a senior partner who co-leads McKinsey Digital , explained how COVID-19 has been the greatest impetus for behavioral change in our lifetime. We spoke to Kate about why businesses must act faster than ever before, creating the cultural shifts required to enable truly digital organizations, and her work leading digital transformations—for clients and our firm alike. How six companies are using technology and data to transform themselves Why is digital absolutely critical for business leaders to understand on the path to The Next Normal? Kate: It’s really hard to join any company board meeting right now and not talk about how important technology is—as both an opportunity and a threat—in reshaping their business system. The impact of COVID-19 has only made this more relevant as companies have surged in serving their customers (whether B2B or B2C) through digital channels and undergone their own massive, overnight experiment in agile, and remote ways of working. Leaders have to make high-stakes decisions fast to ensure the resilience of their operations as these shifts have happened, so the importance of good, accessible data has never been higher.  It’s hard to believe the way for businesses to come out of this stronger is to revert back on all of this, so digital, technology, data are only going to become more important. COVID-19 has only made digital more relevant as companies...have undergone their own massive, overnight experiment in agile, and remote ways of working. You note our research finds one or two companies in each sector are significantly outpacing competitors. Why is that the case? Kate: Digital business models often bring together huge volumes of customer data to get momentum going.  They are able to tempt customers earlier with a great experience, then learn more and faster about what customers really want to make it better, and then use that information to identify looming threats and the best partners in defending value chains under digital pressure.  It’s a virtuous cycle and hard to break. Take, for example, how you buy your groceries digitally: once you’ve done it a couple of times with one brand—you’ve saved your shopping lists and set up your credit card—it’s hard to imagine why you’d go somewhere else, unless someone is paying you to do so through a discount voucher or another incentive. So if a digital business has managed to lock in a great customer experience from the start, it snowballs. What are telltale signs that an organization is ready for a digital transformation? Kate: I’ll give you some questions I’d ask the CEO. First, can they see an opportunity to create more value in their industry than the way in which they currently do—or are they perhaps concerned someone is going to do that to them? Second, are they on a digital journey where some things are going well, but nothing is really scaling, or in other words, are they in pilot purgatory? This is a common sign that they may have already started a digital transformation by name, but are not really transforming the core of the company so need to reset. Similarly, is the digital team doing really great work, but facing organ rejection in the rest of the company because you haven’t made the cultural shift required to become a digital-enabled organization? A final point: if you as a CEO are constantly hearing, “We couldn't do X because of IT,” it means you haven’t managed to modernize the way technology architecture and teams work in your organization. If you as a CEO are constantly hearing, 'We couldn't do X because of IT,' it means you haven’t managed to modernize the way technology architecture and teams work in your organization. What advice do you give to CEOs to drive that cultural shift you’re talking about? Kate: As a CEO you have to have a laser focus on where the value is going to be created in your industry; not necessarily how it’s created today, but how that’s going to shift over time. Once you have that north star vision, you have to be able to tell that story and genuinely excite your team. The minute I hear a CEO say, “I have to convince my organization,” something’s wrong. You don’t need to convince them—you have to excite them and then empower them to do things differently. Then, you’ve got to figure out how to rewire the way your organization works so it can make better decisions faster. And keep in mind: there are always going to be naysayers who don’t believe in digital or that it’s going to make your organization better. You can spend a majority of your time changing their minds. But I’ve found that if you can find the little fires of excitement burning elsewhere, it’s more effective to find a way to help them burn brighter, whether through funding or resources, or frankly, confidence. Some of the naysayers will come along, and others never will—and that’s okay, too. You’ve not only led digital transformations for clients, but for our firm. Tell us about that experience and your journey at McKinsey. Kate: I started my career at an investment bank before I came to the firm in the heart of the tech bubble. We used to have lunch and learns at the bank, and one day, I was listening to a colleague talk about their recapitalization work with a cable company. As a throw away comment, he mentioned McKinsey was there looking at how the business was going to grow again. And I thought, ‘Well that sounds more interesting than what we do.’ So I sent off a CV and the rest is history. Learning about how businesses work was infectious. Early on, I worked with retail clients just as digital was really transforming e-commerce. Later on, as a partner, I was seconded as a chief digital officer for a consumer client that was embarking on an end-to-end digital transformation, and I helped them think through the people they needed to hire, the technology they needed to build, and the processes they needed to change as a part of that journey. When I came back to McKinsey, our former global managing partner Dominic Barton asked me to do the same for the firm and lead our fantastic internal technology and digital teams—to think about what it would mean to serve clients in five to ten years’ time and how technology would be at the heart of that change, rethink our own data and technology architecture to better match our colleagues’ expertise and knowledge to client challenges, and create a happier and healthier colleague experience through technology.

In 2019, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that almost 40 percent of Americans are in occupational categories that could shrink by 2030. American workers without a college degree are also four times more likely than those with one to lose their jobs due to automation. The recent pandemic has only exacerbated this shift. As many as 57 million U.S. jobs are at risk because of COVID-19, and the most vulnerable Americans bear the brunt. Millions will need support shifting into new jobs and careers, building on the skills they have—ideally in a way that improves their economic prospects. To help connect and guide jobseekers to the support they need, McKinsey has joined the Rework America Alliance formed by the Markle Foundation , a non-profit organization focused on finding solutions for economic security and health for all Americans. The Alliance will help millions of workers, regardless of formal education, move into good jobs in the digital economy by accelerating the development of a more effective system of worker training aligned to jobs that employers will need to fill. By joining this Alliance, we can help create greater visibility for workers into what opportunities exist and how they can pursue them. While there is a rich and growing reskilling ecosystem, it can be hard to help workers navigate it: understanding what the in-demand jobs will be, pinpointing the reskilling opportunities that will most help, choosing and accessing the training options that build the right skills and will have traction with employers, and getting all that insight in a way that is tailored to the individual. “There is plenty of data out there on reskilling options,” says Nikhil Patel , a McKinsey partner. “But it exists in a patchwork, telling workers different and sometimes conflicting stories. There’s an opportunity to give workers more cohesive support at a national scale.” The Rework America Alliance members also include a mix of private, public, and social sector institutions, including the African American Mayors Association, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Google, Goodwill, Microsoft, the NAACP, the National Urban League, and Walmart, among others, that will collaborate to help enable unemployed workers to move to better jobs, regardless of formal education. “The need for reskilling has never been more acute,” says Liz Hilton Segel , managing partner for McKinsey in North America. “By joining this Alliance, we can help create greater visibility for workers into what opportunities exist and how they can pursue them.” As part of McKinsey’s support for the Rework America Alliance, we helped the Markle Foundation design a backbone of capabilities that enables participants in the reskilling ecosystem to better collaborate at scale—linking market signals, actionable insights on reskilling opportunities, and training options that will help workers better access those opportunities. As the Alliance’s work proceeds, McKinsey’s data analytics capabilities will help identify credible job trajectories for workers to improve their wages and job security based on their skills. We will also analyze potential future growth and viability of different job trajectories, and provide a factual anchor for discussion with employers and local community groups about near-term and long-term job demand. “It takes the guesswork out of this process for workers,” says Liz. “The goal is for jobseekers to be able to make fact-driven decisions on where to invest their time and select and access training options that will meaningfully help.” As a starting point, our team analyzed the recent experiences of workers across 60 million talent profiles and more than 150 million job postings. They looked at the real experiences of real people who moved successfully along a trajectory of low-wage or lower-middle-wage ‘origin’ jobs at high risk of displacement; to ‘gateway’ jobs proven to serve as a stepping stone to higher wages; to middle-to-high wage ‘destination’ roles  that are expected to be in demand, resilient to automation and COVID-19 disruption and accessible to skilled workers without four-year degrees. Initial analysis suggests that these proven trajectories will be relevant to a large subset of the 16 million Americans currently unemployed and the 57 million Americans at risk. They have a real chance of reaching an attractive occupation through reskilling. “No one knows exactly which jobs will recover when,” says Nikhil. “But reskilling clearly matters, and we should act now. Through the Alliance, we feel tremendous hope being able to help vulnerable workers access opportunities that could improve their incomes and safeguard their futures.” related In Italy and beyond, Generation upskills thousands of healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19 Never miss a story"
&ldquo;We felt like the blast happened in our own homes and backyards.&rsquo;&rsquo;,A colleague&rsquo;s personal account of the tragedy in Beirut and our local grassroots effort to respond.,2020-08-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/lebanon/new%20beirut%20hero%201536x864.jpg,"Our People,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/in-beirut-helping-those-affected-by-tragedy,"“We felt like the blast happened in our own homes and backyards.’’ More than 60 colleagues in Lebanon mobilized to feed thousands of people in Beirut after the August 4 explosion. August 14, 2020 I was with my wife in the mountains of Lebanon, 40 kilometers from Beirut, when the explosion happened. The moment we found out, we rushed to Mar Mikhael, the neighborhood adjacent to the Beirut Port. One of my family members had been injured in the blast, and when we arrived, she was still covered in glass. It left her cut and bruised, but thankfully that was the extent of her injuries. The rest of my family, friends, and the more than 60 McKinsey colleagues who were in Lebanon that day are all safe, but many were not as lucky. The devastating August 4 explosion that killed hundreds and injured thousands punched a hole in the earth and our hearts. All of us, everyone in the country and in the Lebanese community around the world, have been impacted in some way. Anyone who was in Beirut at the time, no matter where they were, was shaken to their core. “We felt like the blast happened in our own homes and backyards,’’ said Sabine El Najjar, one colleague I spoke to. Almost every firm member in the city—from senior partners to our newest colleagues—joined the effort. As the firm mobilized support for the Lebanese Red Cross’s relief efforts, the dozens of us on the ground in Beirut quickly connected to figure out what we could do to help right away. We started at the individual level in our communities, working with our neighbors to clean streets or help survivors sift through shattered homes. Those who could supported medical relief efforts. All the while, our colleagues came together to figure out what we could do collectively to help. We decided to provide food to those whose kitchens and food supply had been destroyed. Almost every firm member in the city—from senior partners to our newest colleagues—joined the effort. As a group, we sought to deliver 5,000 food boxes to 5,000 families in need. A friend offered his vacant house in Beirut, undamaged by the blast, to serve as a warehouse for the food supplies and a base for our operations, while another colleague deployed his father’s company vans to transport packages. Rima Assi , a senior partner who grew up in Lebanon, brought her young son and daughter along to support our relief efforts. “Seeing our colleagues organize so quickly to help the people of Beirut was truly inspiring,” she said. “It was a very touching moment to see how much my son wanted to make sure that what we were preparing actually reached people in need. And when we arrived to deliver the packages, it was also a difficult moment to see families in despair, rally around our truck to get their share. But when I looked around and saw the number of volunteers helping, it really gave me hope and made me feel very proud.’’ Thus far, we have assembled and delivered 1,500 packages and are determined to continue until we reach our goal. We deeply appreciate the support of our colleagues, their friends and families, and of complete strangers too. As a Lebanese community, it was extremely heart-warming in a time of tragedy to see the way our firm and our colleagues around the globe also lent their support to the critical work of the Lebanese Red Cross through donations and individual contributions. We recognize that delivering these care packages and our donations are just a small part of what’s needed to support the scale of this humanitarian crisis. Longer-term support will be necessary to help our beloved Beirut rise again. And we’re committed to doing whatever we can for that to happen. Never miss a story"

This seismic shift was the impetus for our Future of Asia research series on what expanding growth and opportunity in the region means for governments and businesses around the world. McKinsey Publishing wins four Platinum Hermes Awards for COVID-19 Insights In addition to the awards our Future of Asia campaign received, four Publishing pieces were also recognized with four Platinum Awards, the first in our firm's history. Safeguarding our lives and our livelihoods: The imperative of our time COVID-19: Investing in Black lives and livelihoods COVID-19’s effect on minority-owned small businesses in the United States Returning to resilience: COVID-19’s effects on mental health and substance abuse “Between Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore—I’ve been working in Asia for over 17 years,” says Oliver Tonby , chairman of McKinsey’s offices in Asia. “It's an area of real global business growth.” Oliver explains that while its economies have been expanding beyond the rest of the world combined and leading in trade, capital, talent, and innovation, the region’s growth story had not been extensively told until our research series. “Growth and opportunity in Asia have significantly advanced human development—from longer life spans and greater literacy to a surge in internet adoption,” says Wonsik Choi , managing partner of the McKinsey Korea office. Wonsik and Oliver partnered with the McKinsey Global Institute to develop the Future of Asia research across several modules. The topics include areas where Asia has undergone monumental shifts: trade and network flows, Asian corporations, technology and digital, the Asian consumer, and climate risk response. A year into our research, the Future of Asia series has earned seven global Hermes Creative Awards—one of the oldest and largest creative competitions in the world that recognizes the creative industry’s best publications, branding collateral, websites, videos, advertising, marketing, and communication programs. Two videos, Can Asia define the post-pandemic next normal? and The Future of Asia is now , received Platinum Awards, Hermes’s highest recognition. The latest module of the campaign, which was released last week, looks at how climate risk could play out in Asia and what measures can be taken to manage that risk. Our analysis finds that the socioeconomic impacts from intensifying climate hazards could in many cases be more severe for Asia than for other parts of the world if gone unchecked. Like other regions, Asia’s growth will be shaped by the coronavirus crisis. “Many countries in Asia have been successful with containment and mitigation efforts,"" says Oliver, ""with much of the early innovations having come from the region, such as contact tracing apps, wearables, and testing facilities."" Wonsik adds that Asia is generally resilient to disruption. “In an increasingly volatile world, Asian companies have demonstrated dynamism, speed, and agility, which have all contributed to the region’s macroeconomic stability and ability to pivot quickly in times of crisis.” Patti Wang , a Chinese-Canadian engagement manager who moved to Shanghai while conducting the initial phases of research, also points to the boom in the number of developing Asian countries leapfrogging into middle-income and advanced economies. For example, when most people think of manufacturing leaders, they think of Chinese cities; but there are others—like Jamnagar, India—that are quickly becoming contenders. This is reflected in the region’s ongoing industrialization and urbanization, rising demand and productivity growth, and dynamic corporate sector. Patti explains how the campaign has opened up numerous conversations with clients over the last year who are rethinking where and how they want to invest. “ ‘ In what areas is Asia underinvested? ’ is what people want to know,” she says. “Knowledge-intensive sectors, like pharmaceuticals and tech, are some examples.” Wonsik adds: “Our aspiration for the Future of Asia is to inform the ways in which public and private sectors think about the region as it continues its rapid evolution.” Never miss a story"

Three years in the works, it details the many ways that new innovations in the biological sciences, when combined with advances in computing and AI, can change the way we live. MGI is devoted to providing facts that contribute to decision making on critical management and policy issues that shape lives and livelihoods. Bio innovation will revolutionize what we eat and wear, the fuels we use, and how we construct our physical world. As much as 60 percent of the physical inputs or materials that contribute to the world economy could be produced biologically, and 45 percent of the global burden of disease could be addressed. In fact, the bio revolution is already helping us fight COVID-19—never in history has a virus been sequenced so rapidly. The Bio Revolution outlines this tremendous potential across four areas: biomolecules—the mapping, measuring, and engineering of molecules; biosystems—the engineering of cells, tissues, and organs; biomachines—the interface between biology and machines; and biocomputing—the use of cells or molecules such as DNA for computation. The report also covers the field’s substantial risks, legal and ethical issues, and the significant complexities inherent in adapting the innovations. All of this is illustrated through 400 use cases, most of which are scientifically viable today. Here, the researchers who assembled them introduce themselves and share their favorites. Miracle cure in a single shot Donna Xia, Associate PhD in Biological and Biomedical Sciences specializing in cancer biology I helped authenticate the 400-plus use cases. I’m especially excited about gene therapies that cure monogenic diseases: those caused by a single gene. In layman's terms, this therapy replaces a faulty gene in your body, and with a single treatment, can completely cure a person. There’s now a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare devastating disorder that is a leading cause of infant mortality. Now trial data from a drug called Zolgensma shows that around 90 percent of the children who received the treatment survived 14 months with much better motor control. Zolgensma is the most expensive drug ever approved at $2 million a dose. That has to change, but there is no doubt that gene therapy is going to transform many lives. (Note: You can read more about this innovation on pages 52 and 102 of the report.) Curing disease before it happens Archana Maganti, Associate Practicing doctor in India with a business degree I analyzed use cases in health and human services. The application that stood out for me was the use of gene therapy before or after conception. If offers the possibility of curing up to some 10,000 monogenic diseases before they even occur. Of course there are significant ethical questions that are far from being resolved with this technology, but as a doctor this fascinates me. Supersizing plants’ ability to consume CO 2 Travers Nisbet, Engagement Manager A business degree, with expertise in the economic impact of technology innovations I joined the project in the final phase, helping with everything from pressure-testing research to synthesizing key findings and getting the report launched. One use case that excites me is the Salk Institute’s Harnessing Plant Initiative , which could be a big step forward for sustainability. Plants are genetically engineered to have deeper and more extensive root systems so they can capture and store more CO 2 . The illustrative math suggests that converting roughly five percent of the world’s cropland to genetically engineered plants could enable us to capture approximately the same amount of CO 2 created by all airline emissions in a year. The science is nascent, there is a ton of work to get it out of the lab, create the seeds, and make it commercially viable with farmers, but the potential impact would be significant. (Note: You can read more about this innovation on page 136 of the report.) Life on Mars Alice Zheng, Engagement Manager A physician with an MBA and experience working in public health, pharma, and health services I joined the research early on helping to define scope and research methodologies, identify emerging trends, and measure the economic opportunities created by bio innovation. As a physician, health-related applications were top of mind, but I was most fascinated by use cases at the frontier of discovery—things I had never thought about. My favorite is the idea that you can “terraform” a planet, making it more Earth-like and therefore more habitable for humans.    Microbes could be genetically engineered to consume carbon monoxide as energy, or to engineer organisms to construct habitats—say on Mars—more efficiently, like mushrooms to secrete bioplastics. The idea of space colonization and the role of the biological revolution is very far into the future, but it captures the imagination of this research. (Note: You can read more about this innovation on page 140 of the report.) Restoring sight to the blind Kevin Hwang, Senior Business Analyst Business analyst with expertise in molecular biology I focused on biomachines and biocomputing applications, new technologies that link analytics and digital devices to biological systems. The retinal implant offers tremendous promise. In the case of a person experiencing blindness due to optic-nerve damage, a microelectrode array can serve as a bridge that bypasses dead tissue and communicates with the optic nerve in the brain. SecondSight’s retinal implant has enabled clinically blind patients to distinguish shapes, sense light, and even read print. As researchers advance ways to transmit these signals from the neuroprosthetic to the brain, partially blind or blind patients could see again with more and more detail as time goes on. (Note: You can read more about this innovation on page 146 of the report.) Vegetarians go mainstream Anneke Maxi Pethö-Schramm, Fellow Senior Associate A business degree, with expertise in digital innovation I helped to define the scope and methodology for sizing the economic impact of the use cases and then focused on the consumer and agriculture domains. As a vegetarian, I hope that innovation in alternative proteins could change what we eat in the future.  New fermentation processes, for example, enable the production of dairy proteins without the cow that are identical in taste and nutrition to animal proteins. This can reduce the negative impact on the environment and animal welfare. Ten years from now, we might also find lab-grown meat right next to traditional meat products in the supermarket. It’s a powerful way to change the way we think about food. (Note: You can read more about this innovation on page 115 of the report.) Bio-degradable plastics George Wang, Senior Business Analyst A degree in computational biology, working with biotech, pharma, and digital health companies Early on, I helped define the viability and scope of the research and later, oversaw the launch of the report and initial outreach. I am very excited about the impact that biology can have on the materials category and manufacturing as a whole. Biology-based production can make many processes much more sustainable. Consider the use of a bio-polymer – engineered yeast – instead of petroleum to create plastic products. Or squalene, a common ingredient in moisturizers that comes from the liver of deep-sea sharks, but is now being manufactured by fermenting sugar cane with genetically engineered yeast. Beauty products could become completely plant-based and sustainable, critical traits for a growing number of consumers. related The benefits of investing in better health: Insights from our new study Never miss a story"
Six digital trends gaining momentum&mdash;and why they matter,"Our McKinsey Digital team on the advances most accelerated amid the pandemic, including better virtual business relationships, smarter disease monitoring, and more.",2020-08-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/six%20colleagues%20on%20the%20digital%20trend%20that%20excites%20them%20most/digitaltrends-hero-full-1254705025-1536x864.jpg,Digital,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/six-colleagues-on-the-digital-trend-that-excites-them-most,"Six digital trends gaining momentum—and why they matter August 31, 2020 COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of digital technology . We caught up with a few of our colleagues to find out where they're seeing the most notable changes. 1. Broader—and better—virtual connections Rodney Zemmel , senior partner and global co-leader of McKinsey Digital, New York Before COVID-19, we saw huge adoption of digital in B2C organizations but less so in B2B selling. The conventional wisdom had been that in B2C, there’s only one customer who’s making the buying decision and the journey is pretty straightforward. B2B selling, meanwhile, required a longer, more complex buying-decision process that benefited from the value of relationships and an in-person sales process. But with the rise of video-conference and related digital platforms over the last few months, we’ve seen that digital is just as effective for B2B selling. We’ve found that B2B customers are happy to receive information virtually—especially when that information is supported by advanced analytics, which can give the customer even more insights into what their organization needs—and when they need it. Another example I’m excited about is the rise of virtual health. Remote healthcare isn’t new, but it had been pretty niche prior to COVID-19. But with the confluence of technology developments, changes in customer behavior, and changing regulations—from the practice of medicine across state lines to how healthcare gets paid for—virtual health has enormous potential to increase healthcare access for people. Capturing the value of digital 2. Smarter ways to assess—and address—risk Jan Shelly Brown , associate partner, New Jersey I work with clients on large agile and digital transformations. These have accelerated since the pandemic, and I’ve been excited by the ways digital can improve how we manage risk and compliance, particularly in more regulated industries such as banking and insurance. In banking in particular, we find that most organizations are still using legacy, check-the-box risk and compliance tools to assess the risk of a new product or feature. We have a digital tool called Agile Risk Watchtower , which offers an approach to manage risk in the context of your product. For example, if you’re a bank developing a mobile app, and your user needs to update personal information, the tool helps you manage—as you’re building out that feature—the potential risk concerns and suggested ways to mitigate them. All of these risks and steps to mitigate are cataloged for teams to see, adding transparency and eliminating the need for disparate discussions or delays in simply having to relay the information from one team to the next. 3. The rise and rise of e-commerce Anand Swaminathan , senior partner and leader of McKinsey Digital Asia, Singapore The biggest digital trend I have seen of late in my client work is the shift to buying everything online. I see it in my personal life, too. Just a few years ago, my family and I would purchase about half of everything we needed from an online channel. Today, it’s more like 95 percent. That’s a huge shift, and it’s playing out in how we search for products, how many different e-commerce services and retailers we use, and how we have shifted our loyalty from certain retailers to others who have better selection, better pricing, better search, and better payment experience. This is a trend that is likely here to stay for a long time—and will have tremendous impact on everything from product design and offerings, supply chains, or the creation of digital-only businesses. 4. More effective outbreak tracking Jessica Lamb , partner, Philadelphia I’m really inspired by the impact of digital on simulation models. This type of model has been around for decades to model disease epidemiology, but digital capabilities have enabled us to bring in larger volumes of data and substantially more compute power, so we can model even more scenarios in a faster way than ever before. For example, we can now have a disease simulation model that’s able to include new data inputs from almost every country, sometimes at the region or county level, that updates every week. Thanks to digital technology, these models are easily sent to the right stakeholders simultaneously, so that everyone benefits from the research in a way that’s applicable to them. Together, these capabilities allow us to give clients more scenarios to inform the tough decisions they have to make. 5. Better customer experiences Gabriela Platinetty , expert associate partner, Sao Paulo We’ve seen a rise in the number of brands using social messaging apps as a channel for conversational marketing, or a personalized version of chatbot communication, in large part because of how COVID-19 forced people around the world to shelter in place. Increasingly, these apps are a place for brands to have one-to-one conversations in real-time with their customers via direct messaging. I am very surprised by how fast marketers have adopted these apps for business—and by how quickly customers are able to solve challenges on them. During the pandemic, I was able to see a doctor, get groceries, and do several other tasks over an app, and have questions answered online. I think we’ll see more and more everyday experiences move online, which could allow more people access to these—and faster. 6. More ethical AI models Chris Anagnostopoulos , senior principal scientist, QuantumBlack, London Today, data science and AI models are being used to make decisions that have long-lasting impact on people’s lives, ranging from university admissions and loan approvals to medical decision-support. We need to ensure that AI systems follow ethical guidelines that serve to anticipate, and minimize, potential harm . This manifests itself along several dimensions—prominent among which are the right to privacy and the duty not to discriminate based on attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation or religion. Given the market’s voracious appetite for AI-powered products and services within a booming digital technology, we see a huge need for investment in a multi-disciplinary approach to fairness-aware, privacy-respecting, explainable and responsible AI—one where ethical considerations are treated as design principles, rather than afterthoughts. The time is now to develop technology, best practices, and the right culture to ensure that the AI systems of tomorrow will catalyze societal transformations that are strongly aligned with well-defined human values. related Meet CausalNex, our new open-source library for causal reasoning and “what if” analysis Never miss a story"

In 2008, Doro launched Care IP®, the world’s first digital social alarm (a device that calls for help in urgent situations). When Doro began thinking about an update to the device, which had remained essentially unchanged for over a decade, they sought the help of McKinsey Design. “People are living longer than ever before, so the time is ripe for innovation in technologies that aid the elderly,” says Ulrika Vejbrink , a McKinsey associate design director. In fact, our research shows that retired and elderly populations are expected to grow by thirty percent in the next decade. Ulrika adds that this, along with a desire of people to age in place , means systems like Eliza are more needed than ever. Doro Eliza’s core feature is a single alarm button. When it ’ s pressed, the device calls a receiving center and connects with a full range of telecare sensors, like smoke detectors, that help ensure the right services are deployed to help the person in distress. “We sought a clean and minimalist design,” says Jan Puranen , a McKinsey associate design director, of Doro Eliza’s design. “Too much clutter and technology can make it hard to use or understand.” Meanwhile, on the aesthetic front, Jan explains that many seniors attach a certain stigma to having such an alarm in their home. To address this challenge, the team took inspiration from something more familiar to these users: an analog radio. “We needed something that expresses reliability and quality,” explains Kristian Eke , a McKinsey senior design engineer. A vertical structure with a stable base was chosen so the alarm could be placed in a discreet spot, like a narrow table or windowsill. How the alarm is used varies by person and market, depending on the types of users. “We had to think about adaptability and ensuring ease of use for varying dexterity levels,” says Ulrika. Acclaimed for its cutting-edge aesthetic, which earned it a 2020 iF Design Award , the Doro Eliza “truly raises the bar in the industry,” says Jan. “Using 4G and IP digital networks ensure the highest level of reliability, security and flexibility for users—for today and the future.” Never miss a story"

The Trinity Challenge , launched today, is a new initiative that aims to use data and analytics to learn from the global response to COVID-19 in order to build greater resilience against future global health emergencies. Convened by Dame Sally Davies, Master of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge and former Chief Medical Officer of England, the challenge will offer £10 million in funding to recognize and reward insights and innovations across areas including economics, behavioral sciences, and epidemiology. “There will be another COVID-19, the only question is whether we will learn the lessons of this pandemic or be doomed to repeat our mistakes again,” said Dame Sally. “The Trinity Challenge is a recognition by business, academia, and philanthropy of the need for new, breakthrough ideas and approaches to beat future pandemics.” McKinsey is one of the challenge’s 22 founding members . Spanning the private, public, and social sectors, these leading organizations—including Google, Optum, Imperial College London, HKUMed, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—are united by the common aim of using data and advanced analytics to create inclusive innovations and build a world that’s better prepared for health emergencies. COVID Response Center “At McKinsey, we bring a sense of the interconnectedness between the world of solving problems on the health side and what it means for the business community, along with a set of data, tools, and deep research and insight,” said our global managing partner Kevin Sneader . “I hope we’ll be able to bring those capabilities to the task at hand and do so in a way that is vital and brings to bear the power of very different approaches.” The Trinity Challenge seeks new and practical ideas that could protect health and economic systems from the threat of global health emergencies across three areas: identification, response, and recovery. Selected submissions will be granted access to people and resources from founding members to maximize their effectiveness. Perhaps most importantly, the challenge calls for these solutions in a robust and inclusive way. Submissions will be fielded globally through an open and accessible online portal, ensuring the best minds and most innovative ideas emerge from around the world. We know the society that emerges in the wake of COVID-19 will be different, and this is one small commitment our firm is making to ensure it’s also more resilient. “We know the society that emerges in the wake of COVID-19 will be different, and this is one small commitment our firm is making to ensure it’s also more resilient” said McKinsey senior partner Hemant Ahlawat . “We must draw lessons from the current pandemic response to avoid making the same mistakes 20, 50, or 100 years from now.” Those who would like to learn more or are interested in participating in The Trinity Challenge can visit https://thetrinitychallenge.org . Formal applications will open in early October. The submission period will close in January 2021. related Through a new alliance, helping millions of Americans access quality jobs A new AI-powered network is helping workers displaced by the coronavirus crisis Never miss a story"
Three ideas from our first Black Investor Professionals Forum,McKinsey recently held a discussion around increasing diversity within private equity.,2020-09-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/three%20ways%20to%20advance%20black%20investors%20careers/black-investor-forum-hero-small-splitscreen-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/three-ways-to-advance-black-investors-careers,"Three ideas from our first Black Investor Professionals Forum Our first Black Investor Professionals Forum drew 150 people for a virtual panel discussion on increasing diversity within private equity. September 16, 2020 Building a more inclusive economy and closing the racial wealth gap will require getting many more Black professionals into fields like investment. In our commitment to helping further the careers of Black investors working in private markets, our Private Equity and Principal Investors Practice convened its first Black Investor Professionals Forum, which drew 150 people in the sector for a virtual panel discussion on increasing diversity within private equity. The event—which featured our global managing partner Kevin Sneader, Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund Chief Investment Officer Angela Miller-May , CDPQ Head of Real Assets and Private Equity and CDPQ Infra President & CEO Macky Tall , and Connecticut State Treasurer Shawn Wooden —was open to professionals at all tenures in the industry. According to McKinsey partner and co-leader of the McKinsey Black Network Shelley Stewart , the forum hopes to “offer the next generation of Black financial leaders insights, advice, and a network of professionals like themselves with whom they can learn and connect.” Private equity has an outsized ability to shape the global business community, and increasingly, research is showing the benefits of allocating capital to funds run by managers from diverse backgrounds. “Last year in North America alone, over 3,000 private equity firms controlled $1.9 trillion of assets under management,” said Kevin Sneader during the event. “These firms own over 20,000 companies and employ approximately 9 million individuals—presenting an opportunity to narrow the existing gender and racial inequalities and set a standard that others can emulate.” Here, according to the event’s panelists, are three ways to advance diversity in investment. Diversity efforts must be proactive—and sustained across all levels of an organization The decision to increase diversity should come from the top down—think boards of endowments, foundations, and pension funds, for example, which can hire more diverse leaders to ensure they build and sustain a strong pipeline that advances diversity throughout the organization. “We need to tackle diversity from different angles—these are the managers of tomorrow, who need to get experience in sourcing deals and exiting,” said Angela Miller-May. “So far efforts in the industry have been reactive, not proactive. There has to be intention, and also accountability.” Private Equity & Principal Investors Check biases of perceived risks The panelists discussed the often perceived risk in investing with managers from minority backgrounds. “In my view, this is rooted in institutionalized bias and racism,” said Shawn Wooden. “We need to call it what it is.” Our research shows that the more diverse organizations are, the more they are likely to outperform their less diverse peers. For financial services companies, this could mean an additional $60 billion in revenue from Black customers each year if Black Americans reach wealth parity with white Americans. “The best investment teams are those able to say they have covered all angles in terms of their investment strategies and decisions,” said Macky Tall. “That requires diverse thinking. I always say that our true asset is not the billions of dollars we manage—it’s the people.” Use ‘onliness’ as a source of strength. Black investors may sometimes find they are the only person of color in the room. That may cause uncomfortable feelings of “ onliness ,” said Mr. Tall. He encouraged Black investors to “be confident” in the differentiated experience they bring. “You have competencies, skills, and a perspective to bring to the table,” he said. Ms. Miller-May echoed this sentiment. “There are always going to be people who expect less from you,” she said. “Focus on being yourself, overdelivering, and really dismiss the negative noise. Grow in your career and grow in your network. You never know where opportunities are going to come from.” related At our first Hispanic and Latino Economic Forum, leaders unite to focus on jobs New research highlights gap between race and earning power in the US: Meet the authors Never miss a story"
The quantified case for protecting the natural world,"Authors of our new report &ldquo;Valuing nature conservation&rdquo; explain how protecting nature can create jobs, improve health, and fight climate change.",2020-09-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/valuing%20nature%20conservation%20the%20business%20case/conservationherofullcol9361140521536x864.jpg,"Sustainability,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/valuing-nature-conservation-the-business-case,"The quantified case for protecting the natural world Focuses on natural capital and global nature conservation, and is a strategic thought partner to public, private, and social sector leaders in nature conservation. Brings broad sector and functional expertise to supported clients across strategy, operations, organization and transformation topics. September 22, 2020 Much of the global economy depends on nature. Natural areas protect our communities against major storms, floods, fires, and desertification. They help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and directly support economic activities as wide-ranging as agriculture, ecotourism, and pharmaceutical innovation. Yet the complexity of the world’s stock of natural assets makes these benefits hard to quantify, leading many to overlook nature as an investment opportunity. As a result, we’re woefully behind in our global efforts to protect nature. Conservation will always include difficult tradeoffs, but better methodologies to assess the value of conservation will improve resource allocation when decision makers face those tradeoffs. That’s why this week, we’re publishing a new report called Valuing Nature Conservation , in which we bring together geospatial methodologies and data sets to quantify the benefits of nature conservation in detail. As an anchor for our analysis, we use a global target proposed by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity : to protect 30 percent of the planet by 2030. But because tradeoffs are made at a local level, we used highly detailed, 5x5km geospatial analytics and assessed around 35,000 data layers in a six-million-pixel image of Earth. We developed six different scenarios to get to that 30 percent protected mark, each of which differed in the way they weighed opportunity costs or the interpretation of the 30 percent target as a national or regional target. Valuing nature conservation Here’s what we found. Protecting 30 percent of the planet could reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by 0.9 to 2.6 gigatons annually, through both avoided deforestation and natural regrowth. As we discussed in our recent article Climate math: What a 1.5-degree pathway would take , this range equals four to 12 percent of the annual CO 2 emissions reductions needed by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Conserving 30 percent of the planet would also create between 400,000 and 650,000 jobs in nature conservation itself and create or protect another 30 million jobs in two nature-dependent markets — ecotourism and sustainable fishing — safeguarding a total of $300 to $500 billion in annual GDP. Not only that, but conservation may play a role in preventing the next pandemic. The areas our scenarios prioritize for conservation have a 10 to 80 percent higher concentration of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission than areas not prioritized in our scenarios. If we protect these areas, we may help contain ecosystem fragmentation and practices that can transmit diseases to human populations. Perhaps most importantly, we find that achieving 30 percent conservation could have a significant impact on the very biodiversity that underpins these benefits. It would, for example, expand the protected habitat of species threatened with extinction by on average 2.2 to 2.8 times. That means more space for snow leopards, Philippine eagles, and giant ant eaters, along with a million other threatened species. Meanwhile, on the costs side, we project that the additional operating expenditure of expanded conservation would be $20 billion to $45 billion a year. Those are some of the global conclusions. Locally, we see a compelling business case emerging. We find that for over half the areas that we assessed, the GDP benefit created by ecotourism and sustainable fishing alone could outsize the operational costs of conservation by more than three times. We need to compile the natural business case at the decision maker level: province by province, reef by reef, forest by forest. We realize that this is only the tip of the business-case iceberg. There are countless downstream benefits of conservation that we were unable to quantify at a six-million-pixel scale, many of them related to climate change mitigation. For example, in our report Climate risk and response , we find that without a change of course, by 2030, between 160 million and 200 million people could live in regions with an average five percent annual probability of experiencing a heat wave that exceeds the survivability threshold for a healthy human being. Taking this forward, we need to compile the natural business case at the decision maker level: province by province, reef by reef, forest by forest. Our new report attempts to contribute to the methodology that would make this possible. What’s needed next is the collaboration of public and private stakeholders, conservation donors, practitioners, and scientists in alliances that can pool resources and expertise . These alliances, in our view, would work closely with government but also pull in private sector partners and their experience in areas like project financing and risk modelling. Such alliances have been very successful in public health, but largely absent in the conservation space. Our recommendations in the report include questions that conservation stakeholders can explore as they work together better to compile the natural business case — pixel by pixel, kilometer by kilometer — informing a more optimal allocation of economic resources to conservation. We hope that our insights and methodology will help inform critical conversations and decisions made by the global conservation community.

This year’s shortlisted authors include a Nobel Prize winner, a CEO, university professors, journalists, and an economist. The inspiration for one book came to authors during summer days at a cabin in Montana; another, from decades-old company records in the archives of MIT. “A good shortlist should include books that are provocative, well-written, with compelling character studies, ones that also offer lessons and remedies that inspire readers to reframe contemporary, essential issues,” said Raju Narisetti , McKinsey global publishing director and one of eight members of this year’s jury. “These six cover that gamut, but—more importantly for this extended pandemic moment in all our lives—they also stand the test of time, especially in the role business can and should play in how the next normal shapes up.” A judges panel will select a winner of the award and the £30,000 prize that will be presented in London on December 1; runners up will receive £10,000. Here’s a look at some of the most compelling business reading this year: No Filter: The inside story of Instagram By Sarah Frier This book traces the extraordinary rise of Instagram from a storytelling app to a cultural force that shapes the way we eat, entertain, dress and live, and along the way, created the new “influencer” industry. No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention By Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer In terms of culture, Netflix breaks a lot of rules. This book, co-authored by the media giant’s CEO, reveals how the company values, cultivates, and inspires its people in ways that have allowed it to lead one wave of innovation after another in the entertainment industry. If Then: How the Simulmatics Corporation Invented the Future By Jill Lepore This is the story of Simulmatics, a company that gathered data and used it to track and model behavior in everyday life, from buying a dishwasher to tracking social trends to influencing votes. It may sound like business-as-usual today—but it all took place in 1959. We know what you’re reading this summer Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism By Anne Case and Angus Deaton This book offers a clear-eyed, sobering look at the reasons why capitalism is failing our working class today—exemplified by rising rates of divorce, suicide, drug use—and offers tangible solutions for a way forward. Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire By Rebecca Henderson Businesses can solve the toughest issues we face today, including social and economic inequality and catastrophic climate change. That’s the argument this book makes—and supports, with examples of companies already creating positive change. A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond By Daniel Susskind Based on a decade of research, Daniel Susskind looks at how technology will reshape our worlds of work. It explores the implications of losing whole labor segments, the increase in economic inequality, and need for new government approaches. related “Invisible Women” wins the 2019 Business Book of the Year Award For your reading list: the 2019 Business Book of the Year shortlist Never miss a story"
Six sustainability priorities from our new climate change compendium,The COVID-19 crisis offers an unprecedented opportunity to bring environmental and economic priorities together. Here are six sustainability priorities from our research to help us get to The Next Normal.,2020-09-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/six%20sustainability%20priorities%20from%20our%20new%20climate%20change%20compendium/climatetrends-hero-full-1125840430-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/six-sustainability-priorities-to-focus-on-now-for-a-greener-future,"Six sustainability priorities from our new climate change compendium September 24, 2020 This week, McKinsey joined other organizations at Climate Week NYC to discuss ways we can recover from COVID-19 while simultaneously addressing environmental challenges. Ahead of the event, we released a compendium on climate change . Here are six sustainability priorities from our research that can help us on the path to The Next Normal . 1. Prioritizing a green COVID-19 recovery As our global managing partner Kevin Sneader recently told GZERO, “Coronavirus holds profound lessons that can help us address climate if we make greater economic and environmental resiliency core to the recovery.” The period after the pandemic will determine whether the world meets or misses the emissions goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which were set to limit global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. An estimated $10 trillion will be spent globally in recovering from COVID-19. Our research shows that a low-carbon recovery could not only significantly reduce emissions, but also create more jobs and economic growth than a high-carbon recovery would. In fact, our analysis of stimulus options for a European country suggests that mobilizing €75 billion to €150 billion of capital could yield €180 billion to €350 billion of gross value added, create up to three million new jobs, and enable a carbon-emissions reduction of 15 to 30 percent by 2030. 2. Allocating and reallocating capital Capital allocation and reallocation is the key to a green recovery. The good news is that global finance has already mobilized, and low interest rates mean that the cost of capital for sustainability investments has never been lower. Recently, the risk-reward equation for sustainability investments has flipped. Carbon intensive investments that used to be safe are now seen as risky, and the clean alternatives that were seen as risky are now seen as safe. For example mature energy technologies such as solar, wind, battery storage, and electric vehicles no longer need subsidies to be affordable and, for some, costs continue to decline. In addition, well-functioning voluntary carbon markets—in which private investors, governments, non-governmental organizations, and businesses can voluntarily purchase carbon offsets for their emissions—will be critical to reaching net zero and net negative goals. In conversations and announcements during Climate Week NYC this week, we see that the demand for these markets is significant, which will require the buildup of supply for carbon offsets and robust mechanisms for their certification and verification. 3. Adapting to existing physical risk The physical impact of rising global temperatures is already presenting challenges to communities around the world. As Earth’s climate gets warmer, acute hazards such as heat waves and floods grow in frequency and severity, while chronic dangers such as drought and rising sea levels intensify. Not only could climate change create inequality—simultaneously benefiting some regions while hurting others —within regions, the poorest communities and populations are typically the most vulnerable to climate events. According to research from the McKinsey Global Institute , these physical risks from climate change will also translate into increased socioeconomic risk, raising new questions for business leaders and policymakers alike. For example, long-accepted engineering parameters for infrastructure design may need to be rethought; homeowners and banks may need to adjust assumptions about long-term mortgages. 4. Accelerating decarbonization The power sector was undergoing a global transformation before the pandemic, as lower costs made renewables competitive with conventional fuels. As COVID-19 has created greater urgency to address climate change, accelerating decarbonization across sectors could reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions required to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Our report shows the fashion industry, for example, was responsible for some 2.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in 2018, about 4 percent of the global total—and about the same quantity of GHGs per year as the entire economies of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined. Fashion manufacturers and fiber producers could significantly reduce their emissions by decarbonizing material production and processing, minimizing production and manufacturing waste, and increasing use of sustainable transport and packaging, among other efforts. McKinsey on Climate Change 5. Protecting natural capital Natural capital provides critical services and resilience, from supporting water cycles and soil formation to absorbing CO 2 and protecting communities from storms, floods, fires, and desertification. But studies show human activity is eroding the value generated by natural capital: For example, deforestation is responsible for as much as 14 percent of global carbon emissions, accelerating climate change and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. Our research suggests that doubling nature conservation by 2030 could have a significant impact for both the environment and economy, including reduced atmospheric CO 2 by 0.9 gigatons to 2.6 gigatons annually, up to 650,000 new jobs in conservation-related fields, and lowered risks for new zoonotic diseases. 6. Transforming corporations at scale This week our firm joined other organizations at Climate Week NYC to discuss how we can all work together to accelerate climate action. As McKinsey senior partner and global leader of our Sustainability practice Dickon Pinner says, responding to climate change —and meeting the 2015 Paris Agreement goals—will require global corporations to transform at scale. “The magnitude of our climate challenge will require rapid action across every part of the economy,” he says. “What countries, businesses, and individuals do in the next decade will decide what world future generations will live in. Tackling climate risk won’t be easy, but it will be worth it to build a more prosperous, equitable, resilient, and sustainable world.” related The quantified case for protecting the natural world Never miss a story"

Do women have the same legal rights as men? How many women are CEOs or lead government agencies? These are three of the 15 indicators of gender equality that the McKinsey Global Institute used to create the Gender Parity Score , a feature of its ground-breaking research, the Power of Parity . The score tracks the progress countries have made to full parity, as measured by their score between 0 (perfect inequality) and 1 (perfect equality) and it reveals that progress globally is at a standstill: over the past five years, it has inched only .01 points ahead, from 0.60 in 2014 to 0.61 today. We recently spoke with the three leaders of the research— Anu Madgavkar , Kweilin Ellingrud, and Mekala Krishnan —about why gender advancement been so difficult, the impact of COVID-19 and the outlook. Why has progress towards gender equality been so elusive over the past five years? Anu: Gender equality is about attitudes that have been centuries in the making and are pervasive at the micro level in the home: the role of men and women.  These are large-scale systemic problems we are trying to fix. In the World Values Survey ,  more than half of respondents in South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa believe that when jobs are scarce, men should have the first right to a job and if women work for pay, children suffer. Even in developed countries those numbers were about 15 percent and 30 percent respectively. The challenge is: how do we unlearn this?  These attitudes then influence all aspects of life outside: in education, access to work, government services, and cultural behaviors. What advances have we seen? Kweilin: We have gone two steps forward, one step back I would say. In terms of the overall Global Parity Score, we’re almost exactly where we were five years ago.  But there are bright spots: a reduction in sex-specific abortions; education for girls in many developing countries is improving; and there have been bold initiatives to promote women—in corporate leadership and on boards of directors. Anu: The Middle East has improved in health and education. In fact, many countries have continued to close gender gaps in education, with more girls attending elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels. In many developing countries, women are outperforming men academically. For example, women earn 56 percent of college degrees in the United States and Australia. And in China, the Philippines, and Singapore, women earn 53 percent of college degrees. Mekala: We see a difference when we talk to private-sector companies, some of the biggest employers in the world. Gender equality is not just an HR issue but is now integral to their broader talent strategy, the diversity of their supply chain, and how they serve their customers. Ten things to know about gender equality How has the Me Too Movement influenced gender equality? Kweilin: Things that were either ignored or accepted 10 years ago are now unacceptable, such as sexual harassment in workplaces of any kind and hiring and firing on the basis of gender. We still have a long way to go, but it is encouraging that we are moving forward and cleaning things up, although unevenly. What has been COVID-19’s impact ? Anu: It has been a major setback. Women tend to hold the jobs that have been lost in the pandemic in fields like the service industry, hospitality, and retail—and they tend to stay out of work longer. It has disproportionately affected female entrepreneurs, especially in developing countries. Women have the double workload of child care, especially with schools closed or offering remote learning. And in the stress of tight quarters, the rate of domestic violence has increased. Even before the pandemic, 1 in 3 women around the world experienced violence from an intimate partner. Which two to three interventions are most important to reduce the setbacks of COVID-19? Anu: It is critical that women who are unemployed do not stay permanently out of work. One way to do this is to ensure that women get equal access to the many programs worldwide that have been created to support vulnerable households and small businesses. Mekala: Women disproportionately do unpaid work in the home: childcare, cooking and cleaning. I come from India where women do 10 times the amount of unpaid work that men do. If we can reduce and re-balance this workload, that will go a long way to helping women participate equally in the workforce. Has the pandemic had any positive impact on gender equality? Anu: Yes, the increase in flexible work schedules has disproportionately helped working mothers.  And  we have seen companies using the release of geographical constraints as an opportunity to diversify their organizations and expand the profiles of leaders they can bring in geographically, racially, and culturally. Kweilin : There has been a heartening advancement of women in politics and some countries led by women—Finland, New Zealand, and Germany, among others—have done significantly better than average in dealing with COVID-19. The world has noticed. Finally, how has our work as a firm helped to advance this critical issue? Anu: The Power of Parity research has been localized across multiple countries, and governments have used it to shape policies including female participation in the labor force, financial and digital access, and women’s entrepreneurship. Kweilin: We’ve also helped multilateral organizations and philanthropies develop programs to measure and track gender parity outcomes, shape global priorities and build internal capabilities. And we’ve worked with 150 plus companies to create more robust, diverse talent and leadership pipelines. related How are working women doing during COVID-19?

It’s a great question, and one I was excited to discuss with Financial Times US Business Editor, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, during the Financial Times’s Global Moral Money Summit . An inclusive economy is fundamental to building a next normal after the COVID-19 crisis where we can thrive. It means creating an economy that provides opportunities to underserved people and communities; creates resilient, higher-wage jobs for workers; and ensures the mental health needs of people are met, enabling more productivity, greater personal and professional fulfillment, and many other benefits. Businesses are facing a host of new challenges right now, and leaders in every industry have a full-slate of change on their agendas. But building an inclusive economy has never been more critical—and the time is now to embark on the journey. Here are three elements I shared with the FT that will help us along the way. Reskill and upskill In a recent McKinsey survey of 800 executives in nine countries, 85 percent said their businesses have somewhat or greatly accelerated digitization during the pandemic, and nearly two-thirds reported that their companies have accelerated automation and artificial intelligence. To ensure this transformation doesn’t leave vulnerable workers behind, organizations must identify the skills their recovery business model depends on, then develop and scale tailored resources and programs to close any skills gaps among their employees. These reskilling programs and workforce policies should be developed in partnership across departments and in tandem with industry leaders, business associations, educational, and social-sector institutions to build a better-prepared, resilient talent pipeline. For instance, McKinsey recently joined the Rework America Alliance , formed by the Markle Foundation. The initiative will help millions of workers, regardless of formal education, move into good jobs in the digital economy by accelerating the development of a system of worker training that is specifically aligned to jobs that employers will need to fill. McKinsey is working to translate analytics into targeted guidance on reskilling opportunities, leading to better wages and better quality jobs. Support mental health The rise of remote work means people are essentially “sleeping at the office.” More than half of Americans say the pandemic has negatively affected their mental health, and we know mental disorders can impact business performance, resulting in lower productivity, increased healthcare costs, and higher mortality. In these uncertain times, it is the responsibility of leaders to offer the support services employees need to be their best and to cultivate a workplace that creates a sense of belonging. We can begin by investing in training that equips leaders with the skills, language, and norms to support fellow colleagues who may be suffering. Companies can also provide access to mental-wellness resources, from self-help tools to high-quality treatment providers, all while being empathetic and flexible around the challenges that individuals are encountering in balancing their work lives with personal lives. Having a way to do a systematic temperature check of your workforce (via a pulse survey or similar mechanism) can help you better pinpoint which resources are needed most. Bridge the diversity and inclusion gap Lessons from previous crises tell us that there’s a very real risk that diversity and inclusion efforts could take a back seat in strategic priority during these challenging times. Although unintentional, I would affirm that these efforts are more critical than ever before, and it is incumbent on executives to remain vigilant in the pursuit of a diverse and equitable workforce. Research, including our own , consistently makes the case that strong business performance correlates to how diverse and inclusive a company is. Driving change and impact on this front requires a systematic, business-led approach and commitments need to be backed up by bold action. To do so, companies can focus on ensuring they have the right representation of diverse talent; enabling equality of opportunity through fairness and transparency; and promoting openness and tackling microaggressions. Driving enduring change will take time and commitment from all of us, but I’m hopeful that we can hold each other accountable. The unprecedented challenges we’ve faced in 2020 have raised awareness around some of the complex, systemic injustices and biases that have existed for too long in the world of work and society itself. These challenges aren’t new, but they’re part of the conversation now in a way they’ve never been before. Driving enduring change will take time and commitment from all of us, but I’m hopeful that we can hold each other accountable. I’m encouraged by the type of collaboration we’re seeing between the public, private, and social sector to solve some of these challenges, and I’m optimistic it will all contribute to a more inclusive economy. related Our North American leader talks work flexibility amid COVID-19 Never miss a story"
Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger,An inside look at the gravity-free electric vehicle charging system created by Hyundai and McKinsey Design.,2020-10-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20world%20first%20design%20for%20hyundais%20new%20car%20charger/hyundaiawards-hero-small-rendering-1536x864.jpg,"Design,Awards",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-world-first-design-for-hyundais-new-car-charger,"Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger October 7, 2020 While global auto sales have dropped overall during the pandemic, electric vehicles (EVs) have shown resiliency in some countries. Lower costs, government policies and regulations, and a lower carbon footprint are among the plausible reasons for this trend. Yet EV attractiveness is not without its hurdles, particularly when it comes to the charging experience. According to auto manufacturer Hyundai’s research, eight in ten EV owners are not satisfied with their current charger experience. Projected to be among the top ten EV manufacturers by 2025 , Hyundai therefore sought a revamp of its charging experience within the South Korean market. “A robust and user-friendly infrastructure required to charge electric vehicles is few and far between,” says Jeff Salazar , a McKinsey Design partner. “It’s rife with inconsistent charging port locations and cumbersome cables that force users to struggle to maneuver heavy and often unhygienic connectors.” Over six months, Hyundai’s Creative Works team and McKinsey Design worked together to reimagine a frictionless user experience. The result: the Hyundai Hi-Charger , which features a gravity-free charging system that moves the burden of heavy, unwieldy cables from the user to the station. Recognized for its bold vision, the design was recently named a 2020 Fast Company Innovation by Design honoree and Red Dot Award recipient. The Hi-Charger allows a user to drive up to the stall and, through an app or digital touch display, select the vehicle’s charging port position. From there, a connector automatically rotates and descends from a “halo” structure to the select point. “Our ambition was to make this completely effortless for the user, removing all constraints,” adds Young Jang , Hyundai Creative Works team leader. “As a company, we believe everyone should have equal access to a more sustainable future.” To arrive at this “halo” concept, the teams first conducted qualitative research to fully understand the complications EV users face each day. Among the researchers involved was McKinsey design director Sona Patadia-Rao , who interviewed EV owners in their homes as well as observed how they interacted with existing charging stations. “We’d ask them questions like how might they think about charging differently if given the opportunity to do so,” she says. To get a broad perspective across various use cases and driving behaviors, the teams chose participants both in the city in Seoul and in the nearby suburban area of Gyeonggi-do. They looked at users who owned EVs for various purposes, like commuting to work, seeing family, running errands, or leisure holidays. What they ultimately learned is there is no single user type. “When you approach a project that has no benchmark for what can be done, it’s our job as designers and engineers to push the boundaries of what’s possible but with an understanding of what’s feasible,” says Alexander Dakin, an associate design director at McKinsey. “It’s easy to assume early EV adopters are tech-driven people, but our research helped us see this wasn’t always the case,” says Sona. For example, many users value other types of benefits these cars bring, such as environmental factors, which are big influencers in their purchasing decisions. “Understanding these motivations has to translate into the design, which needs to address a whole range of users and their differing behaviors,” she adds. Once the research phase was completed and the pain points had been captured, the teams then began mocking up different ideas for charging stations all while considering the technical, manufacturing, and usability considerations.  “Experimentation was a major part of all of this—the design process is driven less by hypothesis and more by a build-test-learn methodology,” Jeff says. “This work was really about building the emotional connection between a brand and its consumers. This new type of charging system experience is a compelling manifestation of Hyundai’s ethos in a rapidly evolving era of EVs.” Just one year since launching in the South Korean market, the Hi-Charger has bridged the physical and digital experience of charging electric vehicles. “It’s completely shifting the paradigm for EV stations going forward,” Hyundai's Creative Works team says. “Innovating in ways that might make you uncomfortable or don’t feel feasible often leads to the most memorable work,” says Jeff. While users still have to physically charge the car, the Hi-Charger has alleviated a pain point in a way no one else has. “The question for us is always how can you make everyday intersections and processes as magical as possible,” says Jeff. “You do that by surprising people in unexpected ways that help them live as friction-free a life as possible.” Never miss a story"
"To celebrate National Coming Out Day, five McKinsey colleagues talk identity and inclusion",“Out” colleagues share their experiences and perspectives for how companies can make all employees feel comfortable to  be their true selves at work.,2020-10-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/national%20coming%20out%20day/comingoutday-hero-fullcol-5people-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/to-celebrate-national-coming-out-day-five-mckinsey-colleagues-talk-identity-and-inclusion,"To celebrate National Coming Out Day, five McKinsey colleagues talk identity and inclusion October 8, 2020 “Out” employees at America’s largest companies report meaningfully higher levels of happiness and career satisfaction. For example, LGBTQ+ women who are open about their sexuality at work are half as likely to leave their current employer in the next year compared with their closeted peers. Yet, progress is still needed. In a recent survey, we found that one in four LGBTQ+ respondents are not broadly out at work. In honor of National Coming Out Day this weekend, several McKinsey colleagues talk about their coming-out experiences—and their perspectives on how companies can make all employees feel safe to be their true selves at work. Pip Kindersley on the lonely ‘B’ After having come out as a lesbian to friends and family at the age of 14, Pip did what she calls “a reverse come-out” in medical school when she started dating men. Today, she identifies as bisexual—and describes how alienating this identity often feels. “There’s typically an assumption that if you’re a woman and affiliated with an LGBTQ+ network or group, your partner is female,” Pip says. “It can often feel like you don’t belong because bisexuals are a minority, and there is still a lack of awareness and knowledge about what that means.” She sees inclusion trainings as one way to overcome this misconception. “We need to give people the right words to understand and comfortably talk about different types of sexual orientations in conversations.” For Pip, being open about her sexuality has been a key way for her to spread knowledge. “I’ve found my openness has often resulted in others doing the same with me.” David DeLallo on being among the first When David joined McKinsey three years ago, he identified as a woman. Two years later, he began transitioning and turned to a few trusted colleagues, including his local HR contact, to discuss ideas about how he could come out to colleagues stationed all around the world. Shortly after making a few personal calls and sending rounds of emails to let colleagues know about his path, he recalls debating whether to attend a summer office party. “Even though I received a very positive response to my outreach, I was nervous about how colleagues would react,” David says. When he arrived at the event, there were name tags for attendees to wear. “I found my ‘David’ tag, put it on, and never felt I had to explain anything the rest of the evening.” As one of the first people to ever transition publicly while at McKinsey, David says the outpouring of support and encouragement he received from colleagues across the firm helped carry him through some of the more difficult parts of the process. “There’s often a lot more you have to think about as a transgender person,” he says. “At times, you tend to do more thinking than just being, which can feel really burdensome.” David sees having a network as a crucial part to coming out. “It doesn’t have to be the perfect fit—just two or three people to talk to is helpful. The more allies you can have to spread the message, the better.” Jaqueline Carey on intersectionality When Jacqueline told her parents she was dating a woman in college, she first wondered if she had an obligation to tell other people she was queer. “As a Black woman who was adopted at a young age, I’ve had a lot of explaining to do most of my life,” she says, “and I decided when it came to my sexuality, I wanted to have that same level of openness.” “Growing up, I didn’t have many—if any—role models who were queer and Black,” Jacqueline says. “I’ve felt a duty to share my story with people. I hope it gives others a sense of someone out there who looks like them whom they can relate to.” Prior to joining the firm, Jacqueline began sharing that story as an openly queer  R&B singer, who performed in Los Angeles and cast women as romantic leads in her music videos. By expressing her true self in such a public way, “it really boosted my confidence for when I entered the corporate world,” she says. “This is who I am, and I don’t want to hide it.” David Baboolall on allyship Two weeks into starting as a business analyst at McKinsey, David told a colleague and good friend that he was gay for the first time in his life. That colleague quickly brought over a member of Equal at McKinsey , McKinsey’s global network of LGBTQ+ colleagues. Within 10 minutes, David was surrounded by 15 Equal at McKinsey's member who stayed with him the entire weekend offering support, advice, and celebration. This pivotal experience changed everything for David and how he eventually came out to family, friends, and clients. He shares how being out has only elevated his client relationships and even led to some coming out to him. “Had it not been for two allies, the rest of my story never would have happened,” says David. “Within organizations, we need to help educate colleagues on how to welcome and uplift others who might identify in ways that are novel to them. An inclusive culture is on the basis of ensuring colleagues can be appropriate allies.” Carter Guensler on gender fluidity For Carter, coming out is a constant process. As someone who identifies as genderqueer , Carter says “the hardest part to navigate is the confusion over my pronouns,” which are They/Them/Theirs. One way Carter manages this is by including these pronouns in their email signature. “I’m hoping this will make it easier to introduce my identity earlier without needing to have an occasional conversation about it,” they say. While for some, spreading the word about their sexuality as widely as possible is their preference, others may choose for a less public coming out. Organizations play a critical role in fostering an environment of acceptance and comfort. Another factor that has emboldened Carter’s openness is recent acts of racial injustice throughout the U.S. In having conversations with Black friends and colleagues, “I’ve realized the importance of sharing my otherness,” they say. “The more exposure people have to different identities, the greater their understanding and acceptance.” Never miss a story"
Behind our work to support behavioral health amid COVID-19,Mental health and substance-use disorders have become more salient during the pandemic. Here&rsquo;s how we are supporting behavioral health for our society and people.,2020-10-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/behind%20our%20work%20to%20support%20behavioral%20health%20amid%20covid%2019/mentalhealthherofulcol12088835231536x864.jpg,"COVID-19,Healthcare,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/behind-our-work-to-support-behavioral-health-amid-covid-19,"Behind our work to support behavioral health amid COVID-19 October 9, 2020 Of the many ways COVID-19 is straining society, the rise of behavioral health challenges (i.e., mental and substance use disorders) has been among the most invisible so far. But according to McKinsey partner Erica Coe , that’s beginning to change. “More people are paying attention to mental health now amid the pandemic given spikes in drug overdoses, anxiety, depression, and insomnia,” she explains. Supporting mental health for our society Erica is a co-leader of our Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare . Launched last summer, the center was established to improve healthcare globally by working in areas that are highly valuable to society—such as mental health, substance use, social determinants of health, maternal health, and rural health—but not necessarily highly invested in. A core component of its work since launch and throughout the pandemic has been a partnership with the non-profit Shatterproof —which works to fight substance use disorder in the U.S. Our efforts with Shatterproof have focused on developing a national strategy to help reduce the stigma around opioid addiction, with the goal of ensuring that addiction is viewed and treated with the same urgency and compassion as other chronic conditions. “Addressing mental and substance-use disorders feels that much more critical now under COVID-19 given how ubiquitous the challenges are,” says Erica. “It impacts all ages and backgrounds, and with serious implications for life expectancy, physical health, and quality of life.” In addition to being a human tragedy across many fronts, COVID-19 is affecting nine out of ten employers across their workforce behavioral health and productivity. That impact can cost companies; for instance, the loss of productivity due to mental health conditions can be as high as $1 trillion per year . Making progress on this front won’t happen through one-off initiatives, Erica explains. “We're committed to sharing insights and results from the Center's projects in an external, open-access way, so others can replicate what proves effective” she says. “We know that to really move the needle across these issues that are so deeply relevant to society, we must collaborate around innovation.” One way the Center is enabling this kind of collaboration is through its open-access dashboard that highlights COVID-19’s impact on individuals with physical health, behavioral health, and social and economic vulnerability. Through analytics, the dashboard leverages data of insured individuals to identify where these populations are located and helps inform solutions to support them. By processing over 15 million American health claims, the dashboard can help identify geographic hotspots with relatively higher concentrations of people at greater risk for COVID-19—and the targeted interventions (e.g., behavioral health supports) to help them. For instance, one psychiatrist at a large health system used the tool to compare the state and county behavioral health demand with the supply of psychiatrists and psychologists and other mental health providers. With that information in hand, she was able to make a case for prioritizing additional hiring. Complementing the dashboard, the Center has launched an array of publications, podcasts and articles to shine a light on the many behavioral challenges exacerbated by COVID-19 and how organizations around the world can mitigate the outcomes on vulnerable populations. Helping fight stress for frontline workers through pro-bono work The need to manage stress and bolster emotional wellbeing during the pandemic is especially significant for at-risk groups, like frontline healthcare workers . To that end, leaders of Aberkyn , a McKinsey company of change facilitators, and our Middle East office partnered in May with the Abu Dhabi Authority for Social Contribution Ma’an to offer a series of pro-bono mindfulness coaching sessions and renewal workshops for Sheikh Khalifa Medical City staff. Thirty-two staff members received training through 90-minute sessions on how to build team resilience and deep connections with themselves and others to maintain relationships. Since then, Aberkyn has led multiple pro-bono virtual workshops for other healthcare clients both within the Middle East and globally. Healthcare workers at the very frontline of COVID-19 work under high stress conditions while providing care for patients. ""Offering these people an opportunity to step outside from their daily action and reflect, renew, and re-energize among colleagues makes a big difference,” say Aberkyn leaders Rawan Albina and Annette Kirby , who have been leading these mindfulness sessions for healthcare workers in the Middle East. Supporting mental health inside our firm According to Kana Enomoto —a senior expert at McKinsey who specializes in behavioral health —more and more companies are prioritizing investments in employees’ mental and emotional wellbeing. “Mental health is an important dimension of diversity and inclusion.  It’s crucial to financial survival and to future-proof businesses for the next generation,” she says. Our firm is among them. In addition to a variety of flexible work options, a firmwide program called Mind Matters, launched in 2019, provides 24/7 intervention support in multiple languages and increases awareness around mental health and substance use issues for all 30,000 firm members. What started as just a few offices with their own initiatives, speakers, and events has quickly expanded to a global effort. Today, there are trained mental health points of contact in all of McKinsey’s 150-plus locations who are able to direct colleagues to the best available resources. The program has perhaps never been more impactful than now. Sofi Ureña , a senior trainer, used the program to help address challenges she was experiencing because of isolation during quarantine. “I was surprised by how safe and at ease I felt on the phone,” she says. After two calls, Sofi says she’s gotten into the practice of writing her feelings down on paper to help identify what triggers a panic attack and is better able to communicate emotions with her husband and therapist. And for Feifei Sun , an executive editor now based in Atlanta, travel bans meant she needed to find mental health support while sheltering in place outside of what was then her home city. “When I couldn’t return to see my usual therapist, I used Mind Matters to connect quickly with a professional in my new location,” she says. “Having that kind of support was critical as I was going through such a transitional time.” If you’re feeling overwhelmed by anxiety or depression, please contact a crisis help line in your country. If you are a leader who is concerned about mental health challenges in your organization, please refer to these resources from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control . There are many actions that employers can take, including examples from: City Mental Health Alliance , One Mind at Work , and Shatterproof . Never miss a story"

October 9, 2020 Companies around the world are resetting business plans to thrive in the next normal, giving them a fresh opportunity to launch strategies that balance good business with good purpose. Last week, four of our colleagues joined the Financial Times for the Global Moral Money Summit—a two-day virtual event that convened leaders from the worlds of business, academia, policy, and beyond—to explore what that opportunity looks like and how the smartest organizations might seize it. Liz Hilton Segel: Building a More Inclusive Economy Our managing partner for North America Liz Hilton Segel defines an inclusive economy as one that creates resilient, higher-wage jobs for workers; ensures mental health needs are met; and provides opportunities for the underserved. Liz sat down with the FT’s US editor Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson to lay out how businesses play a key role in the creation of those elements and more. The adoption of AI and automation has accelerated during COVID-19, Liz explained, and to ensure this transformation doesn’t leave vulnerable workers behind, she recommended that organizations identify the skills their recovery models depend on, then develop and scale programs to close skills gaps among employees. On the mental health front, she recommended that companies practice empathy for employees and invest in training that equips leaders with skills to support colleagues who may be suffering. Finally, to combat systemic inequality in the workplace and beyond, Liz pointed out that companies can focus on ensuring they have the right representation of diverse talent in their pipelines; enabling equality of opportunity through fairness and transparency; and promoting openness and tackling microaggressions among their own ranks. James Manyika: Seeking to Thrive in the 21 st Century McKinsey Global Institute chairman and director James Manyika works at the leading edge of global economic and technology trends, giving him an excellent view into what it will take for top organizations to thrive in the 21 st century. He shared that perspective with the FT’s Gillian Tett in a wide-ranging conversation. COVID-19, James explained, has greatly accelerated several trends around the future of work. When considering the massive experiments with remote-work, it’s important to remember that only about a third of jobs can be done remotely. Many workers, therefore, are vulnerable, and they may experience temporary furloughs, permanent layoffs, or reductions in hours and wages. At the same time, companies are accelerating their digitization strategies and adoption of automation and artificial intelligence. Impacted workers must be supported by the businesses that employ them, the industries they serve, and the societies in which they live. So while today’s social contract has been great for some, it has led to challenging outcomes for the majority. These trends are likely to continue. James also discussed how the social contract that people experience as workers, consumers, and savers has changed. While the 21 st century has seen the creation of an enormous number of jobs, wages have not kept up. Consumer goods have gotten cheaper, but necessities like housing, healthcare, and education have become more costly. Most people, James said, cannot save money. So while today’s social contract has been great for some, it has led to challenging outcomes for the majority. These trends are likely to continue. Technological innovation, digitization, and globalization are opening opportunities for companies to be very successful, James added, but companies must also remember that they may be earning extraordinary profits amid a time of extraordinary inequality and rising concerns around race, diversity, and climate change. Citizens everywhere, James believes, will be looking to businesses to be part of the solution on these fronts. Marco Piccito: Morals, Money, and Sustainable Financing Based in our Milan office, Marco Piccito advises leading European financial and industrial institutions on a broad range of risk-management, business-strategy, and transformation issues. At the summit, he framed and then joined a panel discussion with BNP Paribas’s Chief Sustainability Officer Hervé Duteil and Pictet Wealth Management’s Head of ESG Rosa Sangiorgio on the state and future of sustainable financing. The FT’s Patrick Temple-West moderated. Marco explained that sustainable and ESG financial products have been very resilient during COVID-19 from both a cash-flow and performance perspective. For example, while non ESG equity fell by some 50 percent or more amid the crisis, ESG equity only fell by about 12 percent. This could be due to several factors, he said, including the unique behavior of sustainable investors or the resilience of sectors that sustainable investing favors. One insight Marco shared had to do with consumers, who have said they are far more in favor than ever before, by perhaps as much as 25 percent, of buying from companies that either sell sustainable products, have a stated purpose or a set of values, or that demonstrably care about the safety of their employees. Citizens everywhere, he believes, are demanding more of companies and reminding them, with due respect to Milton Friedman, that the business of business is now more than just business. Dickon Pinner: The Climate and Nature Imperative Dickon Pinner is the global leader of our Sustainability Practice, and in our final session at the Moral Money Summit, he joined FT Associate Editor and Business Columnist Pilita Clark for a panel discussion on the role business can play in finding solutions to climate change. Root Capital Founder and CEO Willy Foote and Walmart Chief Sustainability Officer Kathleen McLaughlin were also on the panel. According to Dickon, one area where climate change has emerged as a clear business priority is in capital markets, where the increased transparency for investors around risk awareness and opportunity have flipped the risk/reward equation; what were once perhaps seen as safe investments—fossil fuels, for example—are now often seen as risky bets, and what were once seen as risky—sustainable technology—in many cases now feel safer. McKinsey on Climate Change Dickon also explained how critical it is that companies gain radical transparency around the way their own businesses are shaping climate change Without that, he said, leaders are likely over-exposed to the risk and underexposed to opportunities around approaches like building a sustainable supply chain, for example, or reducing emissions. The positioning—as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink has put it—of “climate risk equals investment risk, which poses an existential threat to the financial system,” is quite clarifying, Dickon said. But there is still a massive amount of work for corporations and governments to do, he added, if we want to make measurable progress. related Liz Hilton Segel: What it will take to create a more inclusive economy Never miss a story"

What will it take to build more Black-owned businesses?,"From his London Tech Week keynote, partner Shelley Stewart explains how greater Black business ownership could help unleash $1 trillion in economic output.",2020-10-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/what%20will%20it%20take%20to%20build%20more%20black-owned%20businesses/shelley-stewart_hero_1536x864.jpg,"Our People,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/what-will-it-take-to-build-more-black-owned-businesses,"What will it take to build more Black-owned businesses? McKinsey partner Shelley Stewart is a leader in our Marketing and Sales Practice and co-leads our research on Black lives and livelihoods. October 15, 2020 COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on Black lives and livelihoods, and in the case of Black-owned businesses—which draw some 40 percent of their revenue from sectors that are most vulnerable to the virus—that impact raises concerning implications for the future of Black wealth creation. Black families in the U.S. possess about a tenth of the wealth white families do. If that wealth gap were closed, $1 to $1.5 trillion in economic output could be created. According to Shelley Stewart , a partner in our Marketing and Sales Practice who co-leads our research on Black wealth creation, increasing Black business ownership would play a key role in doing so. The median net worth for Black business owners, Shelley explains, is about 12 times that of Black non-business owners. And if all minorities owned businesses in proportion to their share of the labor force, we would see up to one million new businesses, nine million jobs, and $300 billion in worker income added to the U.S. economy. Shelley explained how that might happen—and why it hasn’t already—in a keynote presentation at accelerateHER during London Tech Week, an event that drew some 20,000 virtual attendees across 11 days. Immediately following his keynote, Shelley then co-convened a virtual roundtable alongside five other McKinsey leaders to brainstorm actions and initiatives that businesses, government, and investors could individually and collectively take to help address this issue. After the event, we caught up with him to learn more. Is this just a matter of inspiring more Black entrepreneurs? It’s about so much more than that. Twenty percent of Black Americans are starting or running new businesses right now—more than any other ethnic group. But only four percent of Black Americans run businesses that are older than three-and-a-half years. And the average Black-employer business earns only $858,000 in annual revenues; their white-employer counterparts earn $2.4 million. In addition, an analysis of nearly 10,000 founders and 135 of the most active venture capital firms in the world found that less than one percent of VC-backed founders are Black. This—again—is despite a nearly 20 percent rate of entrepreneurial activity by Black founders versus 12 percent of white founders. What are some of the factors that limit opportunities for Black-owned businesses? First, there’s the legacy of historical forces that have created a vicious cycle of persistent and systematic differences in opportunity for Black people in the United States. Black people have been ignored by markets, excluded and distrusted in society, and subjected to numerous structural barriers, including unfair rules and policies that have prevented their rise. Beyond that, this is very clearly an issue of a lack of representation among decision makers in the institutions that are deploying capital and among people who design processes that allocate capital. That lack of diversity creates a gap in understanding amid the ecosystem of founders, and it means that, far too often, Black businesses simply don’t get funded. Are organizations aware of that lack of representation? I think they’re aware, which raises a different and more important question—why is this the case? There’s enough research out there, including by our firm, that shows diversity of teams and thinking drives greater returns and opportunities to tap new customers and segments. So, I think it likely has to do with the way these institutions source their talent, and how they think about the availability of talent. It’s clear that the talent is there—but are we willing to do something different to find it? How do leading organizations think about talent sources right now? Even organizations that have a long history of recruiting at a number of contained schools have over time tried to think about expanding the funnel. This includes not only looking more at historically black colleges and universities but also at some of the big state systems of higher education, many of which offer big tuition incentives for top students of color or from disadvantaged communities. COVID-19: Investing in Black lives and livelihoods They’re also evaluating recruiting processes to ensure they’re as free of bias as possible, and they’re investing in talent development to ensure these efforts don’t end the moment a talented person of color walks in the door. They’re working to make sure people who may have unique needs are supported in their career development all along their journey. What role can government play? Governments at the federal, state, and local levels have budgets that they can deliberately put to work for Black-owned businesses. They can deploy dollars to support small business investment, and they can also play a role in buying goods and services from Black-owned businesses in their vendor selection and support processes. In government pension funds, they can find diverse fund managers and ensure those people deploy capital among diverse businesses. And finally, government has a role to play as a watchdog. Even among good processes, you may still have bad actors or clusters of bad actors, and governments can help combat bias and discrimination. How did people react to your keynote presentation on this at London Tech Week? The thing I’ve been hearing the most is that people are thankful that we’re out there speaking truth to the facts that lay bare these inequalities. There’s a lot more work for us to do on the dissemination side, but it’s gratifying to hear that this message resonates. What about the Black Lives Matter movement. Is that spurring change? I’m hopeful that some of the impacts from this moment will be deployed in a way that is sustainable. I see institutions making a series of commitments, but it’s important to make sure that those commitments are sustainable over time, even when public attention is not as focused on this issue. Finally, what’s your personal outlook on the possibility of progress? I’m optimistic in the sense that we’re having a national debate and discussion about a lot of these issues of injustice. We’ve seen numerous commitments from large corporations, and I’ve been in executive forums where these issues are being discussed with a new level of urgency and commitment. But change won’t happen just because people make commitments. We have to hold ourselves and these institutions accountable for the right metrics and right measurements that indicate real progress. related Three ideas from our first Black Investor Professionals Forum New research highlights gap between race and earning power in the US: Meet the authors Never miss a story"
Responding to COVID-19: Adi Kumar,"Meet Adi Kumar, a partner based in Washington, D.C. who has helped lead our work to help organizations respond to the COVID-19 outbreak.",2020-10-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/covid%20lives%20and%20livelihoods%20adi%20kumar/adikumar-hero-small-5050portrait-1536x864-bright.jpg,"Our People,COVID-19,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/covid-lives-and-livelihoods-adi-kumar,"Responding to COVID-19: Adi Kumar October 19, 2020 On a Sunday in early March, a client phoned Adi Kumar, a partner based in Washington, D.C., and asked him to join a call with the CEO of a hospital association that very night. “I’d been tracking what was happening with COVID-19,” Adi says. “But I did not expect to hear what I heard.” Across the state, hospitals and health systems lacked the necessary supplies to fight the health crisis. “That was the first call with a frontline institution that was looking just a couple weeks into the future and feeling really scared,” he says. “From that weekend on my life—like everyone else’s—changed.” Over the next few weeks, Adi, a leader in our Public and Social Sector Practice who also served in the Obama administration, began to support governments on their COVID-19 emergency response, particularly focusing on building resiliency among state health systems. Many of these organizations were facing both a surge in patients and shortage in medical supplies, including personal protective equipment. Social-distancing measures and other health protocols meant health system employees had to adapt their ways of working to best take care of patients. “A large part of our work in the early days of the pandemic was answering a basic but complex question: How do we best support health systems so they can fight this significant crisis?” Adi says. “Many of these government agencies face challenges in ordinary times, and COVID-19 exacerbated those issues.” This philosophy of helping others, especially when you’re in a privileged place to do so, is  inspired by Adi’s childhood. Born in India, he grew up in five different countries, including Indonesia, Singapore, Canada, and the U.S. “In India, my family was always lucky, but I would see the poverty that is a reality for so many in the country,” he says. “A lot of my desire to help people resides in the fact that I grew up witnessing a lot of inequality—and I think inequality is one of the biggest problems plaguing our country and our world.” Adi began his career at McKinsey as a business analyst after college. After a couple years, he left to pursue various roles in public service, most notably working on Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and later in the president’s administration overseeing the implementation of the Recovery Act. “This was an act that spanned 29 government agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Energy. I became passionate about how governments can do a better job of fundamentally delivering services for citizens,” he says. “It is incredibly difficult for governments to do that in times of crisis. Often what happens is budgets go down, and they have to deliver the same amount of services—or budgets go up massively, but there are no additional people to administer those services.” It was his experience in the White House that motivated Adi to return to McKinsey, where he wanted to focus on the public sector and work with governments to improve how they serve citizens on a daily basis. Before his COVID-19 response efforts, Adi helped state governments innovate and transform how they provide services.  This ranged from helping health and human services departments use data to reward high-performing providers, to launching one of the largest state-led programs to combat harmful algae blooms in rivers and lakes. We need to be taking care of the personal in order to be able to make any real progress on the professional and societal front. He also developed a real passion for healthcare through working with governments and private-sector healthcare companies.  “I’m not only deeply interested in helping governments deliver services in a different and better way, but when it comes to healthcare, I am also very interested in thinking about how to make what I consider to be an incredibly complex system work better for people,” he says. The COVID-19 crisis has brought an even greater urgency to this, and at times, surprising insights, too. “Often we spend time with clients in their workplaces or conference rooms, but I now find myself spending a lot of time in their living rooms—often with their kids on camera,” Adi says. “It’s opened up this realization that in order to get through what we do professionally,” he adds, “and contribute to trying to move our country forward, we need to figure out how to get through this personally. I’ve had a lot of conversations with my clients and friends about how they are coping with this—on top of their childcare realities, their parental care realities, their own mental states from being distanced from family and friends. We need to be taking care of the personal in order to be able to make any real progress on the professional and societal front.” Adi knows the path to progress won’t be simple—or a straight line. But he also firmly believes that we can’t go back to the way things used to be. “People realize we need to rebuild in a better, more resilient way,” Adi says. “And we should all embrace that because the future that we will have after this could be much better than what we had before.” related Doctors at McKinsey mobilize in fight against coronavirus A McKinsey doctor returns to her roots to fight COVID-19 Never miss a story"
Dame Vivian Hunt: The path to more inclusive stakeholder capitalism,"In her new TED Talk, Dame Vivian explains why business leaders must shift their business model to serve all stakeholders&mdash;not just shareholders.",2020-10-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/dame%20vivian%20hunt%20the%20path%20to%20more%20inclusive%20stakeholder%20capitalism/vivianted-hero-small-vivian-1536x864.jpg,"Inclusive Economy,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/dame-vivian-hunt-the-path-to-more-inclusive-stakeholder-capitalism,"Dame Vivian Hunt: The path to more inclusive stakeholder capitalism October 21, 2020 Many business leaders have recently promised to shift their business model to serve all stakeholders—not just shareholders. But as Dame Vivian Hunt, a McKinsey senior partner, explained in a TED Talk this week, executives will need to put action behind their pledges to ensure investment return will no longer take precedence over the health and welfare of employees, suppliers, and even planet Earth. Just as a company won’t go digital by appointing a chief digital officer any more than it can become more diverse by simply hiring a chief diversity officer, business leaders must understand that they need to do more. “We need to reset,” says Dame Vivian. “If we really want to serve stakeholder needs, we need to get everyone involved.” Here are a few ideas from her discussion, which you can view in full here . Starting at the top: the boardroom Boardrooms are where a company’s strategy is set and governed. If all stakeholder needs aren’t accounted for here, sustained change is unlikely. “By definition, a board can stand in the way of serving all stakeholders,” Dame Vivian says. “Why? Because often, a board is elected by shareholders. It represents their interests. It’s there to act on their behalf.” If organizations want to have a more inclusive business model, they’ll need board members “who truly understand the experience and represent the diversity of our stakeholders.” This isn't about ticking boxes on age, ethnicity, or gender. Protecting the environment “Sustainability goals have been written into annual reports all over the world,” Dame Vivian says. “The goals are very lofty, and very long-term, and none of them will be accomplished if they don’t have real steps along the way.” That’s why CEOs need concrete, achievable, measurable goals. They also need to share their data and progress along the way. Dame Vivian talked about the Brazil-based cosmetics company, Natura, which measures and publishes their impact on the environment—from seeds planted to trash disposed—alongside their usual profit-and-loss statements for investors. “Being green is good for the bottom line in the long run, but it requires investments, and those have to be shared.” How business can serve everyone, not just shareholders Empowering suppliers Suppliers are the connective tissue underneath many companies: drivers, widget makers, service employees. “They’re like an invisible life force that power our economy, and one thing we know for sure is that the success or failure of your business depends on your suppliers and partnerships,” she says. During the COVID-19 outbreak, suppliers have delivered the masks, ventilators, testing kits and vaccines that we all need. Elsewhere, Dame Vivian referenced BHP Billiton, an Australian mining company that committed to ending gender imbalance in its workplace by 2025. To do so, BHP Billiton partnered with Kal Tire, a supplier in Chile, to proactively encourage women to apply for jobs. Today, across BHP’s supplier networks, women are now 15 percent more likely to get the job than they were even a year ago today. Focusing on customers’ long-term needs When shareholders are the priority, some companies may have an incentive to focus on customers’ short-term desires rather than their long-term needs. As an example, Dame Vivian discussed the increase in processed-food consumption globally—as well as the increase in obesity rates—and pointed to the Access to Nutrition Foundation, which now tracks the salt, fat, and sugar that global food and drink companies include in their products, as well as whether they market them responsibly. “Companies that have been paying attention to this have begun to make changes, including ingredients and formulations,” Dame Vivian says. “We know that consumer needs change over time, but companies that make these investments proactively can be better positioned in the long term, even for shareholders.” “If customers are stakeholders, then they should not be harmed by the goods, services and products we produce. It’s that simple.” related Liz Hilton Segel: What it will take to create a more inclusive economy Never miss a story"

October 28, 2020 One autumn night in Georgia, Sara Prince, a McKinsey partner who helps clients build capabilities, settled into her favorite armchair to do a little work. The chair, a family heirloom, last belonged to Sara’s late grandmother, who just a few decades prior had sent her son—Sara’s father—to integrate a school in North Carolina. “She was an inspiration,” says Sara. “That chair is so special to me.” Sara’s work that night was also about advancing equality. She was reviewing a collection of fresh participant feedback from the kickoff meeting of a bold new McKinsey Academy initiative that aims to equip Black business leaders with the capabilities, mindsets, behaviors, and network they need to achieve their professional aspirations. Launched as part of our firm’s 10 Actions to combat racism, it’s called the Black Leadership Academy . The material Sara was looking at included dozens of testimonials from Black professionals across corporate America who had just taken a course in the academy’s executive leadership program. Each wrote openly and in detail about their experiences in the workplace. They described what the course, and the chance to connect with their peers, meant to them. As she read story after story, Sara immediately recognized her own—and found reason to be hopeful. “There are very few moments in my day when I am not the only person like me in a room or on a call at work, and we had hundreds of people join this session who go through the same thing every day,” Sara says. “So, I’m sitting there in my grandmother’s chair, and I’m reading all of these stories and notes where people are saying how powerful it felt to finally not be an only for once. And I was just feeling the joy—I had goosebumps.” Sara’s likely not the only one; the program is already hugely popular. According to Ankur Kumar , an associate partner in McKinsey Academy who specializes in executive leadership training and helped launch the Black Leadership Academy, enrollment numbers have skyrocketed across the program’s first few months. “When we rolled out our first session, we had about 4,000 Black business leaders enrolled,” Ankur says. “Now, we have more than 14,000 slots filled — we’re at capacity for the majority of 2021.” Ankur attributes that success to the Black Leadership Academy’s distinctive learning curricula, which are tailored to serve two cohorts: senior executives looking to ascend to the C-suite and early- to mid-career managers aspiring to join the ranks of senior leadership. “We think our biggest opportunity to help Black business leaders advance resides in these two groups,” Ankur explains. “McKinsey Academy has partnered with more than 400 companies around the world to help their people acquire the skills they need. We understand the capabilities and mindsets needed to join executive ranks—and we know how to help people get there.” The senior executive program, known as the Black Executive Leadership Program, focuses on building the leadership capabilities and network that successful executives need to help them achieve the next critical step in their careers. “These are people who are just a step or two at most away from the C-suite, but that move can feel like a giant leap,” says Ankur. “Our goal is to help them make it.” These participants learn what it takes to be an effective leader, how to deliver impact, and how to drive the transformational change necessary for success in today’s business environment. The Black Leadership Academy’s Management Accelerator, meanwhile, is designed for high-performing, early-tenured Black managers looking to move into senior leadership roles. It focuses on helping participants gain core management and leadership skills, as well as the cross-functional knowledge—across topics like strategy, finance, operations, and risk—it takes to lead successful businesses and teams. These programs are changing lives...I came away energized and ready to apply different leadership. The convening power of these programs is critical to helping Black leaders advance. It provides participants with access to a new ecosystem of peers, mentors, and sponsors across corporate America. “When all of us choose people for leadership opportunities, we tend to pick people we’ve sponsored,” Ankur explains, “and when we choose the people we sponsor, we tend to pick people we have things in common with—which means we tend to pick people who are like ourselves. This has been a huge hurdle, particularly for rising Black leaders, and we think our program has an opportunity to address it.” Black Leadership Academy alums are already attesting to its burgeoning impact. “These programs are changing lives,” said one participant from the retail sector. “The content was thought provoking, the time together was rich in reflection, and I came away energized and ready to apply different leadership.” Another leader from the healthcare industry agreed. “Without a doubt, the most powerful experience I can recall,” they said. “The ability to engage, connect, and share the deepest stories is where we are drawing the power from each other.” And although it’s still early days for the academy, it’s that power, assembled in this new setting, that promises a better tomorrow for Black business leaders. “Is what we’ve accomplished to date alone enough to sustain change? No,” says Sara. “But we’re going to keep doing this, and we’re going to scale it.” “That fact alone,” Sara adds, “gives all of us the ability to dream for a different outcome for Black people in corporate America in a way that hasn’t ever felt this real.” related What will it take to build more Black-owned businesses?

Photo by Mark Mason. October 28, 2020 We launched the next topic of our knowledge partnership with CNBC this week, transformation, as senior partner Harry Robinson explained how organizations must quickly transform on the path to the next normal—and why so many of these attempts fail. We spoke to Harry about COVID-19’s impact on the transformation agenda of global organizations, building the capabilities required to truly enable change, and his work with clients as a leader of McKinsey's Transformation practice. In the CNBC segment, you call transformation an “overused term” with a “terrible track record.” So what does McKinsey mean when we say transformation? If you look up transformation in the dictionary, it says “change.” So not surprisingly, we frequently see executives set their agenda with a transformation item, whether it’s salesforce efficiency or an organization’s culture. It’s used very loosely—part of industry jargon to put a stamp of gravitas around something. When we talk about our work in transformation as a practice, I’m talking about “capital T” transformation, which is a meaningful step change in performance that is sustained . If a company wants to make 10 percent improvement on margins, that’s great. But that’s not what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about fundamentally shifting the way your organization plays with competitors. Give us an example of what transformation work looks like in action. During the 2008 global financial crisis, I was working with a mining company that was headquartered in London and operated in Australia. Commodity prices had dropped because of the financial collapse, and the company either had to sell or shut down their Australia business—it was performing that badly. We wanted to give the client a third option: to improve the Australia business so significantly that the organization would generate a positive return, even if they had to sell. We pulled every transformation lever: cost, overhead, working capital, marketing, and more. In the end, the mining company’s Australia operation had improved so much they decided to keep it. Twelve years later, the Australia business is still part of the parent company’s portfolio. In that case, did you also look at the organization’s people? One of the most important aspects of any successful transformation has to do with building capabilities, and that’s often one of the most rewarding aspects of this type of work. That was certainly true here. In this case, not only were we able to give this client choices beyond keeping or selling the business, we were able to help their people. We retrained thousands of employees as a part of that project, which energized them and gave them new tools and skills. The path to true transformation How has COVID-19 affected this kind of transformation work? What have we heard from clients? Some sectors, like retail, were facing challenges before COVID-19, so in those cases, the pandemic has created greater urgency to transform. If unexpected, widespread closure of stores isn’t a good enough reason for retail clients to transform—so they can survive this challenge and come out in a better position—what is? Other clients are starting to realize that whatever situation they’re in now will likely be around for the next few months, so in those cases, we’re helping them plan for The Next Normal; at an existential level, what kind of company will they be in the future? What makes great transformations successful? We’ve found there are several elements that must be in place, from the CEO setting a high aspiration and leadership alignment, to ensuring teams feel empowered to drive the change required. Our research is really clear: roughly 70 percent of transformations fail. Sometimes CEOs haven’t set a sufficiently high aspiration, and other times, they haven’t built conviction within the team about the importance of this change. Successful transformations require a change narrative. In other words, your team has to be inspired to take on something that’s hard. They also require a real transformation infrastructure—a deliberate process of engagement, progress review, accountability, and pursuit of impact. Tell us about your journey at the firm. Why are you personally interested in transformation work? I’ve spent 15 years in the firm and now lead our Transformation practice. Early on, I traveled a lot and worked mostly with energy and basic materials clients, eventually leading that sector. Then about 10 years ago, I  reconnected with an old friend and colleague, Jon Garcia, who was in the works of launching our RTS  transformation approach, which continues to be a core part of our overall Transformation practice today. He asked if I had any clients who might be interested in this kind of work. I had an aluminum client who was keen, and the rest is history. I love it because our Transformation practice work allows for a different way of engaging with clients. It’s a much more agile way of working, with quick experiments and learning. And it’s a real partnership—because of the nature of these projects, which touch every function of the organization and every tenure of employee, we’re working side by side with clients from start to end. We’re in the trenches together. Never miss a story"

What reskilling and retraining efforts can help close the global skills gap? And how can leaders ensure their supply chains remain resilient? These are some of the questions discussed at the Fortune Global Forum, an annual event that brings together CEOs and other leaders in business to discuss how organizations are navigating the future. McKinsey served as knowledge partner of the event, and several of our firm’s partners joined to share insights from their client conversations as well as our recent research. Here are some of the most critical takeaways: Activating purpose to create a shared identity Purpose has become more than just a buzzword—it’s a top priority—for organizations during the pandemic. “There’s clearly a rising pressure to act on purpose as well as anchoring companies’ purpose into Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance priorities to make it measurable,” said McKinsey senior partner Bruce Simpson. “COVID-19 and social equality challenges have accentuated the importance of ‘S’ in ESG. ‘S’ for our clients starts with employees and authentic engagement on their needs and perspectives. Taking care of employees takes care of customers, which takes care of business.” Our firm’s research finds that people with a strong sense of purpose tend to be more resilient and recover better from crises. And it’s critically important for leaders to understand how to motivate and engage with their talent, according to McKinsey partner Naina Dhingra . “Our recent research found that 50 percent of employees surveyed are reconsidering the work they are doing,” she said. “We also found that employees who are able to live their purpose at work and see a clear connection between their work and individual purpose have five times higher well-being. Simply put, people who have a strong sense of purpose and feel that they can fulfill that purpose through work are doing better and these are the people who are most likely to be the ones who are going to be creative, motivated and help unlock new ideas and solutions.” Closing the global skills gap Before the pandemic, McKinsey Global Institute estimated 375 million workers will have to switch occupations by 2030 because of automation and AI. In a conversation that delved into the importance of reskilling and retraining as a result of the transformation accelerated by the pandemic, North America managing partner Liz Hilton Segel underscored that organizations should identify the skills their recovery business model depends on, then develop and scale tailored resources and programs to close any skills gaps among their employees.  “Every organization needs now to recommit to reskilling as a competency of their organization,” said Liz. “I am surprised by how many organizations still don’t have a reskilling competency, and I’m hopeful this moment will change that.” In addition to Generation , the independent non-profit founded by McKinsey in 2014 that works to recruit, train, and place people in jobs, our firm also partnered this year to support Talent Exchange , an online talent marketplace that aims to address the mismatch of labor supply and demand caused by COVID-19. The platform currently has more than 700,000 job opportunities across 6,000 cities throughout the US and Canada. Stabilizing the world’s supply chains The pandemic greatly affected global supply chains, but companies can expect to see more disruption ahead—and with greater frequency and severity. As a result, resiliency is becoming more important for boards and CEOs, according to MGI partner Susan Lund . “Our research finds that companies on average experience a 1-2 month disruption every 3.7 years, and this will wipe out over half of one year’s EBITDA every decade,” she said. Susan pointed to recent MGI research that finds leaders can expect to navigate a more disruptive, digital, and multipolar future ahead. To navigate risk, organizations will need to ensure they have transparency along the value chain—and with suppliers—and create the right set of metrics to evaluate risk. There are multiple levers that can help companies boost resilience in the next normal. Digitizing operations end to end, for example, can improve productivity and flexibility that will be “key to creating resilience” in supply chains, said McKinsey senior partner Katy George . “One of the things I see from leaders, like those joining me on this panel today, is the acceleration of digitization of product development and across the value chain,” said Katy. “This will not only open up new resilience opportunities, but transform business models. Leading companies are using Industry 4.0 technologies—digital, analytics, automation—and seeing a measurable impact across productivity, sustainability, agility, speed to market and customization.” related How COVID-19 could change capitalism as we know it Never miss a story"

He knew he wanted to be a combat pilot from the age of five or six when he first saw the movie Top Gun . Nearly a decade later while he was in high school, Jack felt a strong desire to serve his country in the aftermath of 9/11. ""I was inspired by the shared sense of purpose and unity in the United States,"" he remembers. After graduation, he was accepted into the U.S. Naval Academy, where he majored in political science. After graduating in 2007, Jack was commissioned into the U.S. Marine Corps, and from there went to flight school. He spent most of his eight-year career based out of Camp Pendleton, California, flying the AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter and was then deployed three times to the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Japan. Starting out as an attack pilot, Jack provided close air support as an aerial escort for the Marines and allied forces and graduated from the Weapons & Tactics Instructor course—the Marines’ equivalent to Top Gun . He eventually became the Operations officer of a squadron for more than 200 Marines and dozens of aircrafts. ""Overall my military career helped me to define and live my values: I wanted to serve my country and lead and develop the marines under my charge,"" he explained. Having spent much of his military career deployed in places where access to energy was both an economic and national security imperative, Jack wanted to make an impact in the area of sustainable energy when considering a civilian career. ""T he Department of Defense is the single biggest consumer of energy, and American leadership in transitioning to a clean energy economy is important, not just environmentally, but economically,"" he explains. He chose to continue his journey at the firm because of a similar commitment to values. “In the Marine Corps, it’s honor, courage, and commitment,” Jack says. “At McKinsey, it’s a commitment to our clients and our people and to creating positive, enduring change in the world.” Today Jack is based out of McKinsey’s San Francisco office, where he works with energy companies, utilities, and infrastructure developers. A recent example of his work includes helping a solar company reimagine their installation processes, significantly reducing costs, which made solar power more affordable for millions of families. In keeping with his commitment to the Marines, Jack continues to fly in the Reserve. At our firm, Jack has leveraged much of his Marines experience in his client work. “What I bring to McKinsey from the Marines is execution discipline,” he says. “This means making sure we identify the most important aspect in a project and go after it, prioritize strategically, create a workplan, and stay on track.” But his experience with different clients and teammates has also taught Jack how to inspire people in ways other than commanding. He talks about the importance of understanding what motivates someone—Is it family or community? Team or career? Or is it the mission? ""When you find out motivates people the most - then it's helpful to restate your goals and the benefits for them in that context,"" he says. People learn about others' motivations by listening carefully. ""Unstructured, casual conversations are where you find out the most important things,"" says Jack. ""Something that was much easier to do before COVID."" When it comes to what inspires his fellow service men and women, often it's not geo-political movements.

Recent data show that we have vaulted five years forward in consumer and business digital adoption in a matter of around eight weeks. But to sustain change, organizations will need to have the right digital capabilities. Here are six that are top of mind for our McKinsey Digital experts. 1. Diverse tech talent If leaders want to deliver on their digital aspirations, they’ll need a deep bench of diverse expertise and skill sets, says partner Belkis Vasquez-McCall , including data science, data engineering, product, and design talent. “Organizations need to get the people model right because that’s what enables a culture of iteration and innovation across the organization,” she says. That includes deciding which gaps in talent should be addressed through hiring or outsourcing, such data science, when organizations don’t have the right capabilities in-house—and which roles can be filled by retraining and reskilling existing employees. “You can’t turn a product manager into a data scientist or engineer, but it’s possible to retrain for roles like product owner or agile coach,” Vasquez-McCall says. 2. Customer-centric design thinking The pandemic’s toll on people’s emotional well-being and health has underscored the need for companies to think about serving customers with a much broader set of motivations and behaviors, explains Hyo Yeon , a McKinsey Design partner. “Design thinking is a critical part of the solution because it is rooted in the human experience,” Hyo says. She points to the various products—take grocery-delivery apps, for example—that have shifted during the crisis to service experiences because of rolling lockdowns and sheltering in place. “For customers, a banking app isn’t just about making a transaction anymore, but a way of managing financial wellness during this transitional time.” As the COVID-19 crisis continues to have an impact on our daily lives, customer-centric design thinking presents an opportunity for organizations to improve the way they serve consumers. 3. Agile ways of working Compared to traditional ways of working—in which an end goal will determine a project’s resources, cost, and timeline—agile ways of working present a fixed timeline, cost, and resources, while teams are encouraged to explore what scope of impact they can achieve within that framework. “An agile approach is a mindset shift for leaders—it’s all about what minimal viable product you can achieve within specific constraints,” explains partner Brian McCarthy. “This allows organizations to learn, iterate, and improve quickly before that MVP is then industrialized.” 4. Data literacy The ability to understand, analyze, and leverage data in decision-making is critical as organizations have access to more and more data from digital interactions with their customers, says Ines Marusic , an associate at QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s advanced analytics firm. Beyond the ability to use mathematical modeling, AI, machine learning, and other data-powered tools to substantiate decisions, organizations of the future will need to ensure their algorithmic models are fair and validated in production. “It is important for leaders to ensure they’re solving the right problems with data—not all problems are currently amenable to be solved using AI and machine learning in a way that ensures unbiased decision making,” she says. “Once you decide which problems, the ability to validate your solution as new data comes in is equally important.” Executive’s guide to developing AI at scale 5. Next-gen technology Engagement with cloud-based products and services increased significantly as the COVID-19 outbreak forced people around the world to shelter in place and work remote. And it’s a trend MGI partner Michael Chui says will continue given that many organizations won’t fully return to the workplace in the near term. “The move to cloud and other technologies is beyond just an adaptation to COVID-19,” he says. “For instance, many companies have found IoT to be helpful during the crisis for applications such as worker safety—e.g., determining if social distancing is being observed—but they will continue to use it for connecting with their customers, improving efficiency of their supply chains, and remote operations.” 6. Analytical reasoning Digitization may have been accelerated this year by the pandemic, but digital expert Maria Ocampo says it’s a continuous process for organizations that will require leaders and their teams to apply analytical reasoning in an ongoing way. “Our challenges are only going to be increasingly complex to solve—and because we can’t predict what they’ll look like exactly, it’s vital for leaders and their teams to be able to break down problems, analyze patterns in data, leverage new kinds of data, and continuously find different solutions,” she says. related Six digital trends gaining momentum—and why they matter Never miss a story"
"Need to make a tough decision? A virtual simulation helps organizations do it better, faster",A new McKinsey Academy workshop disproves two myths: good decisions take time and should only be made by a few people. ,2020-11-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/need%20to%20make%20a%20tough%20decision%20this%20workshop%20helps%20you%20do%20it%20smarter%20faster/decisions-hero-small-1035175240-1536x864.jpg,"Capability Building,Organization",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/need-to-make-a-tough-decision-this-workshop-helps-you-do-it-smarter-faster,"Need to make a tough decision? A virtual simulation helps organizations do it better, faster November 10, 2020 Even before COVID-19, we knew decision-making was top-of-mind for executives—it was the single most-read Insights topic in 2019. “But only 19 percent of the companies we surveyed believed they did it well and many ‘happened’ upon their best practices,” explains Aaron De Smet , a senior partner in the Organization Practice. “If a business can make faster, better decisions, they become more resilient.” Indeed, it’s become clear that organizations that can make good decisions faster have more effectively navigated the turbulence of the pandemic. For example, a big-box retail company took an 18-month plan for curb-side delivery and reduced it to two days for implementation. A luxury metropolitan hotel re-engineered itself into a barracks for health care workers, transforming laundry, check-in, meal service and security—in a week. Factories repurposed operations to produce personal protective equipment (PPE) in a matter of days. “Also, many companies are undertaking digital transformations and agile working practices, both of which accelerate learning and decision-making,” Aaron says. To support leaders and their organizations in developing this critical capability, experts from our Organization Practice worked with McKinsey Academy to create a simulation workshop. “We wanted our clients to experience the insights we uncovered from our research and turn them into behaviors that could help them make fast, high-quality decisions,” explains Leigh Weiss, a senior expert who helped design the program. The workshop was developed as an in-person program, but the McKinsey team quickly turned it into a virtual program as the COVID-19 outbreak began to spread earlier this year. A simulation can be a powerful learning experience because it involves practicing skills in a realistic context. “People step into a role, experience the emotions of a ‘persona,’ receive authentic feedback and experience consequences,” she outlines. “A well-designed simulation integrates periods of reflection, analysis, and intense activity, such as meeting a deadline.” Early in the program, attendees jump into a role-playing scenario in which they have to make a critical decision quickly. Only about 10 percent get to the right decision. “The ingrained habits and cultural mindsets of the team quickly surface,” observes Susan Zelenka , who produces the workshops. Participants often say the exercise, which reveals the common behaviors and dynamics that impede effective decision-making reminds them of what’s broken in their day-to-day interactions. ""I felt immediately stressed; it was chaotic, everyone had different information and priorities, and no one knew who the decision-makers were,"" recalls one participant. ""Frankly, it felt a lot like our decision meetings,” another remarked. “A lot of heated, unstructured discussion and in the end, nothing was decided.” The McKinsey team thought a lot about the scenario itself. “It had to be a universal experience, cross-industry, and involving different roles in an organization,"" explains Leigh Weiss. The hypothetical dilemma? A high-profile company needs to quickly expand parking on their campus for employees coming back to work post-COVID. A garage had collapsed; employee security and productivity was jeopardized; and millions of dollars were on the table. And then a car accident happened. Participants take on the roles of legal, HR, facilities, and financial department leads and debate the five options for the high-stakes decision. ""Within a day of finishing the first draft of the script, I went home and received a letter from the local high school about a flooded parking lot that was now closed. The next day, my colleague got an email that a decision had to be made about a parking issue in their co-op. We knew we had the right scenario,"" Leigh laughed. A key part of the agenda covers reviewing the research, including insights such as the four kinds of decisions companies make, each with different success factors. For ‘big bet’ decisions, such as an acquisition, the number one predictor of success is the quality of debate—it’s not about having all the data. ""It should be understood up front that while everyone has a voice, only a few get a vote—this was an “ah ha” moment for me. It allows you to incorporate diverse perspectives without slowing down,” explains Niranjana Rajagopal , who helped to design and runs the workshops. When it comes to more frequent and familiar ‘delegated decisions,’ it's important to coach your people through them, giving them the construct for how to make a decision, serving as a sounding board, but making sure not to take the reins back. In frequent ‘cross-cutting’ decisions requiring collaboration across an organization, it’s critical to map out the process and clarify the decision rights and roles at each point. Participants then run through the scenario again, applying the new insights, and see significantly improved results, both in reaching the right answer and in the process of getting there. ""COVID-19 has pushed decision-making to the edges rather than the center, and to the front line rather than the top of organizations. To respond faster, they have to equip people at all levels to make smart decisions—it can no longer be restricted to a few people at the center,"" says Aaron. ""Once they realize it doesn’t have to take two months—when it can be a week—why would they go back?"" McKinsey Academy related Want a better decision?

Our Black Voices: The journey to capture the perspectives of McKinsey&rsquo;s Black colleagues,"After the death of George Floyd, managing producer Osato Dixon sought to capture and amplify the voices of McKinsey&rsquo;s Black colleagues through a video series.",2020-11-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/our%20voices%20my%20journey%20to%20capture%20the%20perpsectives%20of%20our%20mckinsey%20black%20colleagues/ourvoices-inline-osato-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Diversity,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-black-voices,"Our Black Voices: The journey to capture the perspectives of McKinsey’s Black colleagues Osato Dixon pictured filming “Our Black Voices” in New York City. Osato is a managing producer at McKinsey. Previously, he served as an executive producer for HBO, Broadway Video, and NBCUniversal. In graduate school, Osato was awarded a Fulbright fellowship to Zimbabwe. While there, he served as the cinematographer on the documentary, Music by Prudence, which won an Academy Award. He holds a B.S. from Northwestern University and an M.F.A. from Columbia University. November 12, 2020 When George Floyd was murdered on May 25, conversations about race were everywhere—from news headlines to social media. Yet it felt some of the most important voices within the Black community were not being heard. I felt compelled and a sense of responsibility to contribute to the discourse in a meaningful way, not only as a filmmaker but also as a Black man living in America. I sought to do this through Our Black Voices, a video collection featuring perspectives from more than 50 Black colleagues at McKinsey across America. It was a personal opportunity to tap into—and amplify—the reservoir of knowledge, experience, insight, and awareness that is abundant in the Black community, which so often remains unheard. As I sat down to decide the best approach for this project, I reflected on what’s always been a driving force in my filmmaking: discovery. When you’re making a documentary film, there’s no clear narrative when you start, but there is a clear sense of purpose. A great part of the joy of the process is learning, pivoting when you discover something new, and meeting people where they are. With Our Black Voices, that meant sometimes, colleagues were ready and very willing to share their stories with me. Sometimes, they weren’t. It’s not hard to imagine how painful it can be for Black people to speak about their experiences, and I didn’t take lightly the responsibility of creating a space for people to share their truth and vulnerability. The colleagues who agreed to let me interview them took a risk: As a Black man, I’m familiar with being hesitant to speak out. First, there’s the fear of sounding like you’re complaining. Then there’s also an emotional vulnerability required in putting yourself out there. Moreover, no one wants to go first. So I worked hard to gain my colleagues’ trust because I understood where they were coming from. But I also knew we were creating something special—and we were going to do it together. Because of the pandemic and social-distance restrictions, I assembled a small crew, and together we drove 14 hours from New York to Atlanta and captured more than 20 colleagues in four days. A few days after that, we drove to D.C. from New York in the morning, filmed all day, then packed up and drove to Philadelphia that same night. Before and after each filming, the crew and I got tested. During the interviews, I wore a mask but my colleagues took theirs off when speaking on camera. We social distanced, but we talked about really sensitive things, like the trauma of being Black in everyday life. They spoke about experiences that I could relate to on a very personal level: Most, if not all, recalled childhood moments when they first realized what their race meant and how it would shape their lives. Our stories pulled on common threads. When I think of my experience creating Our Black Voices so far, I’m reminded of how complex Black culture is in the United States—and beyond. Through conversations with my colleagues Sara Prince , Tiffany Burns , Monne Williams , and others, I’m reminded of the complexities of being a Black woman in America . And as the son of a mother from Nigeria, I have a renewed and deeper appreciation for the experiences of Black immigrants. The irony and tragedy of the events that unfolded to bring us together is not lost on me. I recently read a quote from the writer, feminist, and civil rights activist, Audre Lorde: “Without community, there is no liberation.” I’m thankful for the liberating moments I experienced during this process. In a typical documentary, only 10 percent of the content makes it into the final cut. You can only imagine the journeys we went on together in the remaining 90 percent. I’m very thankful to Dame Vivian Hunt , who enthusiastically gave me the green light to proceed three minutes after I first sent the idea to her and other firm leaders. And to senior web developer Petra Vincent , who created a distinct digital experience internally with a more comprehensive set of the videos for all McKinsey colleagues to view. I hope Our Black Voices provides viewers with an opportunity to hear from, engage with, and consider Black perspectives. And I hope it inspires understanding as an impetus for change. I suspect many people will be taken aback by what they hear in these interviews, whether it’s straightforward honesty or the fearless vulnerability. By better understanding the experiences of our colleagues, I’m hopeful perspectives, perceptions, and biases change so that you’re inspired to listen more deeply to the Black voices that surround you. These three videos are just the beginning of an ongoing project. I’ll continue working to capture our Black colleague voices across our global firm in hopes of building the largest collection of Black professional voices to ever exist. As a filmmaker I remain hopeful and energetic to see where this story goes. Our Black Voices Never miss a story"

Celebrating servant leadership on our global &lsquo;Day of Service&rsquo;,"McKinsey&rsquo;s offices around the world are reflecting on equity, justice, and inclusion and finding ways to serve our local communities.",2020-11-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/our%20day%20of%20service/dayofservice-hero-small-collage_1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/our-day-of-service,"Celebrating servant leadership on our global ‘Day of Service’ November 18, 2020 This month our firm is celebrating servant leadership—the concept of leading from a desire to serve, which is core to our values—by observing a Day of Service where colleagues across the globe are hearing from speakers, volunteering in our local communities, and honoring role models among us who are leading the way in advancing social or racial justice and equity. The Day of Service is one of 10 Actions to which we committed earlier this year to do our part. Tiffany Burns , a McKinsey partner based in Atlanta, explains that this day is also an opportunity for our colleagues to explore the roles we can play in creating  a more equitable and just society. “This summer’s brutal episodes of racial injustice energized so many colleagues across our firm to want to help in some way,” she says. “We felt that such a day would enable people to lean in and act with their respective office communities.” Held over three days this month in our offices around the world, colleagues are gathering virtually or in person as local guidelines allow to reflect on what is happening in our communities. They will also hear from speakers such as Ken Chenault , former American Express CEO and chairman and current chairman and managing director of General Catalyst, and political and equalities activist Lord Simon Woolley on racial justice and inclusion. Our social responsibility Each region is focusing on a  theme centered around equity, justice, or inclusion: racial equity in the Americas, immigrant and other minority communities in Europe, women’s education and empowerment in Greater China, economic inequality in the Middle East and Africa, and indigenous and other minority communities in Asia. Volunteer opportunities range from working with local non-profits on areas such as combating hate speech and environmental sustainability to participating in trainings on what allyship for underrepresented and marginalized communities looks like. And while this day is a first for colleagues to come together globally in this way to give back—whether assembling packages for a food drive in New York City, working with underserved students in London, helping to promote equitable treatment for migrant workers in Singapore, or supporting a school in Johannesburg to prevent student dropouts—many have long been involved individually in community service, exemplifying what servant leadership looks like. We share a few of their stories below. As Tiffany says: “Whether it’s a community organization or official pro-bono work colleagues commit to supporting, we want to raise awareness of the possibilities that exist and provide people with a path forward for making a difference.” Meet some of our colleagues who are passionate about community service: Thaksan Sothinathan Senior associate, Europe The son of Tamil war refugees in Germany, Thaksan Sothinathan has committed his time outside of client work to equal education and job opportunities for the Tamil diaspora since joining McKinsey more than two years ago. “I’ve lived in two cultures my whole life—Tamil and German,” he says, “and feel fortunate to have parents who fought for my education despite financial constraints.” He talks about his desire to “pay it forward.” As the first person in his family to earn a higher-education degree, Thaksan is committed to helping other Tamil immigrants attain the same achievement. Co-founder of the largest Tamil student and professional network in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Thaksan also mentors school students and advises fellow local volunteer initiatives in his rural German hometown on ways to close the generation gap. Jialing Jiang Social responsibility manager, Greater China Two years into her tenure at McKinsey, Jialing Jiang has played a pivotal role in revamping our Greater China’s social responsibility initiatives. It's been a passion of hers since first joining the firm. Since co-founding the region’s social responsibility governance model last year, she now collaborates with more than 100 colleagues on volunteer efforts to improve access to quality education for underprivileged children, provide job training for migrant workers, and fight climate change. “From my first day at McKinsey, I’ve known that as a firm we have a powerful ability to drive positive change in the world,” Jialing says. “While we have a ways to go, what gives me hope is all the inspiring leaders and colleagues I’ve met along the way here who share the same vision.” Catherine Cooper Executive assistant, North America A leader of our Washington D.C. office’s volunteer efforts, Catherine Cooper has devoted herself to the local community for the past few decades of her McKinsey career. With a focus on serving the underprivileged—particularly those struggling with food insecurity—Catherine regularly organizes food and clothing drives, food pantry donations, prom dress collections, and career coaching programs. Throughout the pandemic, she has adapted many of these events to be virtual so the whole office can still participate. Now focused on the upcoming holiday season, Catherine is running a virtual food bank donation event to ensure no one goes hungry in the D.C. community and using her home as a delivery point for all collected goods. “Oftentimes, a common barrier for people not to volunteer is a lack of knowledge on how or where to get started,” she says. “I want to do everything in my power to make our volunteer events easily  available for our colleagues so everyone can share in a chance to give back.” Never miss a story"

November 19, 2020 We launched the third topic of our knowledge partnership with CNBC this week—reimagining organizations—as senior partner Mary Meaney explained how companies must transform the way they operate for the next normal. We spoke to Mary about COVID-19’s impact on global organizations, the role purpose plays in reimagining how companies do business, and her work with clients as co-leader of McKinsey's Organization Practice. Reimagining the way businesses operate 1. What learnings have we uncovered during the COVID-19 crisis? Given the acceleration of digital during the pandemic, companies have had to operate at a pace unimaginable before COVID-19. Now leaders want to understand how they can hardwire these behavior changes into the organization so that they remain stronger in the years ahead. A lifelong approach to learning will be an important factor to success: For example, technology skills are becoming obsolete faster because of the pace of digitization, so in order for organizations—and their talent—to thrive, it’s important to remain curious, have a learning mindset, and have an ability to reskill, renew, and innovate in an ongoing way. 2. What should organizations that want to reimagine the way they do business for the future ask themselves? Even before the pandemic, there were many mega trends, such as digital, automation, an increasing focus on purpose, and changing consumer expectations, that were affecting global companies. COVID-19 has accelerated those trends. We’ve been looking at the three questions organizations who want to succeed over time must answer: First, on the simplest level, who are we? Organizations need to identify their purpose, understand how they create value, and develop a unique, purpose-driven culture. The second is: How do we operate? Companies that are more agile, have a flatter structure, make decisions faster, and put their talent into the critical roles are coming out thriving. And the third is: How do we grow? Organizations that have resilient ecosystems, the right technology and data platforms, and a learning mindset are far more likely to succeed and thrive over time. 3. In the CNBC segment, you said that having a “resonant purpose” has never been more important when it comes to motivating talent and driving deep change. Why has purpose become a critical priority for leaders? Before the COVID-19 crisis, 82 percent of U.S. employees said it was important for organizations to have a compelling purpose—but only 42 said their company’s stated purpose had much effect. This year, as leaders have navigated the pandemic, they’ve realized they’re responsible for more than just shareholder value. Belonging matters, and we are all interconnected in ways we couldn’t have imagined before COVID-19. Leaders have also seen how their teams have shown up during the crisis to accomplish incredible things, and they won’t soon forget that impact. So I think the bar on purpose is only getting higher, but purpose has to go far beyond nice statements on posters in the office. Employees are really looking at how organizations operate and work to deliver on those commitments—and the choices and decisions their leaders make. 4. How are we seeing some of these themes play out with our own clients? During a crisis, things tend to accentuate: Teams that were fragile have either come together to do amazing things—or they’ve fallen apart. The crisis has been an unfreezing moment for our clients. Through fast, high-quality decision-making, organizations have been able to transform at a pace that would have been unimaginable before COVID-19. And I think what’s really exciting is that our clients are now embedding some of these changes into the way they work to ensure they’re not just returning to the previous normal, but resetting their operating models to succeed and thrive. 5. You have been one of the leaders of McKinsey's research on women since its early days. How do you stay motivated even though change has been slow? Part of is professional—we know diverse organizations outperform their less diverse peers —and part of it is personal. I have 6 children, including 5 amazing daughters. And I want to improve the world for them. If we look at the statistics, we see that progress on diversity is variable at best: We see more women on boards, but we see all-too-few women CEOs or  senior executives. And COVID-19 has made the situation worse: Our latest research shows that more and more women are considering leaving the workforce entirely, and the impact of COVID-19 on women of color is even more dramatic. Without real attention to this issue, many organizations will lose the progress they have made. related Kate Smaje: Why businesses must act faster than ever on digitization Never miss a story"
"What to expect from holiday shopping, according to our consumer insights",McKinsey partner Kelsey Robinson talks about how consumer sentiment is evolving in response to changes in the pandemic and what this means for retailers.,2020-11-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/consumer%20trends%20holiday%20shopping%20cautious%20spending%20fleeting%20loyalty/kelseyqa-hero-full-1281851439-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Growth, Marketing & Sales",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/consumer-trends-holiday-shopping-cautious-spending-fleeting-loyalty,"What to expect from holiday shopping, according to our consumer insights Curbside pickup is expected to be a popular delivery option for the holidays. November 20, 2020 In early March, before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, a small team at McKinsey started doing consumer research. “We knew our clients would need to understand how their customers were doing during this crisis,"" recalls Kelsey Robinson, a partner in our Marketing & Sales and Retail Practices. “We ran the first survey on a Friday in the U.S. with 1,300 people, asking about their health, financial situations, sense of optimism, worries, plans for household spending."" As COVID-19 became a global pandemic, we expanded the survey from one to 45 countries , polling participants weekly through July; now the survey is conducted monthly. The most recent results are in—with early signals about holiday shopping . Here, Kelsey talks about how consumer sentiment is evolving in response to changes in the pandemic and what this means for retailers. Before we get into the research, tell us a bit about your background. I grew up on the East Coast and my path has always been a combination of art and science. My mother was a nurse and dad was a construction estimator. In high school, I loved both art and calculus and wondered: should I be an architect? Engineer? In a way, bringing an analytical approach to consumer brands combines art and science. And, I am a passionate shopper: I find joy in finding exceptional brands and in buying for others; I am often a 'focus group of one' for my clients buying apparel, footwear, beauty products, home décor, children’s wear and more. What does the survey data reveal about how retailers and consumers are thinking about holiday shopping? As we would expect, holiday shopping is looking different this year: It is starting much earlier and about half of the shoppers we surveyed—48 percent—say they will be shopping online. The McKinsey team behind our consumer research. Top row : Sebastian Pflumm, Anne Grimmelt, Mayank Mayank, Yvonne Staack, Naomi Yamakawa. B ottom row: Nancy Lu, Resil Das, Tamara Charm, Mianne Ortega, David Hutchinson Holiday shopping typically begins in earnest around Thanksgiving with the weekend between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But this year it kicked off in mid-October with Amazon Prime Days , which were a big win in particular for Amazon products (e.g., Echo) and for their third-party sellers: small and medium-sized businesses. Retailers are sending out holiday promotions early to lock in sales and cement their position as the ""go to"" choice. They want to pull demand forward, and ensure they have enough time to fulfill and deliver orders on time—in light of COVID-19 constraints on supply chains and fulfillment partners. How are shoppers approaching the holidays? I would say they are cautious: 42 percent say they plan to decrease their holiday spend this year and in keeping with that goal, three-quarters will be looking for deals at the season’s blockbuster sales. While the holidays may look and feel different this year, it is clear that Americans are needing the break, shopping aside. The day-to-day is a struggle for the average household right now. Over a third of Americans continue to report a decrease in income over the trailing two weeks. Eighty percent of families have children in a remote or hybrid-learning situation. One in three mothers say they are considering decreasing their hours at work or leaving their jobs altogether as they struggle to manage both work and taking care of their children. It's a real stress and financial burden that has persisted through the pandemic—a trend that also shows up in our recent Women in the Workplace research. Looking at trends over the year, what surprised you most about the research findings? I would have to say the shock to brand loyalty was definitely surprising. More than 73 percent of Americans have tried new shopping behaviors, such as experimenting with new brands, trying new retailers, buying through new channels such as ordering groceries online, and trying new experiences like curbside pickup. And of these, some 80 percent plan to continue with their new choice. It also differs by age: Gen Zers have suffered the greatest impact to income from the pandemic and are more likely to trade down to less expensive new brands. But they also have the highest intent to spend more online and are the most optimistic about economic recovery for the country. So while retailers view millennials and Gen Zers as ""must wins,"" they are the least loyal and most financially challenged right now. How have changing restrictions and shutdowns affected consumer behavior? In early fall, as restrictions started to lift, people were venturing out to shop and dine, see family and friends and plan travel. And we saw a corresponding drop—maybe a bit of fatigue—with some online activities including work and personal video conferencing; online workouts, and streaming content. And we are starting to see movement among shopping categories: Consumers are evolving from shopping only for essentials like groceries to beginning to be interested in buying apparel or even jewelry. But there is still anxiety about going to malls, flying, and traveling more than a few hours from home. As the virus starts to peak again and we see a new wave of shutdowns, it will necessitate a return to the digital shopping behaviors of the first lockdown. As of early fall, some 45 percent of holiday shoppers were planning to do at least some degree of shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. What sort of experience are they looking for? Consumers want a seamless digital experience when they shop—benefits like touchless check-out and curbside pick-up. The environment must be hygienic and safe; the single most important factors are universal mask wearing and protective barriers at check-out. Stores must have access to a full inventory with knowledgeable staff on hand to answer questions. Shoppers are making fewer but more purposeful trips: They want to build baskets quickly, with less time spent browsing. It's a real challenge for retailers: How do you differentiate your store with personal, thoughtful attention, full product lines and expertise, when people want to be socially distanced and move quickly through a sanitized, touchless experience? Personalized promotions, extensive product information, and empathetic service will all become important. As you look back at this year, what three words come to mind? It has been tumultuous, day after day. As the holidays approach, I am nostalgic. For the first time, like many people, I won't be traveling to see my family for the holidays. But most of all I am appreciative—grateful for all things we might have taken for granted before: our health; my family; and the chance to continue to work with my clients and teams, even if via video. related 2020 Holiday Season: Navigating shopper behaviors in the pandemic Never miss a story"
Pradeep Prabhala: Fighting hunger today and strengthening food security for the long term,"From the biotech design of food to the delivery of dinners, a partner shares how our firm is working to strengthen food security.",2020-11-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/pradeep%20prabhala%20fighting%20hunger%20with%20short%20term%20help%20and%20long%20term%20change/foodsecurity-hero-full-1139776668-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Inclusive Economy,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/pradeep-prabhala-fighting-hunger-with-short-term-help-and-long-term-change,"Pradeep Prabhala: Fighting hunger today and strengthening food security for the long term November 24, 2020 Pradeep Prabhala recalls growing up in India as part of an emerging middle-class family. “While we didn’t go hungry, there were weeks when people didn't have enough to eat—the people you work with, see in your apartment building, in the shops and garages. Hunger was a fact of life,” he says. Eventually, it became the guiding force of his professional work. Today, he is a partner in our Agriculture Practice and leads our firm’s initiative for food security in the U.S., which reached crisis proportions this year as the pandemic gripped the country. As businesses closed and unemployment numbers reached new highs, food insecurity among families almost tripled from its previous baseline measure . “Food banks could respond initially to the pandemic because of federal government support,” says Pradeep, “But this aid will dry up. And they traditionally get a lot of their donations from restaurants and retail outlets which are also disappearing. I worry about what will happen in six months.” After training in India as an engineer, Pradeep worked for 13 years helping public and private sector organizations address the issue of food security and recalls 2008 as a turning point. “There was a global crisis. Demand for food rose as developing countries saw significant economic growth; crops were redirected from feeding people into bio-fuel production, and speculation in commodities drove food prices sky-high,” he recalls. “The global community organized around this issue.” During this period, Pradeep had the opportunity to work with eight countries in Asia and Africa on their agricultural transition programs. But it was his time working across sub-Saharan Africa that truly opened his eyes. “Here 80 percent of the farmers were smallholders who didn't earn enough income to sustain a living,” he says. ""I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to this work.” Five years later, he moved to the Washington D.C. area with his family and found he could continue with his mission. “In developed countries, equitable access to food—and also to healthy nutrition—is very much a challenge as well, one that impacts productivity, healthcare costs and even the environment,” he said. McKinsey started its North America food security initiative in 2019 and by this summer,  some 50 colleagues across the country were working on a variety of projects on a pro bono basis. They include experts on food systems, operations and supply chains, data analysts, professional instructors and designers. They are on the ground helping food banks optimize their warehouses and logistics, build employees’ skills, and apply analytics to improve distribution and predict and manage spikes in demand. Other projects take a more holistic, transformative approach: helping the charitable food system become more resilient and strengthen their networks through partnerships, gain greater control over the resources they receive, and improve their client experience. “As an example, a project is underway in which designers are conducting ethnographic research to better understand the food bank experience for users and identify ways to increase reach and reduce stigma,” says Pradeep. “This may mean changing how people pick up food, improving the quality and nutrition of the offerings, and how food banks interact with their communities.” Food security A McKinsey team is also helping organizations address the structural causes of hunger, such as lack of sustainable jobs and limited safety nets. They are surveying the global landscape, taking in both public and private sectors, for innovative models and interventions. “In some countries, an insurance company might incent its customers with certain benefits to eat healthier, as an example,” says Pradeep. “With advances in microbiome sequencing, private companies could design foods that are customized to the microbiomes of communities and deliver greater nutrition.” In addition to working directly with employees on the ground, McKinsey Academy is also building capabilities among the leaders in the system and MGI is building a research foundation for our approaches. “As a firm, we want to balance short-term help with long-term change,” explains Pradeep. “This means addressing hunger today but also helping organizations develop interventions for tomorrow. Otherwise, in the next crisis, we will be having the same conversation.” Never miss a story"

December 1, 2020 No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram was just named the 2020 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year. In the book, Sarah Frier, an award-winning journalist, tells the story behind the pictures—of Instagram. She chronicles the evolution of a photo-sharing app into a global force that influences our everyday life: the way we eat, look, travel, socialize, and communicate. The award was announced by McKinsey global managing partner Kevin Sneader and Financial Times editor Roula Khalaf at a virtual event today. Laxman Narasimhan, CEO of Reckitt Benckiser Group and a McKinsey alumnus, joined as a special guest for the fireside chat. “Sarah Frier has written a compelling saga about how this start-up phenomenon deeply embedded itself into the global cultural zeitgeist of this digital era, in just one decade after its creation,” said Kevin Sneader. No Filter offers a candid close-up of Silicon Valley culture, tracing Instagram’s early days as a start-up, its acquisition by Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, and the founders’ ensuing struggle to retain the independence and integrity of their brand. In discussing her motivation in writing this book, Sarah said, “unless we understand the way these technology companies make their decisions, the trade-offs they choose, and the metrics they incentivize, if we don't understand all of this, we are being manipulated.” The judging panel deliberated the merits of the six finalists for the £30,000 prize. In addition to Roula Khalaf, who chaired the group, this year’s judges included Mitchell Baker, CEO of Mozilla; Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz; Herminia Ibarra, professor of organizational behavior at London Business School; Randall Kroszner, professor of economics at University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Dambisa Moyo, global economist, author, and nonexecutive board member of 3M Company, Chevron, and Condé Nast; Shriti Vadera, chair-elect of Prudential; and Raju Narisetti, leader, Global Publishing, McKinsey. “ No Filter is a topical and well-reported account of the rise of Instagram and its takeover by Facebook. But it also tackles two vital issues of our age: how Big Tech treats smaller rivals and how social media companies are shaping the lives of a new generation,” said Roula Khalaf. The Bracken Bower Prize for the best business book proposal in 2020 by an author under 35 was also awarded today. Stephen Boyle , head of data design at Lloyds Banking Group , won the prize for New Money . The proposal outlines the story of Libra, a new digital currency that promised to upend the world of money as we know it, and its swift, sound defeat by the global banking system it threatened.

Founding the Institute is one of the 10 Actions we announced earlier this year to deliver change within our firm and do our part to advance social and racial justice and equity. “The events of this year reflect longstanding inequities, rooted in a long history of systemic discrimination,” says Shelley Stewart , a McKinsey partner and co-leader of the Institute. “Yet, they have also presented opportunities to move the inequity conversation beyond the four walls of individual companies.” Nick Noel , an engagement manager, says the Institute has been designed to help connect leaders who share an interest in driving racial equity, but who might not otherwise find ways to leverage one another’s strengths. “While the commitments made by so many organizations around the world to address racial inequity are incredibly encouraging, institutionalizing changes across public, private, and social sector organizations is what could help really move the needle long-term,” he says. “Our goal for the Institute is to help foster that vision and level of collaboration.” The McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility 's initial research effort, It's time for a new approach to racial equity , references that more than 46,000 Black Americans have died from COVID-19 and that “no single sector can solve this problem on its own.” In the piece, we outline five key elements for success, and in the coming months, the McKinsey team will publish new research in collaboration with the McKinsey Global Institute across topics, including an analysis of how Black Americans participate in the U.S. economy. For associate partner JP Julien , the Institute's work is personal, too. Having been raised by a large, immigrant family from Trinidad, he recalls growing up in parts of New Jersey with high levels of poverty before later moving to a high-opportunity neighborhood, where he saw greater economic investments for residents. “This inequity is not a historical artifact,” he says. “It’s the present-day reality of living in the U.S. where the place you live and color of your skin shape people’s outcomes. If we can provide organizations and leaders with the right tools and insights to do things differently, we can help transform under-resourced communities like where I grew up—and the world at large,” JP says.” In addition to its co-leaders and external advisory council, the Institute also has two McKinsey fellows: Avery Cambridge , a senior analyst, and Brenden McKinney , a business analyst. Avery explains how the work behind the Institute goes beyond leveraging data to underscore the root causes perpetuating systemic challenges among Black communities. “It’s also about getting people to feel accountable for their work and the direct implications it has on lives.” She talks about the unique opportunity our firm has to partner with our clients—90 percent of whom are Fortune 500 companies and major employers—to think about racial equity as more than a corporate social responsibility issue, but rather a chance to transform their businesses and serve customers differently. As Shelley says: “Racial equity efforts need to focus on more than corporate diversity and inclusion, which raise the ceiling—they also need to do the hard work of lifting the floor.” It’s time for a new approach to racial equity Never miss a story"
MGI turns 30: Five partners on research that made a difference,"From affordable housing and gender equality to unemployment and more, five MGI partners talk about why these issues resonate with them both&nbsp;professionally and personally.&nbsp;",2020-12-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"McKinsey Global Institute,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/as-mgi-turns-30-five-partners-share-favorite-research-projects,"MGI turns 30: Five partners on research that made a difference December 4, 2020 In 1990, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the business and economics research arm of McKinsey, published its first report about productivity, turning conventional wisdom on its head. The cross-country analysis employed a new method of calculation and included the service sector for the first time. The results surprised experts, showing the U.S. economy to be more competitive than believed. Thirty years later, MGI is still challenging conventional wisdom. ""We try to inspire new thinking about the most pressing issues of the world, with perspectives developed through data, facts, and analysis,"" says Michael Chui, an MGI partner. “Increasingly we are looking at the societal issues influential to our core economic work—gender equality, affordable housing, youth unemployment,” explains MGI partner Anu Madgavkar. “These topics need credible, apolitical, data-backed voices—a contribution that we can make.” As MGI marks its 30th anniversary this month, we asked five leaders to talk about a piece of research that has special meaning to them and how it helped to change thinking on a topic. “Just one research project? But we love all ‘our children’,” laughed Michael Chui when the question was posed to him. Here are excerpts from those conversations. Anu Madgavkar on gender equality I think our power of parity work in 2015 resonated deeply because it brought together the two different worlds of women for the first time: the social world—relating to health, education, care services, political empowerment, and physical security—and their economic world: how they participate in the economy and advance their careers. We created a Gender Parity Index (GPI) with15 indicators that knits together these two worlds and clearly measures the progress, or not, countries are making towards parity. An important insight was that the two can't be separated—they are intertwined and shape human productivity and growth in profound ways. As a result, we brought together policymakers from the social sector and business leaders for an ongoing dialogue and more holistic understanding of the barriers women face. Building on this, we recently analyzed COVID-19’s impact on gender equality and found it is translating into millions of women dropping out of the workforce around the world. We need to bring MGI’s fact-based analysis to shed light on critical societal challenges like this one. Jan Mischke on affordable housing It was the first time a structured, business logic had been applied to the topic which traditionally had been perceived as a social issue in the domain of NGOs. We also identified four “catalysts” for building developments. We knew we had hit on something when we began to get a lot of citations in large conferences and because of our exacting, structured approach, the report ended up being a must-read on affordable housing that people could use in very practical ways. It is always difficult to say what impact our research has but over time we saw a shift in the thinking in a number of countries. Affordable housing changed from being an issue to be solved by increased financing, to being a supply-side issue in which both public and private sectors can play strong roles. This means opening up land, developing supportive government policies, building around transit hubs, and using modern methods to reduce construction costs—to create the types of housing people need. To date, it has been gratifying to see our affordable housing research inform initiatives in Los Angeles, London, and Singapore, to name a few places. Jaana Remes on healthcare We always knew that healthy lifestyles were important, but for the first time this year, we actually quantified the social and economic benefits of what happens when, as a society, you take care of your people. The first—and very big challenge—is changing the perception of healthcare from being a cost and burden to becoming an investment. If we use interventions we already know—good nutrition, preventative medicines—combined with a handful of promising medical innovations—we can reduce the cost of managing disease by about 40 percent over the next 20 years. One surprise we found is that it’s not mostly “old people’ who suffer from ill health; many middle-aged people struggle with diabetes, depression, heart disease. By focusing on preventative care and known disease treatments, the average 65-year-old in 2040 could be as healthy as a 55-year-old today. What makes me really excited is the thought that we could add 10 years to the active midlife with what we know. Imagine how much quality of life we could all get in that time—contributing to your work, enjoying your family, and doing what you love. Michael Chui on technology and the future of work I have looked at the ways that technologies—AI, analytics, robotics, IoT—are influencing the global economy, and I think specifically of our research in how automation will change the future of work . We explored this in many dimensions: by specific jobs and tasks, level of skills, geography, by timeframe. We heard again and again that people were worried about mass unemployment due to automation: machines will take everyone's jobs. But, we found, in fact it's rare that an entire job will be automated away. You need to look at the individual activities of each job—and yes some may go away, but other tasks, often more interesting, may evolve with the position. Entirely new jobs and categories will be created. And this doesn’t happen overnight. Our colleagues have been helping CEOs transition their workforces for the next five to 15 years: What new skills, talents, organizational structures will they need? It has been incredibly rewarding to know our research is being used to reset thinking, reduce anxiety, and manage pragmatically for coming changes. Susan Lund on jobs and the impact of COVID-19 on lives and livelihoods Jobs and labor markets were a new topic for MGI that we started following the Great Recession of 2008-2009. It’s the first time we noticed that GDP growth doesn’t always lead to job growth. I led research on the “ jobless recovery ” and explored why it was taking so long for employment to recover after a recession. It changed the way that business leaders think about jobs because it highlighted the importance of helping people switch occupations and gain new skills throughout their career. More recently, we looked at how automation and AI are transforming work at the local level, and how job growth is increasingly concentrated in a few dynamic cities. In March of this year, we analyzed the potential job loss in the US and Europe due to COVID-19. We estimated that 1/3 of workforce could be laid off; it seemed outlandishly large at the time. Nine months later, the number of people applying for unemployment was even greater. We wanted to warn policymakers and business leaders how devastating this pandemic would be to workers. Within days, some industries were shedding entire categories of jobs, while other businesses couldn't hire quickly enough. The challenge of matching large numbers of unemployed workers to new jobs was urgent and we wanted to find a concrete way to help solve this problem we spotlighted. We supported the creation of Talent Exchange ,* an AI-based platform that automates job matching;  so far 120 companies have registered. To me our research on jobs and labor markets is really important because it affects individuals. Long-term unemployment is corrosive to our self-worth and linked to illness, divorce, suicide, even scarring the next generation. Much of our work is at the macro level and I love that McKinsey invests in understanding this aspect of the economy that's about individual people. related An inside look at how the McKinsey Global Institute creates a better understanding of the world Happy birthday, McKinsey Global Institute Never miss a story"
McKinsey named a &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; in Digital Transformation,"Our firm received the highest category ranking in The Forrester Wave&trade;: Digital Business Transformation Services, Q4 2020.",2020-12-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20named%20a%20leader%20in%20digital%20transformation/digitalanalystreport-hero-small-triptych-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-digital-named-a-leader-in-digital-transformation,"McKinsey named a “Leader” in Digital Transformation December 16, 2020 Our firm is excited to announce that McKinsey was recently named a Leader, the highest category ranking we can receive, in The Forrester Wave™: Digital Business Transformation Services, Q4 2020 . From building new digital businesses and helping organizations to modernize their technology, to transforming companies through data, analytics, and artificial intelligence, McKinsey Digital “delivers high-value end-to-end business transformation” and is “a good fit for companies seeking world-class strategy, innovative technology solutions, and organizational redesign as part of digital business transformation,” wrote Forrester. “After years of investment in this space, this recognition is a testament to the high-impact work our teams are doing across digital and analytics,” says senior partner Rodney Zemmel, who co-leads McKinsey Digital globally with senior partner Kate Smaje. And after a year that saw digitization accelerate at a pace previously unimaginable because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kate says: “Partnering with clients to enable this kind of change by bringing together the critical technology and capabilities for the digital age is the most important aspect of our work, and we were pleased to be recognized by Forrester with insights on some of our lesser-known capabilities.” In its report, Forrester also noted that McKinsey Digital is “particularly skilled at working with clients to pilot-test its hypothesis and prove value before ramping to scale and marrying the right technology with organizational change to ensure transformation sticks.” Here Kate and Rodney take us through three digital enterprise transformations we’ve partnered with clients to help drive: Bringing AI from pilot to scale to enable transformation at a North American airline A couple years ago, a North American airline came to us with a bold vision: Transform the company into an industry leader in using artificial intelligence across its business . “Our teams took a domain-based approach to the transformation,” says Rodney. “That meant looking at crew planning, ticketing, loyalty programs, operations, and more as a whole to see where digital and analytics could most rapidly deliver impact and in which order we should transform the domains.” Cargo was where the team decided to start given how challenging it can be to predict how much space airlines will have on a given flight: Passengers may show up with more or less luggage than you expect, but airlines can’t overbook the flight by too much in case customers arrive with urgent cargo—with no space to put it. The McKinsey Digital team worked to develop an MVP that could be tested in a pilot with a subset of the routes that were representative of their global network. After proving its value, the team scaled the pilot by leveraging years of historical cargo data—booking, cancellations, and final payloads—as well as up-to-date information on weather and other factors. The algorithm then delivered recommendations on how much space to book. After a 16-week pilot run, the tool delivered double the impact on revenue as expected—and the airline has adopted two more analytics-driven tools. As Forrester wrote in its report, McKinsey Digital’s “strategy of hiring top experts in their respective fields delivers relevant business outcomes for customers with relatively fast payback.” Transforming technology—and customer experience—at a global retailer When a retailer approached us about launching their digital customer experience around the globe, they knew it was an effort that would challenge both their business and technology teams to work in new ways. Our team helped design the transformation, launch and run a digital office to coordinate efforts across every area of the company (including their mobile app), and refine technology delivery plans and ways of working.  We also brought design thinking and a data-driven approach to refine their customers’ digital and physical experience, and a team of engineers and architects to ensure the new capabilities would run at a global scale. The retailer successfully launched their digital channels ahead of schedule. As our client launched these new digital channels, we helped them build the data analytics capabilities to improve customer and employee experience and create business value. Our team helped design and implement a cloud-based data architecture and set-up a new advanced analytics capability.  These new capabilities help them treat data as an asset, building machine learning-backed capabilities around personalized customer experience, employee safety, and predictive insights in operations. Rodney says: “It’s gratifying to support organizations in deploying emerging technology, such as automation and IoT, so they can deliver business value in ways they hadn’t imagined before. Our deep bench of technology experts ranging from cloud engineers to data scientists to designers work hand in hand with our clients to design, build, and deploy these solutions at scale.” Embedding agile ways of working into a mining company’s culture and using AI to increase production McKinsey Digital recently partnered with a global metal producer that wanted to boost its performance in a significant way. Although the client's initial interest was to learn how AI might help their technical processing operations, they were ultimately surprised to learn how important culture and ways of working would prove to capturing and sustaining impact. Cross-functional teams with a mix of seasoned mining expertise and up-and-coming digital talent were assembled across each of the company's assets. These teams were challenged to raise production at each of their core assets by 15-20 percent, in a period of roughly 18 months, with minimal spend. In addition to traditional tools, like lean, our team introduced two new digital capabilities to the client. First, the teams used AI models to help optimize each of the assets they were working on. Second, we introduced a new, agile way of working that allowed the client to rapidly prototype solutions and test them in the field for fast customer feedback. For an engineering-driven organization, this was a dramatic change that significantly improved their operations. A little more than one year into their journey, each client site has set multiple new production records, and several of the assets have hit or exceeded their ambitious 15-20 production improvement goal, despite the impact of COVID-19. In fact, the client believes that the new capabilities they built have helped them respond faster to the pandemic—and make their operations more resilient to disruptions. For this miner, what started as a journey to explore the power of AI turned out to be much more impactful enagement. While AI helped them identify and unlock new opportunities, the bigger surprise has been how much opportunity could be unlocked by embedding agile principles to their ways of working that ultimately allowed the client's talent to unleash their creativity. Because the agile approach was a change in both process and culture, we brought in coaches to help with the transition. “We know that building an agile organization requires reimagining how teams are structured and collaborate to deliver impact,” says Kate. “Our agile coaches were able to help the miner’s teams at all levels of the organization work in new, innovative ways—and unlock break-through solutions along the way.” related Kate Smaje: Why businesses must act faster than ever on digitization Never miss a story"

"McKinsey acquires Candid Partners, a leader in cloud consulting","With the recent acquisition of Candid Partners, we welcome 100+ senior cloud experts&mdash;developers, engineers, agile coaches&mdash;into our firm.",2021-01-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Acquisitions,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-acquires-candid-partners,"McKinsey acquires Candid Partners, a leader in cloud consulting January 15, 2021 McKinsey often helps clients grow by assessing new business opportunities, finding new partners, and undertaking due diligence. But in the case of our newest acquisition, Candid Partners, it happened to be a client who helped us make the match. A large organization asked us to help them with a major cloud transformation. They independently brought McKinsey and Candid together to solve a complex technical problem, and we worked side by side from initial strategy development through final implementation. This is just one of several examples in which our firms collaborated. Recognizing the value of our combined capabilities, we recently formalized the relationship, welcoming Candid Partners and their accomplished team of 100+ senior technical experts into our community. Moving forward, we will continue to bring our deep industry and functional expertise to cloud projects and Candid Partners ’ distinctive assets will be incorporated into the work processes, including their Matter platform, which assists in planning, provisioning and managing cloud security compliance. “We were immediately struck by the impressive depth and collaborative approach of the people we met at Candid Partners—and their track record of both solving complex technical challenges and delivering cloud programs for some of the world’s largest organizations,” said Steve Van Kuiken, a senior partner and global leader of McKinsey Technology . “ With Candid Partners’ people and knowledge, we will scale our technical capabilities and accelerate the rate at which we can help our clients achieve tangible business value from cloud adoption,” said Liz Hilton Segel , managing partner for North America. While our firms’ talent profiles differ, the cultures are very similar. “As an organization, Candid Partners applauds technical depth, creative problem solving, and a total focus on getting the job done,” explains Merrick Olives , who co-founded the firm with John Peak. “What our people value most is the opportunity to work on the most challenging technology projects out there – McKinsey can help our team realize this. ” When you have a client migrating a critical financial application into the cloud, we can bring experts to the table who’ve done this multiple times. This partnership comes at a time when companies are increasingly turning to cloud for its advantages over traditional IT models in terms of flexibility, speed, resilience, and scalability–critical features for virtual working, collaboration and accessing data—that have become more important during the pandemic. “Cloud is now a significant CEO/Board level topic and the most pressing enterprise tech opportunity our clients are dealing with today. It’s an important area that we will continue to grow,” said Kevin Sneader , global managing partner of McKinsey. Candid Partners , founded in 2013 in Atlanta, is one of the fastest-growing cloud firms in the country, with 95 percent of their work focused on Fortune 500 companies. They have successfully completed 250 cloud programs and are one of the only companies to migrate 100 percent of a Fortune 100 client’s applications to the cloud. “We have assembled a group of very experienced people including engineers, developers, architects and agile coaches. When you have a client migrating a critical financial application into the cloud, we can bring experts to the table who’ve done this multiple times,” says Merrick . “Our average technical person is 20 years into his or her career, which makes a big difference.” The integrated McKinsey-Candid Partners team will help clients with end-to-end cloud transformations, from initial strategy, business-case development and road mapping through to designing the architecture, migrating applications, and optimizing workloads. Our capabilities are essential given the greatest value from cloud is in enabling businesses to realize their strategic goals such as enhancing innovation, speed and scale, rather than simply cutting costs . For example, airlines can streamline their customer experiences, manage global information networks, and route crews and aircraft more effectively . Healthcare systems can rationalize complex infrastructures and deploy patient services that are mobile and flexible, while adhering to regulatory requirements. Automotive manufacturers can seamlessly connect thousands of suppliers in real-time across the value chain. “We believe the cloud holds immense potential, but most companies are only scratching the surface”, says Steve. “We are going to continue to invest in this area to bring the most distinctive capabilities to our clients.” Never miss a story"
Behind Roberto Uchoa&rsquo;s work to fight hunger and strengthen food banks,"Meet a senior partner who helps food banks better serve their communities through analytics, reskilling, and more.",2021-01-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,"Inclusive Economy,Our People,United States,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/roberto-uchoa,"Behind Roberto Uchoa’s work to fight hunger and strengthen food banks The Greater Chicago Food Depository, which Roberto Uchoa helps support, is a member of the Feeding America network that serves all of Cook County, including Chicago, the third largest city in the U.S. Credit: Kenneth Johnson for the Greater Chicago Food Depository. January 21, 2021 “When I meet someone new and they ask me what I do, I tell them I am spending a lot of my time trying to solve hunger,” says Roberto Uchoa, a McKinsey senior partner. “And I am.” Roberto’s work has never been more important than in this past year during the pandemic. According to Feeding America, more than 80 percent, or four in five food banks, are serving more people now than they did a year ago. And from March through October of 2020, four in 10 people visiting food banks were there for the first time. The work of food security is meaningful to Roberto both personally and professionally: he was born and raised in Fortaleza, a town in Northeastern Brazil where he experienced drought and poverty firsthand.  “For many people, hunger was a constant,” he recalls. After earning degrees in engineering, Roberto joined McKinsey in 1997 as a business analyst in Brazil before moving to the U.S. in 2002. A turning point in his career came around 2007. “All of my clients were trying to respond to the global food crisis brought on by a dramatic rise in food prices,” he remembers. “That time of focusing on food security brought so much meaning to my daily work that I knew this was the direction my life would take.” Pursuing this ambition brought him to hunger-stricken areas around the world. While he loved the travel—“the variety of countries I saw in Africa was fascinating: Malawi, Liberia, Kenya”—he wanted to spend more time at home near Chicago with his young children. He eventually stopped working with foundations, multilateral organizations, and governments in Africa, and focused more on agriculture and food and beverage clients in the Midwestern U.S. Two events eventually brought him back to food security: The first was a McKinsey Agriculture Practice meeting in 2014, at which a partner challenged the group to bring the impact our firm had achieved in Africa to the U.S., and specifically to Chicago, where 800,000 people are food insecure. The second was a McKinsey office challenge to donate one million meals to help local NGOs. This eventually led Roberto to partnering with the Greater Chicago Food Depository , a member of the Feeding America network that serves all of Cook County, including Chicago, the third largest city in the U.S. Over the next few years, Roberto and his team worked with the depository on a series of pro-bono projects focused on food-security issues. One of the most impactful focused on using the tremendous amounts of data the food bank collected, which included information on the movement of 74 million pounds of food annually as well as the characteristics of dozens of neighborhoods. “As you walk from one neighborhood to the next in Chicago, there is a tremendous disparity among people: in income, unemployment rates, poverty level, and life outcomes,” says Roberto. “The average life expectancy varies by more than 20 years across some neighborhoods.” The McKinsey team used this data to build a food equity index with a dashboard that would help them better distribute resources, anticipate and plan for changes in supplies and need, and maximize volunteer availability. They also used the data to help create a customer relationship management system for working with their partners. Elsewhere, the team focused on building the capabilities of the organization’s 20-plus warehouse employees. “There was a tremendous variance in skills and experience, from highly capable high school grads to senior logistics experts on second careers,” explains Roberto. “ McKinsey Academy delivered training on supply chain fundamentals, such as choosing the right indicators to create more efficiency.” Additional courses covered how to manage inventory, organize supply flows, and orchestrate distribution. Food security and the coronavirus crisis: A view from Feeding America’s COO With the onset of COVID-19, the training was converted to a virtual format and scaled throughout the Feeding America food bank network. After successful pilots in states including Florida and Idaho, it is now ramping up to additional cities across U.S. “At the food bank in Florida, the local team rearranged the floor layout and workflow in a matter of days; usually it would take weeks,”  says Roberto. “In most transformation work, we need a ‘change story’—the rationale for rethinking processes,” he adds. “The food banks are so eager for change, they don’t need the ‘why,’ and the speed of implementation is very high. It’s incredibly inspiring for everyone involved.” related Pradeep Prabhala: Fighting hunger today and strengthening food security for the long term Never miss a story"
The Davos Agenda: What we shared and heard,The virtual event gathered 1500 global leaders for hundreds of discussions around the theme &ldquo;A crucial year to rebuild trust.&rdquo;,2021-01-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20davos%20agenda%20what%20we%20shared%20and%20learned/wefherosmall11565403111198004281536x864.jpg,Davos,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-davos-agenda-what-we-shared-and-learned,"The Davos Agenda: What we shared and heard January 31, 2021 The World Economic Forum’s January meeting traded the Swiss Alps for a virtual setting this year, as some 1500 global leaders joined hundreds of online panel discussions for the Davos Agenda . Six McKinsey colleagues were among them: our global managing partner Kevin Sneader, senior partner Cornelius Baur, North America managing partner Liz Hilton Segel, senior partner Dame Vivian Hunt, McKinsey Accelerate global leader Daniel Pacthod, and Asia offices chairman Oliver Tonby. Against the backdrop of the global pandemic, each joined dozens of sessions on urgent matters like climate change, diversity and inclusion, the future of work and manufacturing, and much more. Throughout the week, we also announced new WEF partnerships. We committed to be one of 61 leading organizations that will share metrics focused on “people, planet, prosperity, and governance” as part of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative. And McKinsey became a founding member of the forum’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business initiative, a new global coalition dedicated to fighting racism in the workplace. “McKinsey is proud to be a founding member of this new coalition,” Kevin said of the anti-racism initiative, “that is working to tackle issues of racial injustice in the workplace and identify solutions that work across the globe.” To hear more from Kevin and the rest of our delegation on a Davos like no other, read on. Kevin Sneader Beyond the pandemic itself, one topic dominated the agenda this year, and it’s the same one that held sway a year ago: climate change and the transition to a net zero economy. Of course, January 2020’s momentum around business action to foster a green economy was slowed by the advent of the pandemic. But listening and participating in the many virtual sessions taking place this week leads to a view that there is renewed commitment to ensure a green recovery—even if it may have shades of brown, as the resumption of some activity leads to an emissions rise. This was evident in various sessions. Heads of government lined up to encourage and commit to action. Presidents Macron and Xi along with Chancellor Merkel used their remarks to urge multilateral action. Asset owners such as Larry Fink made sweeping commitments to push for institutions to take action and put their own houses in order. And CEOs responded with much discussion of the paths they would take to ensure they helped achieve the Paris climate accords or better. Placing gender parity at the heart of the recovery Of course, many other topics occupied the minds of those who joined the week’s hundreds of panels. I participated in a conversation around gender parity, while sustainable consumption was another topic that seemed to fill many hours of the agenda. It was a very different Davos. The face-to-face time gave way to a highly efficient but somewhat cooler set of online discussions. For me, virtual Davos was no substitute for the real thing. Cornelius Baur Appropriately, the global pandemic figured prominently in several discussions, and it became clear that all nations are united in this crisis of a century. There were repeated calls for joint efforts and specifically for multilateralism, which emerged as one of the event’s most popular terms this year. Digital is the essential prerequisite for growth. The South African President spoke about the continent’s hunger for digital, and in India, more than six million people were trained on digital during the pandemic. Meanwhile, accelerating the introduction of industry 4.0 technology raised concerns about a potential uptick in unemployment, which could generate massive public frustration in certain markets. This made the importance of reskilling abundantly clear: at-risk workers must be quickly upskilled and given new hope in these situations. Looking ahead, the consensus seemed to be that 2021 will be a year of two very different phases in Europe and the US: the first, lasting until about midyear, could see slightly negative growth, as further public funding and subsidies continue to roll out in an effort to aid recovery efforts. The second phase, however, should see strong growth, leading to small annualized gains in Europe and slightly larger ones in the US. Liz Hilton Segel As global leaders shared their perspectives on rebuilding in 2021, what I heard louder and with more urgency than ever was the case for investing in people. From a workforce perspective, this means that supporting the wellbeing of employees and investing in the reskilling of workforces is no longer an advantage but rather a requirement to ensure the long-term resilience and growth of global businesses and economies. In a CEO discussion convened by Fortune, we heard from business leaders on the most important changes they are making to emerge stronger from the challenges of the past year. Responses ranged from reskilling and retraining employees to meeting the shifting needs of consumers to fostering a more flexible, empathetic, and connected workforce in our hybrid work world. Elsewhere, conversations covered the new social contract of business and the importance of collaboration at a local level to make a difference. I shared more thoughts on the actions businesses can take to support their employees’ wellbeing on the Davos Agenda blog . As these conversations continue, people must remain the priority. This is how we invest in the future. Vivian Hunt My conversations made clear this week that we are still facing a global crisis on several fronts; we may be over the worst in some cases, but we continue to face huge choices with regards to our shared and interconnected recovery. When it comes to the health of people globally, the steps we take towards a global and equitable vaccine rollout are critical and will have a huge impact. Meanwhile, on the economic front, there has been a huge focus on rebuilding through a stakeholder capitalism lens. The ESG agenda was integrated into all aspects of the Davos Agenda in a way that is unprecedented (at least in my experience). The crisis has created and accelerated inequality in the workplace and beyond, and business leaders have a responsibility to make better choices on inclusive growth, green growth, and strong interconnections globally. McKinsey and World Economic Forum: The Davos Agenda If real progress is to be made on those fronts, metrics will have to matter: And there was a feeling of real responsibility among the delegates this year around the notion of measuring and monitoring our progress. It reminded me of one of my takeaways from last year; when it’s at its best, Davos is a ‘do shop,’ where people set plans in motion, not just a ‘talk shop’. Daniel Pacthod There were several themes that cut across the sessions I joined this week. Many delegates talked about the importance of driving responsible industry transformation as business leaders continue to embrace stakeholder capitalism. There was also a clear desire to accelerate the sustainability transition and become better stewards of our planet. This was most evident in everyone’s anticipation of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this November. Leaders also talked about rethinking economic and social systems to help those who need it most, especially in the form of job creation, and accelerating the tech transformation for the good of society. What happened in the last 12 months in vaccines is remarkable; and while the bio-revolution is the next unlock, the focus has to remain on “tech for the good of society.” Finally, there were discussions on the need for a new multi-lateral system that is fair and takes into account the geopolitical, economic, and human necessities of the 21st century. A key facet of that society would put public trust on the front burner; across all the sessions, public- and private-sector leaders realize the need to re-establish trust and engage the younger generations. Oliver Tonby The mood this week was realistic—everyone had a clear-eyed view of the challenges ahead—but I also heard reasons for hope and optimism. One thing we have seen is the role technology can and does play, not only in combating the pandemic but also in creating further opportunities for growth. In the COVID-19 era, three attributes matter when it comes to business growth. The first is speed. The pace of tech innovation among companies, workers, consumers, and citizens has accelerated. The second is collaboration, which we see in the case of organizations working together to solve big problems. And the third is resilience. The pandemic has created a situation where going forward, it may now be unthinkable to make a big move without first asking an important question: how pandemic-proof is this? Finally, as many of my fellow Davos Agenda attendees have noted, climate change was one of the most talked-about topics over the course of the week. Where government policies around sustainability stall, stakeholders may increasingly turn to business—one of the most trusted institutions in society at the moment—and demand action. related Davos 2020: What mattered Never miss a story"

Founded to serve clients in Formula 1 racing, the firm was acquired by McKinsey in 2015. Based in London, Toby leads a global team of more than 100 data engineers. With the acceleration of digital technology, data plays an increasingly important role in how organizations can operate, improve, and perform. “Rapid digitization has created an explosion of data, and in that, there still remains a lot of untapped value,” Toby says. “Through that data, organizations can get a fact-based view of performance—where things are efficient, or inefficient—in addition to their experiences and gut feelings. We can now combine that to predict how they might perform in the future and optimize for the best performance outcomes.” One of his favorite recent client projects includes partnering with a global financial services company that is now using predictive models to improve insurance claims performance. “We were able to see how the solutions we built, when operationalized, had a direct link to improved customer experience and claims handling,” he says. QuantumBlack is also leveraging its knowledge of data and analytics for a number of pro-bono initiatives, from increasing diversity in the tech sector to supporting efforts to combat climate change. “Data is so closely associated with business performance but we’re finding applications that help us make a positive change in the world.” Toby joined the firm in 2016, though his passion for technology began at the age of 8, when he began experimenting with basic coding in the computer room at his elementary school. “I’d code simple games with a dot moving around,” he remembers. “I have an older brother who shared the same interests, and our family was lucky to have computers growing up, so we were always tinkering with them as a hobby.” In university, Toby studied Latin and Greek, while reading C++ books on the side—“I had a love of languages, whether it was working out grammar in Latin and Greek, or working out logic in coding”—but it was a trip to China that made him consider a career in data. While studying martial arts ­there, Toby helped his instructor create a website on Kung Fu. “It was the first time I was able to apply technology for a specific purpose, to solve a problem, and I enjoyed it so much I thought I should do it more seriously.” Today, as global head of engineering, Toby tries to instill this same problem-solving mentality in his teams. He always gives new joiners the same advice: Don’t just care about the technology. Care about the problems you’re trying to solve. “It can be easy for data practitioners to focus purely on what technology to use, instead of which problems can be solved by technology,” he says. “I remind my team not to lose sight of the latter. We have a real opportunity to help our clients solve their biggest challenges with data.” related Meet CausalNex, our new open-source library for causal reasoning and “what if” analysis Never miss a story"

Photo by Scott McDermott February 9, 2021 Today we launch the fifth and final part of our knowledge partnership with CNBC. In this edition, we focus on resilience with senior partner Katy George, who discusses why organizations need to build resiliency in their operations to prepare for an increasingly disruptive next normal. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on global supply chains, but our research shows that companies can expect to see more shocks ahead—and with more frequency and severity. According to the McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ), companies report that supply chain disruptions lasting a month or more occur almost every four years, resulting in losses worth almost 45 percent of one year’s EBITDA over the course of a decade. We spoke to Katy , who co-leads our global Operations Practice , about what resilience means in the next normal and how organizations can protect themselves against risk. What do we mean by resilience? What does a resilient organization look like? Put simply, resilience—whether in physical supply chains or service delivery—means your organization has the ability to continue operations if there’s some disruption in some part of your value chain. That disruption can range from a supplier no longer having inventory, or suddenly facing a threefold increase in demand from a customer. Resilience is the ability to flex and accommodate that disruption by having redundancy in your supply chain and inventory, and flexibility in your operations so you can switch gears. In the CNBC segment, you share that 90 percent of supply chain leaders said they needed to change their approach after the pandemic. What impact has COVID-19 had on resilience planning among CEOs? Most companies had some kind of business continuity planning effort, where they look for and address vulnerabilities in their operations, but we’ve seen a real step change in how robust those plans need to be and how much value there is in creating a more resilient supply chain. CEOs have really seen that it’s about more than having good plans on paper. We’re also seeing companies become more flexible in how they manage supply chains through digital technology—using autonomous planning techniques, for example, to provide greater visibility and transparency into their operations—or using analytics capabilities to fundamentally change the way they deliver services. These digital technologies were designed to improve productivity, but we’re seeing how they are allowing organizations to operate more flexibly, too. Finally, our MGI research also finds that supply chains are becoming more regional. Even before COVID-19 companies were finding it more economically viable to have nearer sourcing, and I think we’ll see that trend continue. The need for resiliency How can organizations become more resilient? Prior to COVID-19, a lot of companies identified the most strategic components—for example, dual sourcing—and they would create continuity plans around those. But during the pandemic, we saw that a company’s supply chain could be disrupted by something as small as a simple commodity bolt that a company couldn’t get because it came from a supplier halfway around the world. So companies can’t segment like they used to. They have to segment by risk and think about global planning in rigorous way, whether that’s deciding what they make versus buy, or where to locate their excess supply. Elsewhere, we’ve seen how aggressive adoption of new technology is enabling greater flexibility at less cost—companies can produce smaller quantities at less cost and then more easily enable distribution of those goods and services. Through our partnership with the World Economic Forum to look at industrial lighthouses, we saw one company use digital technology to create more flexibility in their assembly line. While the set-up itself looked the same, IoT capability in product components meant that every product that came down the assembly line could have a different configuration. So it’s just as productive as before in terms of cost per unit, but think about how flexible it is that every product is different. And finally, it’s important for CEOs to see that resiliency is a core competency that cannot be underestimated or a priority only in challenging times. End-to-end digital approaches can transform the customer experience and benefit both the financial and cultural value of a company. What’s an example of resilience work we’ve partnered with a client on that really inspires you? I was recently talking to a client I first started working with 10 years ago. At that time, we were helping them understand their supply-chain risk and how to create segments to understand which products were most important to them, not just for financial impact, but also to their reputation and mission, and those three aren’t always the same. The levers 10 years ago were all about where to build excess capacity or where to have dual sourcing—so the organization could be more resilient. What’s interesting to me is that a decade later, we’re still solving some of those challenges, but in a much more holistic way and with an increasingly exciting set of digital solutions. Now, we’re leveraging digital innovation when partnering with the client to redesign how their supply chain operates, and where they can create more transparency on where things sit along the supply chain. That evolution of our resilience work is really inspiring. Tell us about your journey at the firm, where you co-lead our Operations Practice globally. Why is this work important to you? I’ve been at the firm for almost 25 years. I came after completing a PhD in operations management and labor economics, where I looked at the different production systems for a children’s clothing factory, and it was all about productivity versus flexibility. Our MGI work shows manufacturing significantly contributes to productivity growth, so there’s a tremendous opportunity in terms of meeting new customer needs and creating new benchmarks around cost or value.

(Photo of a Generation USA participant in 2019.) February 11, 2021 Our firm believes in the power of work to transform people’s lives and their communities—and that work should equal livelihood: a means to achieve economic security for people and their families. The global pandemic has threatened or eliminated the livelihoods of millions of people, creating an urgent need to address unemployment at a massive scale. McKinsey has long worked in the space of helping businesses and communities successfully adapt to the latest workforce trends and build more inclusive economies.  In 2014, we founded an independent non-profit, Generation , to bridge the gap between employers and young people. Since then, tens of thousands of learners, including older people who need re-skilling for new industries, have successfully completed Generation’s programs all over the world and entered jobs that enable them to live economically secure lives. Now, after more than six years of successful expansion to numerous regions and professions, Generation is poised to help accelerate economic recovery efforts. Today, Generation announced a new funding coalition to deliver even bigger results in fulfilling its mission to create equity in employment opportunity and break down systemic barriers to employment success. As part of this coalition, McKinsey is redoubling its support of Generation and joining forces with organizations including BlackRock, Microsoft, and Verizon. Together, the coalition is committing $77 million in new funding and $50 million in in-kind support. McKinsey will provide more than $30 million in cash and in-kind support over the next two years to support Generation’s growth. The firm has pledged to continue providing fellowship opportunities that enable our top talent to work alongside Generation’s leaders. In addition, as part of McKinsey’s 10 Actions to support racial equity around the world , we have also partnered with Generation USA on a $2 million effort to train and place Black learners in Black-owned small and medium-sized businesses and $250,000 to Generation Brazil to serve Black learners. McKinsey continuously looks to expand our own hiring practices to be more inclusive of different educational and employment pathways, including but not limited to the hiring of Generation graduates. Mona Mourshed, the founding CEO of Generation who previously served as a McKinsey senior partner, applauded the firm’s pledge. “Generation has been able to help people who have the least amount of resources and access to employment opportunities overcome those challenges and gain entry to good jobs,” she said. “We are excited that McKinsey is continuing its support of Generation, joined by these other funders, to help expand our reach to more learners all over the world.” Anne-Marie Frassica is a director at McKinsey and a former Generation fellow. “McKinsey has been with Generation since its very beginning, and I was honored to help the organization during its earliest stages of helping more young people find stable, meaningful employment,” she said. “With the global pandemic calling out how urgently we need to address employment-opportunity inequality, Generation’s work matters more than ever, and we are delighted that we and other funders are able to support Generation to accelerate its global impact.” About McKinsey and Generation Generation is McKinsey’s most ambitious philanthropic investment to transform the lives of people and communities through stable, meaningful employment. Inspired by McKinsey’s research, Generation not only bridges the gap between employee and employer, but aims to transform how everyone in the education to employment equation approaches the goal of employment success. Since 2014, McKinsey has provided approximately $100 million in general operating and in-kind support to help establish Generation as an independent nonprofit and support its geographic expansion. Hundreds of our staff have worked side-by-side with Generation staff, through fellowships and pro bono projects, on a wide range of operational and program initiatives. This flexible support has helped Generation scale across geographies, professions, and learner types and partner with thousands of employers, funders, and nonprofit organizations. To date, almost 40,000 people have graduated from Generation’s programs, often to jobs with significantly higher earnings than what they were able to access before participating in the program. The stories that have emerged from Generation’s work are of the transformed lives of graduates and the overwhelming satisfaction of employers when they hire Generation graduates.

Our analysts grouped 800 occupations across eight countries into ten ‘ work arenas ’ based on the level of physical proximity they require. We evaluated them against over-riding trends—including automation, aging populations, digitization, sustainability, and more—to create the fullest picture possible of how COVID-19 will reshape the ways we work. Three leaders of the research—Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar , and Olivia Robinson —take us inside the report ’ s findings . What did you learn that most surprised you? Susan: When we reflected on what the pandemic is really changing, for the first time what mattered most were the physical characteristics of a job. For instance, did your work include close contact with the public? How many different people do you interact with in a day? Are you in a highly trafficked public location—or a setting with few others? By looking at occupations from that perspective, we could group them in a different way than we traditionally do, either by sector of the economy, like health care, or by type of occupation, like manager. It’s a new dimension to work that becomes very important when we consider the changes going forward. Olivia: One of the most surprising things for me, based on our estimates, is the decline of low-wage jobs. In the past, it was believed there would be a polarization with growth of both higher-wage and lower-wage jobs and the loss of middle-level jobs, partly due to automation. With COVID-related trends, we see an additional decline of lower-wage jobs, and  that nearly all growth is concentrated in higher-paying jobs. If we can enable the skill and occupational transitions so many people will need, they could be set on paths to higher-skilled and better paying work. That’s a good thing—one we hope our research will help to guide. During the pandemic, almost every business scrambled to enable their employees to work remotely. Is working from home here to stay? Susan: Yes and no. The majority of people across industries have no chance to work remotely, but many office workers do. We believe about 25 percent will go to the office a few days a week and work from home the rest. We think this trend may stick; some people report that it can help with work-life balance; some companies are finding that employees can be more productive; and it can save both of those parties money in things like commuting costs for workers and office space for companies. Virtual working also gives people the option to move to smaller cities and the suburbs. At a recent meeting of human resource leaders, many were talking about opening up satellite locations or hubs in different cities to tap into entirely different talent pools. According to the report, one in 16 people will have to change not just jobs but industries. How will they do that? Susan: It won’t be easy. In our research, for example, we take the example of a cashier and map out four possible career pathways: in health care, IT, transportation and delivery, and sales and marketing. After being a cashier, with some training, that person could gain the skills they need to become a call-center representative. From there, if they work in sales-type call center jobs, they might move into a career in marketing and sales outside the call center. Researching and mapping those kind of career paths will be essential for helping people figure out how to get on an upwardly mobile career track. But this is not just up to individuals to figure out. Companies, educators, and policymakers are all going to have to work together to help people identify these career pathways and then create the programs, resources, and reskilling opportunities necessary to make them possible. Possible career pathways from a cashier job to growing, more highly paid occupations We know that reskilling will be critical to helping thousands of people transition from one job to the next. How might that happen at scale? Anu: A number of large companies have invested in different sorts of training and apprenticeship programs, creating upwardly mobile career paths for their employees. For instance, Walmart has more than 200 academies for their associates with training in management, supply chain, and technology.  IBM, Bosch, and Barclays started apprenticeship programs to train workers for tech jobs with career pathways. At the national level, there are lots of examples we can learn from but no one has yet cracked the code. In Singapore, India, and the countries of the EU, we see national platform-based reskilling initiatives, such as using digital learning passes for citizens. But as Susan mentions, people can’t do reskilling alone. We’ve got to take the good ideas that are happening within companies and communities and scale them nationally to include millions of people. People will need shorter term programs to get the basic skills they need for an entry level job in a few weeks—not years—and the learning has to be targeted to the essential tasks for the immediate term, similar to Generation programs. Generation Z workers have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. What advice would you give to someone just starting out? Olivia: I would say, if possible, focus on building skills for jobs that are in growing industries, such as healthcare, tech, engineering, science, and logistics. The good news is that there will also be high growth in jobs that require socio-emotional skills, such as negotiation, influencing, and decision-making. And we may see new positions emerging because of COVID-19, such as remote-work coordinators. Hiring may also be changing. A number of companies are focusing less on degrees and job titles and more on skills assessments. Job platforms are matching candidates with jobs based on skills not past job roles or titles. This can all help open up opportunities and improve mobility. In terms of mindsets, I would recommend against thinking of your education as something that is one day finished, and then you just work. That divide no longer exists; your education never ends. Your career will be about life-long learning across different occupations and industries. Finally, as you look ahead, do you see any silver linings coming out of this crisis? Susan: Most companies are reimagining themselves right now. They are embracing speed and flexibility and agility, and the flattening of hierarchies in an effort to make decisions faster and better. For workers, this can be an opportunity to move onto career pathways that offer greater upward mobility. And for the economy, we could see higher productivity growth if we help workers make those transitions. Never miss a story"
Why sponsorship is key to helping Black employees advance&mdash;and more takeaways from our new research,"Two partners discuss our newest research, which offers a big-picture view and on-the-ground insights about what it means to be a Black employee in the US private sector.",2021-02-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/why%20sponsorship%20is%20key%20to%20helping%20black%20employees%20advance/private-sector-hero-small-155301969-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Organization,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/why-sponsorship-is-key-to-helping-black-employees-advance,"Why sponsorship is key to helping Black employees advance—and more takeaways from our new research February 22, 2021 In a sense, Monne Williams’ work on our latest research began back in 2006, when she was the marketing manager for Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox. “We were only one mile from a historically Black neighborhood, but we had a lot of challenges attracting a diverse fan base,” she recalls. “We focused on building our internal diversity, doing multicultural marketing with events such as ‘Latino Family Festival,’ and promoting through social media. We were learning about, and solving, diversity problems we didn’t even know we had.” Monne joined McKinsey in 2012 and now helps organizations through major transformations by focusing on organizational health , capability building, and culture change. Over the last year, she led our new research, Race in the workplace: The Black experience in the US private sector , along with Bryan Hancock , the global leader of our Talent Practice and an expert on the future of work . The report offers a first-time look at both the big-picture trends of Black workers in the private sector as well as insights from their day-to-day experiences, based on input from some 25,000 employees. What stands out to you personally in the findings? Monne: Black employees are seeing companies saying the right things, making public announcements and monetary commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, but they perceive that the execution is lacking. Black employees leave entry-level jobs at higher rates than white employees, and they make up only seven percent of managers. Two-thirds of all employees, including Black employees, report having no sponsors. So while intentions are there, traction and results aren’t. What struck me is how similar the experiences of Black employees are in the day-to-day.  Many feel that they are working with managers who aren’t experienced at leading diverse teams; they do not feel that diversity is valued nor that the systems around evaluation and promotion are fair. They feel as if they can’t be their full selves. One focus group participant was told that he was being too professional and needed to lighten up. He didn’t know what to do with that feedback and feared that by acting “less professional” he would then be perceived as less competent. This is consistent with much of the research on code switching . Many feel that their peer relationships are transactional and that there may be negative consequences if they share their experiences as Black employees.  This all adds up to the sense that when you come to work, you can’t be your full self—and this experience was consistent. What advice do you have for a manager on helping his or her diverse team thrive? Bryan: One of the most valuable things a manager does is to give feedback.  Managers should not shy away from giving feedback to Black colleagues because of a fear of “saying the wrong thing.”   A manager needs to describe, and provide feedback on, the specific behaviors, knowledge, skills, and experiences Black team members need to succeed.   Be very intentional and concrete on steps, and then follow-up regularly. There are certain things a manager can do to help people fit in team settings. Create a space for everyone to contribute.  Seek input from each person in the room when it’s a critical topic.  And make a point as a team to discuss diversity as a topic. When planning social activities, make sure you have input from everyone on how to connect and celebrate and socialize. No one is naturally good at these conversations. It requires a level of vulnerability in leaders to admit they don’t know exactly what to say. You have to have a learning mindset. Ask a lot of questions. Don’t worry about well-intended mistakes. This is what we are trying to help organizations with. Race in the workplace: The Black experience in the US private sector We see progress on hiring Black employees in entry-level roles but little in advancement to management. How can we improve this? Bryan: We need more sponsors; fewer than a third of Black workers report having sponsors, and fewer than 25 percent report receiving “quite a bit” or “a lot” of support to make it to the next level.  Sponsorship is more than meeting for an occasional coffee—it’s about providing honest coaching and feedback, creating career opportunities, and raising their name and profile when openings are being discussed at the senior level. Monne: There is also an analytics element. When you are managing thousands of people on the front end of your talent pipeline, you need to invest more in data-based talent processes to help assess, manage, and advance people. Geography plays a critical role in race and economic opportunity. Can you explain a bit about this? Bryan: Yes, I was surprised at how critical geography is as a factor. Fewer than one in 10 Black workers in the private sector live in the fastest growing, most-dynamic places, such as Austin, Texas, or Provo, Utah.   If you don't live where the high value jobs are, and are growing, that’s an immediate setback. We are seeing some positive change however, as a result of the increased virtual working during the pandemic.  It’s giving companies a chance to rethink their footprints, and consider whether some jobs, which might have historically been at headquarters, could be located in more diverse locations. How much can companies actually achieve when it comes to promoting diversity and inclusion in society? Monne: A company can do a lot within its own four walls, but to address broader challenges—such as creating jobs, improving transportation, and other infrastructure challenges—and maximizing philanthropic resources, it will need to develop partnerships with business councils, local government agencies, and non-profits. You can’t do this alone. Bryan: Diversity programs should not all be the same. A high-tech company in Silicon Valley will have different diversity aspirations and context than say, a chemicals manufacturer in Oklahoma. A leader should be asking: “Given my geography, my industry, my location: what are the best ways for me to build a more diverse workforce?” related Our Black Voices: The journey to capture the perspectives of McKinsey’s Black colleagues How we’re building the next generation of Black executive leaders Never miss a story"

Still, the idea of pausing to reset was not something that occurred to Hamad. As a leader, he had never felt like he could afford to. But one day during a one-on-one coaching session he realized that burning the candle from both ends does not, in fact, give a lovely light. “If you let all that pressure build up, you become the type of team leader that can't actually lead,” he says. “I knew something had to change.” He’s not usually a person who shares too much about his struggles—“I don’t like to get emotional”—but after that session, Hamad knew he needed a different approach. “I realized how important it is to take a break to clear your mind so you can come back to your challenges stronger, and with a fresh perspective.” Hamad is one of 20 participants who recently graduated from Qiyada Emerging Leaders . McKinsey colleagues together with Aberkyn , a McKinsey company, created the year-long leadership development program as a pro-bono effort to empower and inspire the next generation of purpose-driven leaders in Abu Dhabi. The UAE’s capital is undergoing a massive economic and social transformation. But today, Emiratis still make up less than 10 percent of its private-sector workforce. “There’s a wealth of local talent waiting for an opportunity to contribute to the massive transformation happening here,” says Rima Assi , a senior partner and managing partner of McKinsey's Abu Dhabi office. After launching in 2020, the program welcomed its second class of participants this month. “The importance of local talent in helping drive this transformation cannot be overstated,” says Maitham Albaharna, a partner based in the Dubai office, and one of the program’s main architects. Maitham moved back to the region shortly before the 2008 financial collapse—and saw firsthand the abrupt exodus of talent as the economic crisis worsened. “While it is important to attract diverse global talent, it is critical that we ensure we are building the next generation of local talent and leaders who will play a pivotal role in growing the economy,” he says. Last February, the initial program kicked off with 20 participants—each a manager with three to 12 years of professional experience—who attended in-person workshops and day-long immersions sessions on topics like communicating with impact. They also took part in one-on-one coaching sessions, and hands-on, role play-led training. In March, the program quickly pivoted to online-only learning as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. For some participants, the chance to learn from like-minded peers was the most rewarding part of the program. “I’d never had the chance to talk to so many other young professionals who were facing the same challenges as me,” says Hamad. “The ability to speak candidly without judgment, and know that everything was going to stay in that room, was something I’ll never forget.” There’s a wealth of local talent waiting for an opportunity to contribute to the massive transformation happening here. The vulnerability of participants was also something that stayed with Maitham. “In our culture, we typically shy away from exposing our fears or weaknesses,” he said. “It was incredibly inspiring to watch these people share their stories and connect over how they were experiencing similar feelings and emotions—it was a completely different kind of bond.” Rawan Albina, Aberkyn’s hub leader in the Middle East, says Qiyada is unique in its blend of human-focused leadership training with data-driven insights McKinsey has learned from its global work with top-performing teams. “The program allows participants to develop both their heads and hearts as leaders,” she says. “It’s important for us to help these young professionals appreciate how their personality, background, and experiences inform how they lead, make decisions, and interact with others.” And while the COVID-19 outbreak meant the program had to move online, the pandemic allowed participants to apply their recent learnings on a real-life challenge. “We had just discussed the importance of being an adaptive leader—and then the pandemic forced our young talent to really examine what that meant,” says Rawan. “They also had to learn how to use Zoom in a professional environment, like many of us at the time, and discover how to create impact and connection in a virtual setting.” Participant Reem Al Zaabi, senior assistant manager at Mubadala, the UAE sovereign wealth fund, heard about Qiyada through her manager. She says the biggest unlock of the program was realizing strong leadership begins with self-awareness. “The journey I went through was something that fundamentally changed the way I listen to others, respond to their feedback, and influence others,” she says. “I’ve learned to appreciate and really believe that understanding  every team member’s perspective and background can help us collectively reach greater impact.” That change is something Reem’s manager, Fatima Al Marzouqi, a senior vice president of development, notices, too. “Reem’s development and growth during the program is evident to everyone working with her,” Fatima says. “She has always been self-driven, however, over the duration of the course, she learned how to communicate more clearly with her team and leadeship and became more agile with existing and new projects.” Qiyada Emerging Leaders Never miss a story"

Capability building during COVID-19: 6 experts on the skill they&rsquo;re most excited to help teams develop,The rapid pace of transformation ushered in by the pandemic has meant organizations need to adapt faster than ever before&mdash;and develop the right skills to sustain that change.,2021-03-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/capability%20building%20during%20covid%2019/capabilitybuilding-hero-small-1196304468-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Capability Building",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/capability-building-during-covid-19,"Capability building during COVID-19: 6 experts on the skill they’re most excited to help teams develop March 5, 2021 The rapid pace of transformation ushered in by the pandemic has meant organizations need to adapt faster than ever before—and develop the right skills to sustain that change. Here, six McKinsey experts share the capabilities they’re most excited to develop with teams—and why these skills are critical for staying ahead in the next normal. Kate Lazaroff Puck on adaptability and resilience “The skill of surfing the waves is so important right now,” says Kate, a solution leader based in Boston. “We’re all experiencing dramatic stress during the pandemic, which makes us ineffective collaborators and uncreative problem solvers.” As one of the leaders of McKinsey Academy’s Adaptability and Resilience program, Kate works with leaders to get more productivity—and happiness—out of the same input of energy, time, and effort. “We’re improving the engine,” she says. While this kind of skill is typically taught to CEOs, Kate says we launched this offering in part because we saw how pervasive the negative toll of stress was at every level of the organization. In fact, one aspect of the program focuses on social learning, where different groups of employees share best practices. “It’s about normalizing talking about this,” Kate says. “Navigating stress is a life skill, and every person brings different perspective—and wisdom.” Andrea Alexander on remote working “A year ago, the pandemic forced almost all organizations to work remotely, and in the beginning it was about survival,” says Andrea, an associate partner based in Houston. “Leaders were just trying to figure it out, while grappling with all the other changes brought on by the pandemic.” A year later, many executives are focused on how to optimize remote work—so teams aren’t spending days on back-to-back video conferences—or navigate what a hybrid workplace will look like in the next normal. “Executives are realizing their teams can’t just keep running on adrenaline, so we’re helping them learn how to effectively manage remotely in this phase—when they should actually use Zoom versus asynchronous communication—and for a world that we know is increasingly going to be more virtual and hybrid,” Andrea says. Naveed Rashid on digital literacy “The pandemic underscored that digital literacy is important for everyone to have,” says Naveed, a senior solution leader based in New York. “It’s not just the leaders and teams who are driving digital transformation, but also the broader organization, who needs to feel vested, inspired, and empowered to learn and contribute.” And while digital literacy is often discussed in the context of technology-enabled transformation at businesses, Naveed says the skill applies in life, too. “Just think about the migration to Zoom and the use of other digital tools during the pandemic—that’s its own kind of transformation.” Naveed is particularly inspired by this kind of capability building work because of the potential for sustained impact. “It’s very energizing work because it’s people-focused,” he says. “There’s nothing more rewarding than helping an organization’s people learn new skills, grow their knowledge, and unlock their potential.” Olga Nefedova on execution excellence As COVID-19 has accelerated the pace at which leaders need to make decisions, execution excellence has become a key capability for organizations, says Olga, an expert associate partner based in London. “The key to execution excellence is understanding where impact is coming from, not just the actions themselves,” she says. As Olga explains, any organization can implement a set of measures and check the box—only to see zero impact. “If you train every person on a team on new software that’s rolling out, but the employees don’t understand how that software implementation supports the organization’s strategy, or where the value in that new software lies, then that effort is unlikely to make a difference,” she says. “It’s important for leaders to ensure there’s a direct link from their vision to the action, so execution can be broken down into meaningful steps.” Fleur Tonies on well-being “It is so great to see organizations begin to recognize well-being as a capability one can build this last year, as opposed to a trait that leaders have or don’t have,” says Fleur, an associate leader at Aberkyn, a McKinsey company, who is based in Singapore. “We saw COVID-19 affect so many ‘healthy’ people that it really forced a mind shift in what we think well-being is. More executives are understanding that impactful leadership means leading by example—balancing physical health, the body;  mental health, the mind; and purpose, the soul.” About Aberkyn Aberkyn , a firm of experts in leadership development and cultural transformation, was acquired by McKinsey in 2017. Its work with leaders, teams and organizations integrates the latest organizational science, ancient wisdom and pragmatic business practices. To help leaders build and strengthen their well-being, Aberkyn leaders often start by asking one ‘simple’ question, such as “How are you, really?” in addition to leveraging more advanced, medical diagnostic tools. “Ultimately, our goal is to help leaders become aware of their behaviors, develop better practices, and commit to developing them,” Fleur says. “As we believe, healthy leaders lead healthier teams and create healthy organizations.” Anant Kasibhatla on inspiring leadership More than a year into the pandemic, we’ve seen just how important inspiring leadership has been when it comes to how well organizations have weathered the crisis, says Anant, an associate leader at Aberkyn, a McKinsey Company, who is based in Mumbai. The first and foremost characteristic of inspiring leaders today? Empathy. “This has always been important for leaders, but as we’ve all seen our colleagues’ kids on Zoom, or had to cancel a meeting to take care of a family member, and heard colleagues express other challenges related to the pandemic—empathy has really become critical for the day to day.” Another critical trait for inspiring leaders? The ability to balance a telescopic and microscopic view. “The pandemic has taught us that optimism is not going to work anymore,” he says. “Increasingly, we’re working with leaders to continue to aspire for the best outcome—but prepare for the worst, whether that’s through pre-mortem exercises or risk-mitigation simulations.” related Need to make a tough decision?

In our Women in the Workplace research last year 1 in 4 of them said they were considering taking a step back in their careers or leaving the workforce entirely. A year after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, we’re talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work over the last year—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the last 12 months have shaped their outlook on life and work. Here, Margret-Ann Natsis, a media relations specialist based in Amsterdam, talks about starting a new job, while raising a new baby, during lockdown. On starting a new job and onboarding during the crisis A year ago I was just starting at the firm. I was also a new mom to a six-month old boy at the time. I had done my week of onboarding and was set to travel to London two weeks later to meet some of my team members and do some kickoff meetings. Three days before travel, I got the dreaded call: “ It looks like this isn’t going to happen. ” I had been anticipating that, but was still hopeful because, at that moment, nobody really knew how intense this was going to be. I was really sad that the trip wasn’t able to work out. But that was definitely the moment when it was like, “ Okay, this is happening. I’m now working from home.” I’d only been in the office nine days before I was sent home with a laptop. On missing family and raising a new baby amid lockdown We are expats so we don’t live by family. We had these trips planned to meet family here in Europe, or for us to go back with our son to the United States, and those were canceled.  When you have a little one you’re really looking forward to that time with the grandparents for the baby—but  honestly also for you. We’re very fortunate. We have a great community here and friends who want to help out. But those first few months were tough because we were also trying to figure out, you know, what should we be doing? What shouldn’t we be doing? At the beginning it didn’t really hit me. But by mid-summer, I started to struggle more with missing family and honestly wishing for a little bit of a break. And an opportunity for my husband and I to spend time without the baby. When daycares opened back up in the Netherlands I definitely felt relief. On the importance of having one hour a day to herself The number one thing that I’ve held onto, and thankfully I have a very supportive partner, is that I need at least an hour a day where I can exercise, even if that’s going on a walk by myself. But I really love to run. My husband and I have made a promise that I will have that time everyday to myself because I really do notice it makes me a better mom. It makes me a better wife—just a better-rounded version of myself. On learning to lose pride and not being afraid to ask for help What the pandemic has brought to light for me is that we’re all in different situations. You don’t know what others are going through. It's best if we can just be there for one another—colleagues, friends, or family—and be unassuming and know that we need to lean on one another. Also to not be apologetic in asking for help. There have been times where I’ve reached out to a girlfriend and been like, “ Is there any way  you can watch my son for the afternoon? I just need a minute.” And the positive responses have opened my eyes to the fact that folks want to help. Just like I want to help the person next to me. This year has definitely allowed me to lose a little bit of pride and say, “ Hey, I need a hand. I need a hand today. ” Never miss a story"

In our Women in the Workplace research last year 1 in 4 of them told us they were considering taking a step back in their careers or leaving the workforce entirely. A year after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, we’re talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work over the last year—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the last 12 months have shaped their outlook on life and work. This week, Amandla Ooko-Ombaka, an associate partner based in Nairobi, talks about managing teams and a long-distance relationship during the lockdown and how a commitment to early-morning workouts has made all the difference to her well-being and health. On the exact moment when the crisis became real I love food, so I do all my work in agriculture and food—everything across the value chain from working with
governments that are helping farmers be more productive and earn a dignified living, all the way to supporting
fast-food restaurants and grocery stores, where consumers like you and me buy food. I believe strongly in the
power of agriculture and food to transform Africa, so last February, I went to Boston for the Harvard Africa
Business Conference to speak on a panel on these very topics. My partner, who lives in Seattle, met me and said, “ Look, Amandla, do you want to go
back with some masks? This crisis is just starting to emerge. ” There were about eight cases in Boston at the
time.  I was like, “ No way; we totally have masks and PPE in Kenya. We’ll be fine. ” A month later, when we had our first COVID-19 case in Kenya, is when I think it really hit me. Even as I saw the
shutdowns across Europe and the U.S., I initially thought there was no way that the outbreak was going to
affect what was going on here. But then we started pulling teams off projects, including a team in Ghana that
needed to be in markets interacting with distributors and vendors every day. That’s when I thought, “ Yup, this
is probably going to last much longer than I had originally anticipated. ” At that moment, I knew it wasn’t just
going to change our lives personally or how we at the firm work, but it was going to  change how our clients really
thought about the next year. On finding unexpected joys in a challenging year I bought a new mattress. I hadn’t spent that much time in my bed over the past four years. I actually got a call
from the ministry. They mentioned I’d not been in Kenya for more than two consecutive weeks the year
before, so they were asking what business I was doing here. But it’s been a really pleasant shift. Now that I’m working from home, I know all the grocery delivery people. I know the timing of everything that happens in my
neighborhood. If you need some gossip in my neighborhood, I am your gal, which is a very different life
experience than before the pandemic when I was traveling so much. It’s allowed me to focus on
my health. My brain wakes up at 10:00 a.m. But I am in the gym by 5:30 or 6:30 every morning. No matter what happens the rest of the day, by 7:00 a.m., I’ve accomplished one thing—and no one can take that away from me. On navigating the disruption caused by the pandemic Because I have teams in five different time zones, it means I’m sometimes up at 5:00 a.m. for calls, and other times I’m up at
midnight to support them. I’m in a long-distance relationship, and that works really nicely when you can
travel. It’s terrible when you can’t travel. He’s more than 9,000 miles away from Nairobi. We talk twice a day.
Just saying good night or good morning and hearing how each other’s days were has been quite important. But I’m very lucky because I still have a job. I’ve had zero concern about my job security this entire period of the crisis.
I’ve never worried about what I’m going to eat and have been fortunate not to have had any personal health concerns. And, you know, if
something were to go wrong, I fully trust and believe in the firm’s systems and
protocols. So despite my tough times being bad for me, I’m just very conscious of
other people who have it infinitely worse—those who aren’t sure if they are going to make it through the next
week, let alone  the next year. On the lessons she’ll take forward from the last year One of the things I’ve taken advantage of, and I wish I’d done it earlier, is Mind Matters, a mental health offering at the firm. I didn’t realize how much stress the pandemic had put on
me until one of our HR managers told me, “ Amandla, you need to talk to someone. ” And I was like, “ I don’t need
to talk to anybody. I’m fine. ” I was not fine. But the pandemic has changed my life in so many ways. I’ve been part of so many incredible conversations about the impact of COVID-19 on the continent. I don’t know what's going to stay here in this new normal. What I do know is: My head sits on top of my body, right? So I need to take care of my body. I need to sleep. I need to eat. I need to work out. All those things are important whether I’m at McKinsey or not. So making sure I take care of myself and taking it back to basics is really important in this next phase of life.

Meet our next global managing partner: Bob Sternfels,The California native has led our global client capabilities network for the past several years. He will become the 13th leader of McKinsey since our 1926 founding.,2021-03-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/meet%20our%20next%20global%20managing%20partner%20bob%20sternfels/bob-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,"Managing Partner,Our People,Global Managing Partner",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-our-next-global-managing-partner-bob-sternfels,"Meet our next global managing partner: Bob Sternfels March 10, 2021 Every three years, our senior partners elect one of their peers to serve as global managing partner. The role is unlike that of a corporate CEO (for example, individuals serve a maximum of two, three-year terms) but the managing partner makes key leadership appointments and plays an important part in shaping McKinsey’s direction. Bob Sternfels has been elected as our next global managing partner. When his first term begins on July 1, he will become the thirteenth leader of McKinsey since our 1926 founding. A senior partner who has worked with colleagues in nearly all of our 130+ offices around the world, Bob focuses on expanding McKinsey’s capabilities in digital and advanced analytics, while ensuring we continue to answer our clients’ most urgent needs amid times of rapid upheaval. We spoke with Bob about his life and work—and how he plans to help McKinsey continue moving forward. Where did you grow up? I grew up in place called Lodi, which is a fairly small agricultural town in northern California. How did your upbringing shape your outlook? Lodi at that time still had a tailwind from California’s growth boom in the 1950s and 1960s. Although it was a lower-middle income town, there was this feeling that you could achieve anything if you put your mind to it. I guess that stayed with me. I’m an optimist. I believe in potential. Does that sense of optimism influence your leadership style? I think so. My starting place is that we are a firm of leaders , and the partnership model works because we all assume the mantle of leadership as a governing thought. But do you really lead leaders? Or do you inspire and enable them? I aim for the latter. People describe you as organized, proactive, and a systems-thinker. They also say you’re very direct. Is that fair? I think that’s too generous! If I had to describe myself, I might go back to this notion of enabling people and what it takes to do so. I think part of that is being direct, and I would say that I’m pretty direct. I’ve always liked the saying, “Do what you say, and say what you mean.” Aside from that, I really believe in distributed leadership and empowerment. We are a global firm that works in local contexts, and I think this notion of trust and empowerment enables speed. Speeding things up can make them riskier. There’s been speculation in the press that your election is a reaction to the tighter client selection and risk management processes adopted by the firm over the last three years. How do you respond? I reject that narrative. I’ve spoken to many of my fellow senior partners, and I don’t sense that there’s a rejection of our journey to work more responsibly. These reforms are not the work of any individual. They were voted on and agreed to by a body of senior partners, of which I’m a part. I also reject the “or” in this notion that you can have a faster or safer firm. I believe you can have a faster and safer firm, and I think the origins of how you square that get into design. I come from an operations background; if you get the design of a product right, you don’t have to do recalls and modifications and so forth—it just works. I think that's our next horizon: as we innovate, we create a firm that gets it right first time, as opposed to trying to figure it out later. Leadership change, a global pandemic, and questions about the firm’s reputation and the work we do. What will it take for McKinsey to get this moment right? I am determined to use this moment to make our partnership stronger, more inclusive, and better able to help our clients thrive in a fast-changing world. And I’m committed to build on the important changes that Kevin Sneader helped launch and our partnership embraced—and on the good work our firm does with our clients and in society. You’re about to step into a hugely demanding role. What will energize you? The thing that gives me the most energy every day is thinking about how I can help our clients—not whatever leadership role I’m playing in the firm. I expect that to continue.  We take on leadership roles at McKinsey because it’s an obligation not because it’s a desire. How are you thinking about advancing the progress we’ve made on diversity and inclusion? First, I’m eager to build on the progress we’re making through initiatives like the Institute for Black Economic Mobility and our 10 Actions to combat racism in the workplace. Diversity and inclusion shouldn’t be treated as a separate initiative—it must be embedded into everything we do. We need better mentorship among diverse groups to unlock phenomenal client leaders, and we want to focus on all of this as a signature process around everything we do when it comes to our people. I plan to spend time looking across our processes, from evaluations to apprenticeship to leadership appointments, to ensure we are following through on our commitment to be an unrivaled environment for all of our people. You played water polo at Stanford University. What did that experience teach you? One of the great lessons I’ve learned is that irrespective of talent mix on a team you have to  figure out how to work as a unit. A unit that works together that may not have a superstar can beat a unit that has a superstar but is not working as a team. This notion that a great team can beat great talent has stayed with me. And, you know, sports aren’t easy—and water polo in particular is a pretty difficult sport, so there’s a resilience aspect. You will have setbacks. Leadership isn’t about avoiding setbacks—it’s about knowing how to pick yourself and others back up when you run into them. What do you do outside of work? My wife and I have three children, and I love to spend time with my family. I also love to fly. Both granddads were pilots in the Second World War and my dad was a pilot and had a small plane growing up. I started flying about 10 years ago. It's a wonderful stress-reliever. Finally, how do you like to start your day? I hit the gym, or run, or swim. I always start with some form of exercise. My wife and I used to run ultra-marathons. These days my knees can’t take the mileage, so I need to be more varied.  I try to keep up with her on the road at the weekends, but that is proving harder and harder to do. Never miss a story"
Mapping the Black experience in film and TV,"Meet Nony Onyeador, a McKinsey consultant and writer at heart whose research aims to help create change in the entertainment industry.",2021-03-11T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/inside%20hollywood%20the%20black%20experience%20in%20film%20and%20tv/racehollywood-hero-fullcol-1248972919-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Our Publishing,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/inside-hollywood-the-black-experience-in-film-and-tv,"Mapping the Black experience in film and TV March 11, 2021 Nony Onyeador, a McKinsey engagement manager, comes from an extended Nigerian family and grew up in Los Angeles.  She earned an MBA from UC Berkeley after studying urban studies and creative writing at the University of Pennsylvania. She’s had a special interest in coming-of-age stories ever since. “ I like to write about the relationships and experiences that make us who we are,” she says, “ the friends and family who get us from point A to B, and help us navigate the turning points in life.” Nony is also hoping that her most recent consulting work, a research project on the Black experience in Hollywood, proves to be a turning point of sorts. She and a small team developed an extensive fact base by analyzing industry data sets and reports; conducting focus groups and more than 50 one-on-one interviews; and mapping the journeys of Black professionals in the industry. The work captured the Black experience of working in Hollywood, both on screen and off-screen, from project conception through the creation, production, distribution, and promotion of shows and films. They then identified potential solutions and detailed a road map of actions for developing greater diversity across TV and film. “ Entertainment is one of the most complex and powerful industries in our society because it is visible to everyone,” Nony observes. “ It creates our narrative and can only be made richer by providing access to all voices. It’s very exciting to have these findings and hopefully use them to help create change.”  Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Nony. Let’s start on a personal note: what is your favorite TV show or movie that you've watched during quarantine? Without a doubt, “ I May Destroy You. ” I wish I wrote it myself.  It's very high-quality writing  and directing, and it shows Michaela Coel’s incredible range. As a writer, how did you get into consulting? I always thought of myself as a writer with a business bug. Consulting is a lot like writing a mystery or figuring out a puzzle: you have to solve a problem. I went to business school but always wanted to find my way to the creative side of business—entertainment. This project brought together the two interests. How did McKinsey get involved in this project? The entertainment industry has been changing very rapidly, so there's room for consultants to help Hollywood businesses grow, incorporate data into those processes, and attract and retain viewers and talent.  For this project, a McKinsey alum, Franklin Leonard , founder of The Black List, has been deeply involved in conversations about race and representation in Hollywood. He is part of the BlackLight Collective, a coalition of Black leaders, artists, and executives who work in varied capacities across the film and TV industry. They focus on what Hollywood could do to become more racially inclusive as both a workplace and in providing economic opportunities. There had been some progress, but the collective was convinced that their argument would be best made if it was supported by a highly analytical framework provided by a third party. At the same time, Franklin had seen our firm's commitment to combating racism through our 10 actions and reached out. Our first step was to create a structured, factual baseline about where the industry is today and then map a potential path forward. This work wasn’t far off for me in the consulting context. Prior to this, I served a major studio, advising a on a variety of topics, including how to navigate the complexities of marketing a Black-led film. It’s a topic I care deeply about. The research highlights how different Hollywood and entertainment is from other industries. That's right. The industry was started with a few, powerful, mostly white men, who created companies that are tightly interconnected; they tended to hire people they knew, who also mostly happened to be white. Our research finds that hasn’t changed much. A majority of work takes place in small, informal settings on location, without the accountability of structures such as a consistent culture or an HR presence. People work on a contractual, temporary basis. Every project is very expensive so there is a perception of high risk in doing something different, such as hiring a more diverse crew or talent. The structures and focus that other industries can bring to diversifying their workforces are much more elusive in Hollywood. Black representation in Film and TV: The challenges and impact of increasing diversity Can you share a bit about the findings? We mapped out the entire content development process and talked to people who were writers, agents, showrunners, directors, producers, actors, investors. The bottom line is that Black people and their stories are stifled and under-valued at every point of the ecosystem. What has to happen to create change? Overall, there’s an opportunity for the industry to increase the number of Black participants across all levels of the industry including leadership. This includes attracting the next generation as well as creating an environment that encourages Black professionals to remain part of the business today. It also means increasing participation in the economics of entertainment, including salaries, production budgets, and project investments. To do this, the entire industry must lock hands on this goal and the subsequent solutions. Unlike other industries, the complexity and interconnectivity in Hollywood means that any one company or individual acting alone is insufficient to drive sustainable progress. Secondly, it is important to define and track the metrics of success so that companies are held to consistent standards for how they hire and promote, and so that they have a target to drive toward. A bit more ambiguous is the need to broaden the scope of the Black stories that are told:  does this mean having a Black lead actor? Having more Black people behind the scenes? Is it stories about the Black experience that are different from what is out there now?  Can we rethink the types of stories that are told and interpret genres in new ways? For example, “ Bridgerton ” brought in a new racial perspective with Black characters in a period drama. You talked to a lot of people in the industry. What were those conversations like? People were really grateful for the chance to speak in an external setting and think through the issue of racial diversity in a structured way. It’s not the way they typically do things. They are often working on a very specific project, and don’t have access to the big picture. Plus, race is a thorny and sensitive topic, so they were happy to have a chance to share their truths openly. Of the many themes, across the board participants believed that there are no clear criteria or metrics which could define whether they were doing a good job, could be promoted, or move to another position. There’s no consistent definition of what “good” looks like. This is where inequity is often likely to stem from. And our work, we hope, will start to change this. What did you personally learn from this project? I have to be true to myself. My passion lies with storytelling, which is about helping people to amplify their voices, whether it's in a film, in the media, or in something like McKinsey consulting. I learned by working with clients across other industries that the benefit McKinsey brings is about identifying the problem, structuring it logically, and chasing it. But entertainment is all about thinking out of the box in storytelling. Bringing these elements together was the best of the best—and really exciting. Never miss a story"

In our Women in the Workplace research last year, 1 in 4 of them said they were considering taking a step back in their careers or leaving the workforce entirely. A year after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, we’re talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work over the last year—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the last 12 months have shaped their outlook on life and work. Here, Sarah Mulligan, a communications manager based in New York City, talks about giving birth during the pandemic, navigating grief, and returning to work with a new outlook on life. On navigating the changes of the last year: It has been extraordinary in every positive and negative way imaginable. I was pregnant during the pandemic, and working while parenting my two-year-old, until I had my second child at the end of August. I still think it's very funny that I labored and gave birth to my daughter wearing a mask. At one point, I pulled down my mask to breathe better while having a contraction and the nurse said to me, “Honey, I need to ask you to put that back on.” I will never forget that moment and being so upset—and in pain! The last year has been extremely challenging, but I also spent more intimate, one-on-one time with my family than I would have otherwise, which I loved and cherished. On the lived experience of COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on Asian-Americans and other communities of color: It hit our South Asian community pretty hard. My grandmother was in a rehab facility from the beginning of 2020 recovering from a stroke. When lockdowns began in March, we couldn’t see her. Like a lot of South Asians, I grew up with my grandparents living with me, so I was very close to her. She didn’t have a smartphone and she didn’t speak English, so we were relying on the kindness of nurses to get updates or—if we were very lucky—to video chat with her. It was a horrific time, and we were always bracing ourselves that she would contract COVID-19 at some point because this was at the height of the pandemic, and so much was still so unknown about the disease that all of us were too scared to bring her back home. She then got COVID-19 in April, was hospitalized in an isolation unit in a hospital for a week, and miraculously beat it at 86 years old. I recently lost two uncles to COVID-19, one in Montreal and one in Dubai. They were both beautiful people, so vibrant and full of life. Because of the pandemic, I couldn’t be at their funerals or be with family. This distance has added another layer to such devastating and premature losses. Cumulatively, my family knows about a dozen acquaintances and relatives who have contracted COVID-19, many of whom have passed away. On finding hope during the most difficult parts of the last year: Whenever I feel upset about something, I try to remember to count my blessings. At least I have a backyard for my kids. At least my mom and siblings are in my social bubble, so we see them frequently and they’re able to help with childcare. I have a supportive and loving partner. I think I was also lucky my children weren’t in school yet. I really cannot imagine having to balance multiple kids, a dual-career household, and school schedules on top of that. I think the parents who do, especially moms who often carry a disproportionate amount of responsibility in a household, deserve medals. I’m actually reading Option B by Sheryl Sandberg. It's this book she wrote on grief after she lost her husband suddenly in 2015. One of the things that she and psychologist Adam Grant talk about is when you have gone through trauma or you are grieving something, try and think about how it could've been worse, because what that forces you to do is be grateful for what you have, even when you’re going through something difficult. I’m grateful that my young children encourage me to be emotionally present, healthy, and
calm. I still find pockets of peace and true joy every day because of them. On how the pandemic has changed her outlook on life: Life is so delicate. I think I’ve always known this in general terms, but what’s shifted is that I don’t think there’s any time to waste. I approach life with such urgency now. The second I’m able to travel again and have my vaccine, I need to visit my grandfather in Bangladesh, who just turned 92. I want to celebrate every birthday and anniversary with gusto. The Zoom calls with extended family are now mandatory and consistent. I heard Sheryl Sandberg say once, “You have two choices: You either grow old or you don’t. And if you do, it is a gift.” I try to always remember and honor that. Never miss a story"
Will productivity and growth return? An author of our new McKinsey Global Institute research discusses.,"Meet Marc Canal Noguer, a consultant and co-author of our think tank&rsquo;s latest research, who explains what it will take for a long-awaited improvement in productivity to happen.",2021-03-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/productivity%20and%20growth%20will%20it%20return%20after%20the%20pandemic/mgiproductivity-hero-small-1273354346-1536x864.jpg,McKinsey Global Institute,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/marc-canal-will-productivity-and-growth-return,"Will productivity and growth return? An author of our new McKinsey Global Institute research discusses. Capability building and reskilling are critical to increasing productivity. March 30, 2021 A retailer reduced an 18-month timeline for launching curbside pick-up to two days. A luxury hotel switched to housing essential workers with sanitized protocols in a week. A makeup company accelerated its digital transformation, gaining three years ’ of e-commerce growth in eight weeks. The stories of business innovation and rapid change across industries spurred by the pandemic are remarkable. But will this activity translate into a period of widespread productivity growth in the coming years? In the newest McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report, our analysts explore productivity and economic growth after the COVID-19 crisis across seven countries and eight sectors. Marc Canal Noguer , an engagement manager in our London office, joined McKinsey in 2014 and splits his time between MGI and several industries, including banking and consumer packaged goods, among others. Here, he shares a bit about his background and career, and provides an inside view of the findings . Let’s start by talking a bit about your background. I was born in Granollers, a small city outside Barcelona, where my family still lives. I am one of two children—I have a brother—and I was there until I was 22. My dad managed a small car dealership in town, and my mum started up her own company in her forties—an English language and travel program for kids. She is quite an entrepreneur! I went to college at Esade, in San Cugat, next to Barcelona, and earned graduate business and economics degrees in Paris and London. I have also lived in Madrid, Singapore, and Chicago. So I ’ ve lived in quite a few places. MGI has studied productivity for over 30 years. How did you personally get involved in the topic? It is the most exciting topic in the world!  It asks what are the roots of economic prosperity, right? Why do some societies get rich? And productivity is certainly the most important factor over the long run to explain prosperity, which ultimately affects all of us. Since you raised it, we’ll ask: why do some societies get rich? Ultimately, in my opinion, it has to do with innovation and technological change. Any explanation of the roots of prosperity needs to tackle why a society gets innovative, why ideas emerge and flow, and how they result in new and better technology. Can you give us a quick definition of productivity? Sure. Basically, productivity measures the amount of value created for each hour that is worked in a society. So, at the end of the day, the way to increase value for society is to either permanently add hours worked or increase the productivity or the value of each of those hours worked. Will productivity and growth return after the COVID-19 crisis? During the pandemic, a lot of companies have been forced to significantly accelerate the adoption of digital and other technologies, changing their business models and ways of working. In the process, many became more productive. Yes, and there's some initial evidence that the gains in productivity have been so far mostly in large leading firms, what we call ‘superstar’ firms, particularly in the United States. These are the bigger companies with the financial muscle and higher-skilled talent necessary to withstand the massive shocks created by the pandemic. Having innovation and investment in technology is great, but to generate an overall increase in productivity across an economy it has to be diffused, for example, among a company’s whole ecosystem of suppliers and partners. Otherwise, you can end up with only a few very innovative firms and a long tail of what you could call “laggards” or “zombies.” Beside diffusing innovation, what other factors influence overall productivity? Over the long run, skills are one of the main drivers behind productivity growth: companies need to have access to and invest in the skills of their people so they can keep up with and advance their innovations. And higher skills mean people can earn higher wages, which in turn creates greater consumption or demand for products and services—a ‘virtuous cycle.’ What are the two main takeaways from this report? In terms of GDP growth, 2020 was the worst year since World War II. But what we're pointing out here is, not withstanding that, there ’ s a silver lining: the opportunity to increase long-awaited productivity growth, which would mean higher living standards over the long run. The second takeaway is that for that to happen, we need innovation that is diffused among multiple industries, and we need there to be demand. And while it ’ s great businesses are innovating to save money and reduce costs, they also need to invest in skilling their people and innovating and uplifting their products and services. There’s also a role for governments and policymakers to gradually move their spending from supporting businesses and individuals, to investing and creating the right conditions for the private sector to invest in infrastructure, climate change mitigation, research and development, and skills for long-term returns. Which industries have been particularly innovative over this past year and will those changes stick? Two interesting ones come to mind, particularly because they have been slow in the past. One is healthcare and the rise of telehealth . In the United Kingdom, virtual consultations jumped from 10 to 85 percent during the pandemic, and part of this change will certainly stick; in the United States, 76 percent of patients expressed interest in using telehealth in the future. Telehealth replaces physical trips to healthcare facilities. It could reduce the number of emergency room visits and help manage mental health. It offers a number of benefits from widening geographic reach to improving quality of care and, not to mention, reducing costs. Construction  is another interesting example. During the pandemic, more processes and work had to be digitized and moved off site. In construction, digitization is a lot about using digital twins or building-integration modeling. It can also be used in supply chain planning, cost estimation, and timeline development. With digital twins, workers and subcontractors can then also be managed and supported with tablets that have the latest plans, or even use augmented reality tools on site. These technologies significantly reduce errors, rework, and costs, accelerating schedules and improving overall quality. There’s no going back. In terms of your own personal productivity, is there anything you've learned during the pandemic? The fact of not having to commute for an hour and a half a day, by definition, makes you more productive. That ’ s quite important. But one critical and often misunderstood thing about productivity is that it’s not just about doing things quicker. It ’ s also about learning—the skills building we talked about, or what economists would call “human capital accumulation.” And with the pandemic, pretty much everything happens over Zoom nowadays. Conferences that you could never attend before where a Nobel Prize economist is presenting a new theory, all of a sudden, are available and free on Zoom. So, I ’ ve learned a lot more. That certainly increases my productivity, and it is probably more important than being more efficient at doing something. This is my personal silver lining. related Where the jobs are: An inside look at our new Future of Work research Never miss a story"
McKinsey named a &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; in AI,"Our firm received the highest ranking possible in the The Forrester Wave&trade; AI Consultancies Q1, 2021 report.",2021-04-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20receives%20top%20ranking%20in%20the%20forrester%20wav%20ai%20report/forrester-hero-small-1294176810-1536x864.jpg,"Awards,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-receives-top-ranking-in-the-forrester-wave-ai-report,"McKinsey named a “Leader” in AI April 1, 2021 We’re excited to announce that McKinsey has been named a Leader, the highest ranking we can receive, in The Forrester Wave™ AI Consultancies Q1, 2021 report. From developing AI-infused solutions and helping organizations recruit the right data-science talent, to transforming companies end-to-end through AI, McKinsey “sets a high bar for business impact and ROI on engagements and drives to create sustainable and growing competency with clients,” wrote Forrester. Forrester evaluated 13 firms based on 26 criteria that were grouped into the categories of current offering, strategy, and market presence. McKinsey received the highest possible scores in 22 of the 26 criteria, and ranked highest across all three categories. “This recognition is a testament to the high-impact work our teams are doing. Partnering with clients to deliver significant business impact through end-to-end AI transformations is the most important aspect of our work while empowering them to run their own AI solutions and scale them,” says Alex Singla , a McKinsey senior partner who co-leads McKinsey Analytics globally with senior partner Alex Sukharevsky . In its report, Forrester states that McKinsey brings “ ‘ its secret weapons’…world-leading data-science talent, a factory model for AI development and ModelOps, and a comprehensive playbook to partner and lead the C-suite and boards into the AI age.” They also said that we deliver impact and innovate “with end-to-end, AI infused business solutions that reshape what clients do” in every sector, ranging from manufacturing and retail to mining and financial services—and most recently in sailing: for the defending champions of the America's Cup, Emirates Team New Zealand, we used deep reinforcement learning to develop an AI bot that could sail as well as professional sailors. Flying across the sea, propelled by AI “Just a few years ago, people may have been happy with the impact from scattered, siloed pilots, but we’re now helping organizations run hundreds of use-cases using a higher level of programming and pre-built, re-usable code and data libraries which enable true scaling of solutions,” explains Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and leader of QuantumBlack in Europe. “The time for new use cases from invention to production is coming down from years to weeks.” As an example, we helped a B2B company reinvent its way of working across a global network of 15,000 sales reps: refining messages, channels and cadence, and tracking relevant metrics using AI-based decision making. We helped the client establish a product engineering team within an analytics center of excellence. They built and maintained technical components, such as end-to-end data pipelines and AI models, which smaller data-science teams around the world could customize to improve local customer engagement. They were able to quickly assemble solutions to test live with sales reps frequently, with releases made every two weeks. Continually refining their management of customers improved the quality of their relationships—resulting in 10 to 15 percent top-line growth—as well as enabled them to run 101 promotional campaigns in a year, compared to being able to run only two campaigns the previous year. The technical assets we use to accelerate AI development are built in our QuantumBlack Labs. For example, Kedro , an award-winning open-source tool , standardizes data pipelines to speed up building models; Brix captures and shares re-usable code; and PerformanceAI tracks and visualizes how well data models are performing. In addition, we have devised a playbook of strategies, techniques, and best practices, based on experience leading numerous client projects, that operationalizes each phase of an AI transformation, making the entire process reliable and repeatable across organizations. This recognition is a testament to the high-impact work our teams are doing. “A core part of our value proposition is empowering our clients and building lasting capabilities,” says Alex Sukharevsky . “Our horizontal assets like Kedro, and the industry-specific assets built on top of them, solve a lot of the technical basics in an AI transformation. So we can hand them off and train clients to run and update them on their own.” This handoff means ensuring that the right people and processes are in place. “Assembling the right mix of talent in client tech teams and establishing an engineering culture of continuous learning is a priority, followed by the technologies, tools, and processes to support them,” explains Nayur Khan , an associate partner. One hallmark of an engineering culture is the organizing of communities of practice so participants can undertake research, share learning, and grow skills. “In most organizations, the tech talent is scattered throughout so the first step is to unite them,” explains Nayur. Other organizational elements include a strong on-boarding program, defined career paths, opportunities to “toggle” between cutting-edge research and development, and on-the-ground client work. To build technical skills and community, we help clients organize hackathons, create skills academies , and, when needed, can establish a free-standing AI/analytics unit. “The bare minimum to be in this space is no longer just to understand and offer analytics. You have to be at the cutting edge,” says Nicolaus Henke, a senior partner of McKinsey Analytics. “We are constantly scanning the landscape to identify technologies with significant business potential and continually refreshing our own expertise on machine learning, quantum computing and other emerging capabilities.” related McKinsey named a “Leader” in Digital Transformation Never miss a story"
How four simple words helped thousands find jobs: The story behind Career Exchange,"One year ago, a collaboration between McKinsey and Eightfold.ai was launched to help thousands who had lost their jobs overnight in the pandemic. This is the story of the whirlwind three weeks it took the team to create the platform.",2021-04-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20story%20behind%20career%20exchange/eight-fold-hero-small-1247965353-1536x864.jpg,"COVID-19,Retail,Organization,United States",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-story-behind-career-exchange,"How four simple words helped thousands find jobs: The story behind Career Exchange April 7, 2021 As the pandemic took hold last March, many retailers, some of whom were already struggling, were forced to lay off large numbers of people as stores and entire divisions closed. Meanwhile, businesses such as groceries and delivery services began hiring at an unprecedented scale and pace to respond to a massive spike in consumer demand. At the time, partners in McKinsey’s Retail Practice were holding back-to-back calls, trying to connect the companies downsizing with those that were hiring. “The conversations always left us with the same four words,” says partner Praveen Adhi. “How can we help?” This desire led to a whirlwind three weeks, in which colleagues from our Retail and Organization Practices, partnering with Eightfold.ai, created the Career Exchange , an AI-powered online employment marketplace that pairs workers with jobs that match their skillsets. The US-based platform can host thousands of users at once, delivering an average of eight to nine job leads per person. Since launching last April, the Career Exchange has onboarded more than 120 companies and will soon include more than two million jobs from the National Labor Exchange. From the outbreak’s earliest days, explains Praveen , the need for something like the Career Exchange was obvious. “It became clear very quickly that informal networking was not going to work,” he says. “We needed a more systemic way to help our clients cope with what was becoming the fastest, largest shift in labor since World War II."" He and McKinsey partner Andrew Davis did an informal assessment of talent platforms and job boards, but found they had been created for ‘normal’ environments; none had the capacity to accommodate the thousands of people changing jobs at once because of the pandemic. They turned to the Organization Practice and found Carla Arellano, a partner who helps clients use analytics to hire and manage their talent.  “I remember thinking at the time: wouldn’t it be amazing if there was a way to connect those organizations who were letting go of people with those who were hiring,” she says. “And better yet, if we can accelerate the hiring process by showing applicants opportunities by sorting jobs by skill sets, not just titles."" Unsurprisingly, McKinsey was not the only organization wondering how it could help tackle this emerging issue. Carla discussed the challenge with Eightfold.ai , a talent partner our firm had been working with, using their extensive stores of data to develop expertise in job matching and career pathing. “Eightfold was eager to join forces,” Andrew says. “They had the same goals that we did: to help people.” Over the next week, the team built a strawman-version of the platform and created personas, or examples of users, based on their conversations with retail clients. The site would have to be easy to use and allow job seekers to submit basic information including their location, whether they had car access, their appetite for working in an office during the pandemic, and their most recent job. From there, Eightfold’s AI could infer their skills and match them to jobs. “We imagined the user to be someone who had just been laid off, filling out the application on his or her phone,” says Emily Field , who helped lead the project. “Often, they wouldn’t have a resume or LinkedIn profile. We looked at all of the friction points in the hiring process and sought to streamline them.” On a Friday evening, McKinsey and Eightfold came together to discuss the strawman, and Eightfold built the functionality over the weekend. “Late Sunday night, some 30 people showed up for the call to see what the site might look like,” said Andrew. “We envisioned a simple matching platform. But the Eightfold algorithm was much more sophisticated; it could analyze millions of jobs across data sets.” By looking at the job seeker’s inputs, the platform could deduce the skills a person was likely to have from their work experiences and match them with jobs based on those skills—rather than their former roles. This widened the scope of job possibilities for each. For example, an airline luggage handler might be matched with openings in warehouse logistics; an experienced barista could be connected with customer rep jobs; a construction scheduler might be slotted for a clinical coordinator position. The site also had to address the needs of hiring companies. “An amazing client stepped up to help us with testing the site,” Praveen recalls. “They helped us figure out what data work was required to seamlessly upload hundreds of jobs, how effective the user experience was, and what was the best way to integrate the site with a company's own HR systems.” Launching a public-facing site in three weeks was exhilarating. On April 6, a year ago today and three weeks after the initial client conversations, the site launched, and the team orchestrated major outreach to companies: both those laying off employees and those looking to expand. “It took some time, and the work was difficult, but we began to gain more traction,” says Emily. “In April, a delivery service joined the exchange, posting thousands of openings. Then, as layoffs spread, other industries joined, such as airlines and hotels. In May, college grads began to enroll, and the job profiles evolved: more digital and IT jobs came on as companies turned their attention to online channels.” In addition to helping more than 10,000 job searchers since launching, the platform has also expanded to include reskilling, with more than 1000 free courses through Udemy, Coursera, and edX. In three short weeks, some 15+ colleagues across Practices, disciplines, tenures and geographies dropped everything in the moment to help problem-solve issues and offer expertise to make the platform work. “Launching a public-facing site in three weeks was exhilarating,” says Carla. “It was an extraordinary effort in an extraordinary time.” And it all began with four simple words: how can we help? Career Exchange is a COVID-19 response initiative offered at no cost to companies hiring, furloughing, or laying off individuals. It is a digital talent marketplace that aims to address the mismatch of labor supply and demand, helping organizations and individuals. McKinsey & Company supports the platform as part of our commitment to safeguarding livelihoods.

Our latest commitment to protect the planet: Reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030,"Building on prior efforts, we have set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and offset our remaining carbon footprint.",2021-04-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/reaching%20net%20zero%20climate%20impact%20by%202030/sustainability-hero-small-1258177412-1536x864.jpg,"Sustainability,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/reaching-net-zero-climate-impact-by-2030,"Our latest commitment to protect the planet: Reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030 April 15, 2021 In honor of Earth Day next week, we are excited to announce that we will achieve net-zero climate impact as a firm by 2030 and that we have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign , a coalition of corporate leaders taking ambitious climate action. These moves build on the commitments we made in 2018 to reduce emissions, transition to 100 percent renewable electricity, and become carbon neutral by fully offsetting our emissions every year. “Our planet is at a tipping point, and to avoid the most dangerous and irreversible effects of climate change, we must dramatically reduce emissions over the next ten years—starting now,” says Jop Weterings , our director of environmental sustainability. “Despite the impact of the global pandemic, carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere have continued to rise, and emissions may surge as the economy recovers. At the same time, we’re encouraged by a broader trend where many organizations are investing in longer-term resilience measures that advance environmental sustainability. We are committed to doing our part.” Pledging to achieve net-zero climate impact means that we are making changes to the way we operate to ensure, within the next decade, the climate-change impact of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions we produce as an organization will be effectively zero. Why investing in nature is key to climate mitigation To reach that goal, we have first set science-based targets (validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative ) to reduce our GHG emissions by 2025 in line with a 1.5-degree pathway, the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement. From a 2019 baseline, we will reduce by 25 percent our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions—those produced by sources we own or control and those from purchased energy. We will also reduce by 30 percent per employee our Scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel by building on lessons learned during the global pandemic and embracing alternative working models as we transition into the next normal. For our remaining footprint, we will remove carbon from the atmosphere through nature-based solutions that help address both the climate and nature crises , while generating significant additional environmental, social, and economic benefits. We will increasingly focus on projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as reforestation projects, to ensure our remaining footprint is neutralized by 2030, and we will also continue to invest in projects that protect forests. In fact, achieving a 1.5-degree pathway would require nearly halting deforestation by the end of this decade (which would, in addition, also help tackle the rapid loss of biodiversity and ecosystems) . During our transition to net zero, we will continue to offset all our emissions by investing in carbon-reduction projects certified to international standards. The urgency to act has never been clearer, the responsibility to do so has never been greater. Managing our own footprint is only one part of our broader approach to sustainability. We work with our clients to help them transform the sustainability of their operations and build strategies, markets, and partnerships to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon and sustainable-growth economy. We also use our knowledge and capabilities to create and support long-term solutions to environmental challenges. From the greenhouse gas abatement curves we first introduced more than a decade ago, to our more recent research on climate risk and socioeconomic impacts , McKinsey provides a fact base to help decision makers understand the challenges brought on by climate change and how they can be mitigated. We put our research into action through our client work and pro bono support of environmental not-for-profits. “While we have much to be proud of with respect to our progress and new commitments, we know that we can do more and we are well-positioned to help our clients do more, too,” says Jop. “Recent climate events serve as a reminder. The urgency to act has never been clearer, the responsibility to do so has never been greater.” To learn more about our efforts to protect the planet, please visit our Environmental Sustainability page. related On an Earth Day marked by pandemic, why addressing climate risk is as important as ever Protecting the ocean: Young innovators share big ideas Never miss a story"

April 15, 2021 Our newest McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report on consumer demand after COVID-19 has something for everyone. It offers big-picture economic analysis across five countries, along with deep dives into the details of daily life: what we eat for dinner, how we exercise, what we do for fun. Sydney Bub, Henry Pollock, and Maciej Latocha were part of the MGI research team that produced the report. They helped to identify six case studies in areas that reflect a broad swath of daily consumer life and three-quarters of consumer spending:  e-grocery, virtual healthcare, home nesting (investing in products and services that improve the experience of being at home), leisure air travel, entertainment, and education. The team analyzed nine consumer segments, based on age and income, in China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. And they devised a ‘stickiness’ metric, earmarking the economic, emotional, and social factors that help make a behavior last as times change. The report also features many of the ingenious ways organizations reached out to their customers during the pandemic. The top line?  E-grocery, virtual healthcare, and home nesting are here to stay and likely to grow; leisure travel and dining, which have been dramatically curtailed, will resume with some changes; and kids will definitely go back to the classroom when it’s safe . To learn more, we caught up with Sydney, Henry and Maciej. They gave us a behind-the-scenes look at the findings and reflected on the ways the pandemic has changed their own lives. Sydney Bub, senior business analyst The case studies I covered were virtual healthcare, remote education, and entertainment.  When I reflect on this past year, my favorite innovation has been the increased use of outdoor space by gyms, cultural institutions, and restaurants. I personally love to work out and many of my favorite studios have begun offering classes with disco headsets for outdoors, from bootcamps on lawns to spinning on patios, that don’t disturb neighbors. This will definitely continue post-pandemic as the classes have been so popular. Similarly, a number of museums and galleries are offering outdoor and drive-through exhibits.  My parents live in California and went to the Field of Lights , a solar-powered exhibit recreating a field of poppies, the state flower of California. It covered acres—there were glowing poppies everywhere, and it was designed to be COVID-19-safe and sustainable. There are other examples: in Toronto, Van ‘Gogh by car’, in Sao Paulo, a drive-through exhibit set up with in-car audio. Related MGI reports Museums are also using digital in creative ways. Since they couldn't host student tours, a museum in the UK began sending museum in a box to schools, with carefully chosen objects on loan. Students can engage with materials while doing an online tour.  Last June, when The Brooklyn Museum knew they wouldn't open their doors for months, they collaborated with Netflix on a stunning digital exhibit of costumes from “ The Crown ” and “ The Queen's Gambit. ” The costumes could actually be more easily seen in the well-lit, beautifully designed virtual rooms; normally costume exhibitions are held in dark rooms to preserve the clothes. These alternative settings offer benefits such as highlighting difficult-to-show pieces, offering more information, and reaching new audiences, that I think make them likely to “stick” post-COVID-19. Henry Pollock, senior business analyst I focused on leisure travel, e-grocery, and home nesting.  When I think back on consumer life this past year, it's nothing short of amazing to have gotten so many older people online. This is a complete cohort, some of whom had been on the sidelines of the digital world, that is now very adept at online shopping, exercise classes, and video calls. One reason is because of the expansion and accessibility of online instructional material—tutorials on social media, videos on YouTube, and other sites. This, combined with people having the time and opportunity at home to learn, has brought the majority of an entire generation’s lives online in less than a year. They have developed skills that will help them feel more connected and functional in our post-COVID-19 world, where our research shows that services such as telehealth and e-grocery will remain strong. Digitization and remote working also allowed people to move away from their office locations, often in urban areas, and live in places they preferred. I moved to a small mountain town in Idaho—2,500 people—for a more active outdoors life this past summer and know a number of “digital nomads” who made similar moves to Texas, Nevada, and North Carolina. On a more casual note, a small but fun innovation has been the use of QR codes in place of menus in restaurants. I remember thinking: “Wow, I can ’ t believe we haven ’ t done this before.”   It integrates seamlessly with our phone, a medium that for better or worse, is an extension of our selves. You can get far more information, from photos to listings of ingredients and nutritional data, and then order and pay. It provides a level of experience that's impossible to replicate with a simple paper menu or chalk board on a wall. Maciej Latocha, junior associate I did the overall economic analysis for the report. The case study that felt most personal to me was the home nesting. This trend is very interesting to me. Over the last ten to 20 years, as economies were doing well, people were spending more time out of the house on entertainment. As we know, that changed instantly last March when everyone, everywhere was suddenly forced to stay home.
We saw a significant investment in furnishings, technology upgrades for work, learning and entertainment, gym equipment, and outdoor spaces. It was one of the bright spots in consumer buying. Because of this material commitment and the increased availability of better entertainment and streaming services, we think there will be a strong incentive for people to spend more time at home post-COVID-19. I saw this in my own life. With restaurants and bars closed, I ’ ve learned how to cook, and ordered takeaway more than I did prior to the outbreak.  Some restaurants have been very creative in devising entire dining experiences-in-a-box, with food, table décor, cocktails or wines, and even music playlists. That is a change I think is likely to stay. related Will productivity and growth return? An author of our new McKinsey Global Institute research discusses.

April 19, 2021 Savvy and discerning consumers are driving the bar for good design higher and higher, which means that only the very best product designs stand out from the crowd. We are delighted to announce that six products created by McKinsey Design clients have won 2021 Red Dot Awards for Product Design . Launched in 1955, the Red Dot Award for Product Design honors the best products created every year across a wide range of categories, from robot technology to vehicles to household aids.  Each submission is reviewed by a jury of 50 international design experts and assessed for criteria including functionality, quality, and durability. Here is a look at our clients’ winning products, three of which have also received 2021 iF Awards for Product Design. 3M Speedglas Welding Helmet G5-02 The 3M Speedglas Welding Helmet G5-02 holds the world’s first curved auto-darkening filter. Designed for highly precise tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, the curved filter darkens automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc. Its design allows it to follow the curved shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This helmet, which has been awarded a Best of the Best distinction by the Red Dot judges, was designed as part of a cohesive range for 3M, where each helmet targets the needs of a specific type of user. Axkid ONE car seat Axkid is a child car seat manufacturer with a “passion for children’s right to safety.” Inspired by the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation that children should remain in a rear-facing car seat for as long as possible, they set out to create a new kind of car seat, one that would be rear-facing, comfortable, and adjustable for children up to seven years of age. With help from McKinsey Design, Axkid realized that vision in their new ONE car seat . Baby Björn Harmony baby carrier Baby Björn sought to create a single baby carrier that would be ergonomically designed for both parents and their children, from infants to toddlers. With help from McKinsey Design, they created the Baby Carrier Harmony, a carrier that is adjustable to different heights, which allows babies aged zero to three years to sit comfortably. The product design includes mesh fabric, wide and padded shoulder straps, and a pressure-relieving waist belt. Blueair HealthProtect™/Blueair Protect air purifier The Blueair HealthProtect™/Blueair Protect is the company’s flagship range of air purifiers, which they have created in an effort to realize their stated vision of exemplifying Blueair’s air purification expertise and revolutionizing the market. McKinsey Design worked with Blueair to understand what the modern premium consumer wanted in an air purifier and then translated that vision into design. The HealthProtect purifier has also been awarded a 2021 iF Award for Product Design . Blueair DustMagnet air purifier For their DustMagnet line of air purifiers, Blueair sought to create an air purifier that would become an essential element in homes by combining the utility of a top-performing dust filter with the design Scandinavian furniture. Working with McKinsey Design, they developed the DustMagnet line, which is intended to blend into living spaces as a side or end table while also capturing 99 percent of airborne dust before it settles on the floor. Like the HealthProtect purifier, the DustMagnet has also won a 2021 iF Award for Product Design . Tobii Pro Glasses 3 Eye tracking is the practice of observing what people look at, and for how long, in order to learn more about the way they make decisions or behave in an environment. McKinsey Design contributed to the creation of the Tobii Pro Glasses 3 , a wearable eye-tracking device that can be used in research scenarios to improve business productivity, enhance shopping experiences, design safer products, and more. The product’s slim design allows users to move through space in a natural, unburdened way, helping researchers gather unbiased insights more easily. In addition to its Red Dot recognition, the Tobii Pro Glasses 3 has also received a 2021 iF Award for Product Design . related Four Red Dot awards for McKinsey Design Never miss a story"
Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero,"To help every industry get to &ldquo;net zero&rdquo; by 2050, McKinsey Sustainability will serve clients on sustainable corporate strategy, green business building, sustainable investing, and more.",2021-04-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/announcing%20the%20launch%20of%20mckinsey%20sustainability/sustainability-hero-small-1170098138-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/announcing-the-launch-of-mckinsey-sustainability,"Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero April 20, 2021 Today, we are announcing the launch of McKinsey Sustainability , our new client-service platform with the goal of helping all industry sectors transform to get to net zero by 2050 and to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030. McKinsey Sustainability seeks to be the preeminent impact partner and advisor for our clients, from the board room to the engine room, on sustainability, climate, energy transition, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG). We are committed to investing behind this goal over the next four years—through our client service, knowledge and capability building, acquisitions and alliances as well as pro-bono investments. This launch builds on our nearly 100-year history and our mission to help our clients make distinctive, lasting, and substantial improvements in their performance in several ways: by developing distinctive insights; convening leaders across the private, public, and social sector; and acting as a responsible citizen of the world. We will deploy the innovative capabilities, tools, and solutions we have created and embedded in our work across industries and functions that are making a difference already. “Our aim is to be the largest private sector catalyst for decarbonization,” says our global managing partner Kevin Sneader. “The transition to a net-zero economy will increase the basis of innovation and competition. Those who act now will be advantaged, and we will help our clients ensure they are among these sustainability leaders.” McKinsey Sustainability will invest in the creation of climate and energy transition thought leadership, building on our ground-breaking work on carbon cost curves, which began with our first report on greenhouse gas abatement in 2007 and more recently continued with our January 2020 McKinsey Global Institute report “ Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impact .” Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts We are assembling the best talent in the world—including a broad set of McKinsey leaders from every industry and functional practice—to move at speed and at scale. More than 1,000 of our colleagues have already joined the new platform, and we aspire to be the top destination for the best sustainability and climate talent everywhere. Our plans embrace the four key levers needed to decarbonize. We will help our clients drive a ‘brown to green’ transition of the global economy’s installed base; build tomorrow’s new green businesses and innovations; retire and repurpose the highest carbon intensity assets; and scale nature-based solutions by scaling voluntary and compliance carbon markets. As a firm, we are aligned around a set of comprehensive capabilities and solutions that will be embedded in all our industries and functions as we help our clients get to net zero: creating strategies that help respond to areas where they are over exposed to climate risk and under exposed to the opportunity of ‘going green,’ amid rising systemic risk; growing new sustainable businesses; catalyzing decarbonization strategies; realigning and reallocating capital across provider portfolios; and forming and deploying capital into new growth for sustainable businesses. We are proud of the impact our clients’ have already achieved, which includes building a new green steel factory from scratch in Northern Europe, scaling up hydrogen capabilities to get to net zero, and stress testing portfolios to assess asset exposure to the physical and transition risks posed by climate change. Our March acquisition of Vivid Economics is a significant milestone in our efforts. A leading player in climate and sustainability economics, Vivid brings an established track record of helping clients accelerate their paths to net zero. This is one of the largest acquisitions we have made as part of our goal to be the leading management consultancy in climate-related issues in the financial sector. McKinsey acquires Vivid Economics and Planetrics to help clients navigate climate change We will continue our work as a knowledge partner and convener across a vibrant ecosystem of industry associations and institutions. These partnerships include the World Economic Forum , working across a number of sectors, including agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and mobility, including a recent collaboration for the report “ Nature and Net Zero ”; the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets , sponsored by the Institute of International Finance; the COP 26 Private Finance Hub’s Portfolio Alignment Team, which is identifying best practices to measure the alignment of financial portfolios with climate goals, in collaboration with the Taskforce on Financial Related Climate Disclosures; and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development to support the Value Chain Carbon Transparency Pathfinder , a new initiative dedicated to enabling widespread exchange of primary carbon emissions data. To enable these capabilities and solutions, we are also establishing the McKinsey Academy for Sustainability to train boards, CXOs, and colleagues on climate change along with several Technology Centers of Excellence that will lead cutting-edge innovation on batteries, hydrogen, carbon capture, nature-based solutions, water, plastics, and more. These moves are reflected in our own commitments as a firm and our 33,000 colleagues to reach net zero climate impact by 2030 .  During McKinsey’s transition to net zero, we will continue to compensate all our emissions, including those from travel, by investing in carbon-reduction projects certified to international standards. And we are committed to measuring and quantifying the difference we are making as we help industries and society more generally on the path to decarbonization and to net zero by 2050 or earlier. When it comes to fighting climate change the time to engage is now. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation. Our research shows that the physical risk from climate change will continue to increase until the world achieves net zero emissions. To stay below 1.5C, emissions must be cut by half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050, in keeping with the Paris Agreement. The real economy today is carbon intensive and needs to be transitioned rapidly. “When it comes to fighting climate change the time to engage is now,” says Kevin. “We are determined to do our part and help others achieve the change that is needed and needed urgently.” Never miss a story"
Making It Work: An associate on the first days of the outbreak&mdash;and what she&rsquo;s learned 15 months later,"We&rsquo;re talking to several McKinsey women about how they&rsquo;ve made it work over the last year&mdash;the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the pandemic has shaped their outlook on life and work.",2021-04-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Our People,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/making-it-work-an-associate-on-the-first-days-of-the-outbreak-and-what-shes-learned-15-months-later,"Making It Work: An associate on the first days of the outbreak—and what she’s learned 15 months later April 22, 2021 The pandemic has disproportionately affected women. In our Women in the Workplace research last year, 1 in 4 of them said they were considering taking a step back in their careers or leaving the workforce entirely. More than a year after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, we’re talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work over the last year—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the pandemic has shaped their outlook on life and work. Here, Lucille Chen, an associate based in Shanghai, talks about missing family, navigating quarantine across different locations, and learning to appreciate the small joys of life. On the first days of the virus outbreak: I was on a client study and still remember learning about the pandemic outbreak in real time. It seemed serious, but I had already made plans to go back to Taiwan to visit my parents for Chinese New Year. Because of the outbreak, we had an additional week off of work after the New Year break, and I went to Japan during it, before returning to Taiwan. The virus spread was growing, but at that time, I didn’t feel like the outbreak would affect me personally. Of course, looking back, that sounds so silly. On navigating the pivot to remote work: After Chinese New Year, life was still relatively normal in Taiwan—large events and gatherings were canceled, but people were able to go out with a mask on. Because we were working remotely anyway, I ended up staying in Taiwan until last June, when I finally went back to Shanghai. During that time, I did my first remote study, which was a huge departure from the way we typically work with clients. But because everyone—the team, our client—was aware of the situation, we all rallied to make it work. And learned a lot along the way, like how to problem solve and communicate remotely. On not being able to visit her parents because of travel restrictions and quarantine guidelines: I haven’t been able to visit my parents in almost a year, and it’s been quite tough. Even when travel has been allowed, the two-week mandatory quarantine in both locations means I need to take a month off for a trip. Before the pandemic, I would go back once a month, so it has been a big change. Luckily, we’re able to use social apps to video chat, but at the end of every call they ask, “When are you coming back to visit?” And I always say: “I don’t know.” On the unexpected challenges and lessons from the pandemic—and how it’s changed her outlook on life: Like many people, I could have never predicted that the impact of the virus outbreak would be so huge—and global. I was pretty lucky in that Taiwan was mostly open when I was there for the first part of the pandemic, and Shanghai was relatively back to normal when I got back. But even the two-week quarantines I went through were tough. It’s lonely, and you start to feel a little depressed. I have lots of friends who’ve spent the last year in lockdown, and they have certainly felt depressed at times, too. During lockdown, I reflected on what really matters in life and decided to freeze my eggs in Taiwan last year. I’m single and realized it was something I needed to do before it was too late. I’ve had lots of friends who had difficulty getting pregnant when they finally wanted to start a family. These days I treasure time more than ever—even just the chance to have dinner with friends, it’s so special to me now. You never know when that can be taken away again. Never miss a story"
How green waste management led to COVID-19 relief in Buenos Aires,The story of an effort to feed waste workers that became an initiative to adapt to pandemic conditions and help prevent the spread of the virus.,2021-04-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/rethinking%20recycling%20green%20and%20inclusive%20waste%20management%20in%20buenos%20aires/rethinkingrecycling-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Sustainability",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/rethinking-recycling-green-and-inclusive-waste-management-in-buenos-aires,"How green waste management led to COVID-19 relief in Buenos Aires In an informal settlement called Barrio 31 in Argentina, waste workers and their neighbors came together to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. (Photo courtesy of Rethinking Recycling.) April 30, 2021 Well before the COVID-19 pandemic, the world was confronting an enormous waste problem. Without effective approaches to managing the materials and food we discard, our waste production inevitably becomes a set of health, human development, and environmental challenges . By 2050, global waste volumes are predicted to more than double in low- to middle-income countries. During the pandemic, single-use products and panic buying, accompanied by limited waste collection or recycling efforts, made the waste management challenge even more daunting. Rethinking Recycling , a non-profit initiative supported by McKinsey, aims to create a globally scalable model to manage waste and help communities rapidly increase the amount of material recycled into productive use. It achieves this by developing and scaling self-sustaining, community-owned recycling programs and by working with corporate players to help absorb the available supply. The initiative’s approach works by engaging all stakeholders in the waste management cycle, from local waste pickers and communities to local and national government agencies and global corporations, to develop solutions that are scalable, inclusive, and effective. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, Rethinking Recycling faced multiple challenges. In Argentina where the team works in an informal settlement called Barrio 31, the newly-established recycling center was shut down due to COVID-19 restriction. The shutdown deprived essential waste workers, already a highly marginalized social group, of their livelihoods. In addition, like informal settlements all over the world, Barrio 31 was hit extremely hard by the pandemic, both in terms of health and economic impacts. Social distancing and quarantining were almost impossible in the close conditions of many households in the community, driving infection rates up dramatically, while many residents were cut off from much-needed wages. “At first, we just wanted to figure out a way to help the workers in our programs and the communities they serve,” said Shannon Bouton , President and CEO of McKinsey.org. “With the loss of their livelihoods, most people in such settlements did not have the space or the means to stockpile food supplies.” To address the initial need, Rethinking Recycling partnered with organizations distributing food packages to poor communities in Buenos Aires to ensure they reached the families of Barrio 31. However, what began as an effort to feed waste workers and their neighbors, grew into a much bigger effort to both adapt to pandemic conditions and help prevent the spread of the virus. Assunçᾶo Chaves — an operations specialist from McKinsey’s Lisbon office and a fellow on the Rethinking Recycling program — served as a biomedical and cold chain (vaccines) expert for Doctors Without Borders in her pre-McKinsey career. She saw the potential to go beyond feeding families and do even more to help with the devastating impacts of the pandemic. She had seen how the vast networks established by Rethinking Recycling could be leveraged for other purposes—such as rapid testing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Rethinking Recycling, with Chaves’ support, brought in Doctors Without Borders to expand the reach of their pandemic prevention efforts. The partnership was able to train volunteers to conduct the screenings. The success of the pilot program in Barrio 31 prompted the city government to expand the program to other informal settlements in Buenos Aires, and as a result, the volume of screenings in these neighborhoods reached over 10,000 residents per day. While Rethinking Recycling was able to pivot to aiding people and communities on COVID-19 prevention, at the same time, the initiative also worked on the challenge of continuing its main charge: sustainable waste management. During the pandemic, the Rethinking Recycling team created safety protocols and distributed personal protective equipment for waste workers to stay safe so they could continue to provide vitally needed waste collection services to the community. “At Rethinking Recycling, we are invested in the well-being of the communities we work with. We understand that a waste management system is as good as the social and economic constructs it operates in,” said Bouton. “We are happy that by leveraging our networks and ingenuity, we were able to create an army of informal health operators, who our communities could rely on, in a time of grave need.” For more information on Rethinking Recycling, please visit our social responsibility page . related How McKinsey.org is helping to rethink recycling around the world Never miss a story"

Vaccines save millions of lives every year and are widely recognized as one of the world’s most successful health interventions. They’re also an area in which we have helped our clients in the global fight against infectious diseases for more than half a century. Foundations, governments, international organizations, and pharmaceutical companies have made great progress over that period in improving health outcomes for those greatest in need. Between 2000 and today, for instance, the number of children’s lives lost annually to vaccine preventable diseases has fallen from 4 to 5 million per year to 1.5 million today, with over 20 million cumulative lives saved. “The impact that immunizations have had on the world over the last 20 years is amazing” says senior partner Adam Sabow, who co-leads our work in vaccines. “We have seen that on full display during COVID-19.  At the same time, this pandemic has also highlighted the challenges that still remain.  We are proud to be part of the immunization ecosystem, playing a small role in supporting our clients around COVID-19 and immunization more broadly.” This latest fight against infectious disease has ushered in an accelerated pace of development, with vaccines arriving four times faster than prior vaccines. We have also seen an unprecedented scale of rollout globally, although it has been uneven. As the pandemic continues to evolve, some countries are now on the path to recovery and others are continuing to face challenges. A broad range of institutions are collaborating in this historic effort to develop, distribute, and provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. To help, we have drawn upon decades of experience in global public health, led by more than 300 colleagues who bring deep expertise in public health, in-country delivery and rollout, immunology, clinical development, operations, and supply chains. “In the early days, we had a small group of folks passionate about global health doing this work,” says senior partner Michael Conway, who also co-leads our work in vaccines. “Today, we attract hundreds of nurses, doctors, immunologists, and public-health specialists, all of whom join the firm to have an outsized impact on lives around the world.” Meet some of our vaccines experts helping clients fight COVID-19 The massive global effort over the last year has ignited a wave of innovation, and looking ahead, we see the potential for a renaissance in immunization in several areas. Realizing this vision will require leadership across the private and public sector and continued collaboration among scientists, governments, businesses, and other stakeholders. In the context of COVID-19, we are just at the beginning of the road to recovery, and real challenges continue to impact the lives and livelihoods of people around the world. As the pandemic evolves, we asked some of our experts to share their perspectives on their experiences, the challenges that lie ahead, and the pandemic that is shaping us. related Doctors at McKinsey mobilize in fight against coronavirus On his first deployment, confronting a pandemic Never miss a story"
McKinsey to help Singapore build new businesses in corporate venture program,"Leap by McKinsey has been appointed to be one of four business-building platforms in a new initiative to promote entrepreneurship in Singapore. Here's a look at our unique approach to business building.

It’s so appealing and easy-to-use, the organization gains 26 million clients in two years. An apartment complex, empty for months, is now fully occupied, attracting tenants with a new suite of personalized services, ranging from grocery delivery to housekeeping. These are just two examples of the 380 new businesses that our Leap by McKinsey team has helped develop, from a spark of an idea through to full-fledged business, over the past five years. Now our business building unit has just been appointed as one of four venture studios for the Economic Development Board of Singapore , with whom we have long-standing partnerships, in their newest initiative, the Corporate Venture Launchpad. This year-long program will provide up to $10 million in grants to help established companies create Singapore-based ventures that can serve regional and global markets. “We are incredibly excited,” says Badrinath Ramanathan , managing partner of our Singapore office. “At a round table l ast October, 11 out of 13 CEOs of Singapore-listed companies shared that venture-building is among their top priorities. We believe the next wave in creating value will come from innovation by incumbent companies, even more so than start-ups.” For the Corporate Venture Launchpad—which also includes FutureLabs, a studio founded by McKinsey alum Mario Aquino—we will create a six-week Venture Program with eight team members who run sprints, from validating concepts through developing a viable business plan. Based on Leap’s work to date, our methodology delivers a 5.1x average ROI compared to venture capital’s average of 2.9x, and a 67 percent likelihood of the business scaling compared to the startup average of 2 percent. The Leap team is uniquely positioned to marshal the full resources of our firm: 700 business builders and 5000 experts across multiple disciplines. “We bring the best of our strategy expertise with deep digital skills across analytics, design, cloud, and software engineering,” says Andrew Roth , an expert associate partner and seasoned entrepreneur. “This allows us to orchestrate what makes a business viable, technically feasible, and desirable in the marketplace, thereby putting the odds in favor of our client.” Leap colleagues have helped launch new businesses in more than 60 countries, delivering a range of products and services to users with a variety of needs and desires. The work has taught them what works and what doesn’t when it comes to launching and scaling new businesses. “For example, to inspire conviction in the client leadership team, we offer ‘ go and see ’ visits with peer founders, interactive workshops, and virtual experiences with artifacts in which executives can start to see opportunity,” explains Yishan Lam , a design director. This is a wonderful opportunity to create Singapore’s next generation of business leaders. To test out different product and service concepts quickly, our analysts can undertake ethnographic and social media testing and tap into industry and geographic research so that we are building a product grounded in customer insight.  For the technical requirements of a new offering, one of our architects then reviews the client's current tech environment and configures one that illustrates how the new product or service might work. “From day one, we work closely with the client team to create a strong culture, focused on moving forward towards our goal,” adds Yishan. “This includes introducing or developing the capabilities the team needs, such as agile experts and more.” That dynamic, according to Badrinath, is increasingly indicative of the way our firm works today, as we build products, services, and businesses side by side with our clients. “Consumers and companies are at a turning point, and they are ready for this kind of entrepreneurship,” he says. “This is a wonderful opportunity to create Singapore’s next generation of business leaders.” related What does it take to help a new business take off?

Two women who have shaped who she is today, at work and in life, are her mother Irma and daughter Kate. Recently the three sat down for a conversation that explored their perspectives on women in leadership, finding purpose and inspiration, and prioritizing well-being in a challenging year. Here, Liz shares her reflections from the conversation. Career and leadership perspectives As the child of two working parents, I never questioned whether or not I would work. From an early age, I wanted to follow in my father’s footsteps and work in business. But it wasn’t until I actually joined the workforce that I understood the challenges that came with it—whether that was being one of the few (or only) women in certain meetings, balancing parenthood with a career, or navigating evolving expectations of what it means to be a woman in leadership. Through the years, the people who have grounded me and inspired me most have been friends, colleagues, and family members, whom I can relate to and admire. In light of this, and in honor of Mother’s Day here in the U.S., I sat down with two women who have been constant advisors in my life and influences on my career: my mom Irma and daughter Kate. My mom completed her graduate degree in the mid-1960s while raising two young children and then went on to work as a psychologist, researching various topics including mothers’ work-life balance. She’s the first to point out that several important factors enabled her to work—an important one being that she had support at home, as well as a supportive partner and good friends who leaned in when she couldn’t get out of the house easily. Working in academia also suited her because it offered her flexibility to design her own class schedule and to work remotely outside of the academic year. But the norms have changed significantly since I was a child. My daughter, for instance, notes the working women who surround her have made her feel confident that it is possible to be a strong working professional and impactful leader, regardless of what her future home life may entail. At 17, she’s already finding unique ways to speak up and lead, whether that’s serving as the president of her school’s mental health club, or bringing all of us at home together through a fun activity, or, more recently, calling a family meeting that resulted in our latest addition, our puppy Sydney Segel. On balancing work and life In our family, the challenge of balancing work, school, and personal lives is not new. But during the pandemic, for those of us who have been working from home and literally “sleeping at the office,” this balancing act has become even harder. It’s a topic my mom has researched with her graduate students and experienced firsthand. In our conversation, she reminded me that compartmentalizing—and not thinking about work when you’re with family—can be a helpful strategy. Naturally, there will be overlap in our efforts to compartmentalize, so I have had to figure out my non-negotiables. According to my daughter, those include family dinner, which is why we have a strict no-calls-during-dinner rule. It works well for us. We have some family friends who tell us that doing the same is challenging, but they’ve found ways to incorporate similar rules into family walks or breakfast instead. What’s important is to determine your non-negotiables, establish realistic boundaries, and stick with them. My mom has always reminded me: “You are a parent 24/7. There is enough time for you to do the things you love and to be there for your children. They will be happy if you are happy and fulfilled.” For me, pursuing my career has complemented the joy that comes with being a parent. At the same time, there were times I had trouble keeping all the balls in the air, and that sometimes put Kate in the position of having to help me with the juggling act. She takes pride in her independence and attributes it, in part, to certain formative moments growing up she had to take ownership of a situation. She gained confidence along the way, and I learned to show myself some grace. Finding ways to make it work is a unique process for all of us, but for me, it’s been so comforting to know that I can count on the encouragement, and occasional commiseration, of my many friends and family members who are also working parents. Finding inspiration and reconnecting to purpose It’s natural to feel exhausted, especially these days when boundaries between our professional and personal lives have blurred and support structures we may have counted on are no longer available. I think of my colleagues across the firm who are parenting young children, who might be feeling overwhelmed with the need to keep it together. I think about the “onlys”—the only woman or the only woman of color—in organizations, C-suites, and board rooms, who may feel pressured to work harder, with longer hours, to prove themselves. And I think about my 87-year-old mother, who was physically isolated during the pandemic. I’m inspired by her perseverance to make a difference in her communities no matter the obstacles. From my childhood to today, she has stepped up instead of waiting for someone else to fill the gap—whether it’s serving on a hospital board or organizing her bridge club. I admire how she continues to put herself out there, no matter her age! I am so fortunate to have her, Kate, and so many other examples of resilient women leaders around me, many of whom are colleagues of mine. I am grateful for their influence on me and others, and I celebrate the many pivotal roles women play in all our lives. Never miss a story"
What’s next in nursing? Meet the McKinsey RNs working to find out.,"For International Nurses Day, a look at our new survey that explores how COVID-19 has reshaped nursing.",2021-05-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/what%20do%20nurses%20want%20a%20stronger%20voice/nurses-hero-fullcol-1202320516-1536x864.jpg,"Healthcare,COVID-19",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/what-do-nurses-want-a-stronger-voice,"What’s next in nursing? Meet the McKinsey RNs working to find out. May 12, 2021 Who do you trust the most? If you or a loved one has received medical treatment in the last year, it may very well be a nurse. For the 19th year in a row, according to a recent Gallup Poll, nurses were ranked as the most trusted and ethical of 15 professions. In fact, even as they came through the pandemic—their toughest year in the survey’s history—nurses’ approval rating rose another 4 percent. But that reputation is hard earned, and our latest research indicates that it may soon come at a cost. Twenty-two percent of nurses say they may leave their current position providing direct patient care within the next year, according to our newest survey of 400+ frontline nurses. We spoke with Gretchen Berlin, RN, to find out more; she is a McKinsey senior partner who led the research and has degrees in nursing and business from the University of Pennsylvania. Let’s start with your background and what inspired you to become a nurse. I grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. My mom was a professional opera singer and my dad was a high school principal. My older brother was born very prematurely, and as we grew up, his care team of nurses came to each milestone of his life, checking in on him at various points. I was always intrigued by the close relationships that they had built, and that inspired me to pursue a clinically oriented profession. Also, both my grandmothers had been nurses. One was a young widow who supported her family as a nurse and the other was a psych nurse who ended up marrying the doctor who had helped her manage a patient in distress. Some people may be surprised to know we have nurses and other frontline healthcare workers here at McKinsey. Why do they join the firm and what do they do here? Yes, we have a growing community of nurses in a variety of roles: leading our Center for US Healthcare Reform , working in professional development to help colleagues map out careers, building capabilities with clients through our Implementation Practice , and serving in our Social Sector Practice . We also have a large number of physicians and other clinicians, like pharmacists. I believe a lot of them find that there are multiple ways to have impact on people’s lives, either one-on one with patients and families or at a larger-scale at the systems level. Both are needed and valuable, and McKinsey is an amazing way to achieve the latter. This survey looked at nurses after a very tough year fighting COVID-19, which contributed to some nurses saying they were more likely to leave their current positions. What other changes has the pandemic created in the profession? On the brighter side, 17 percent of respondents say that they will be staying in nursing because of their experience during COVID-19. We don’t know all of the reasons—it may be partially due to economic reasons—but we think it is partly due to the very gratifying experience they had in helping patients and their families; support they received from management and communities; and the pride they have in being nurses. The opportunity for organizations now is to engage their nurses in ways that will encourage them to stay and grow. This is where some of the innovations we saw during COVID-19 may come in. One example is technology. In some areas, hospitals accelerated the uses of tech devices at the bedside that could integrate with patient records: tablets for communication, and other forms of virtual monitoring. About two-thirds of nurses say they are very interested in opportunities to provide remote patient care in the future. Which of these innovations has the greatest potential to endure going forward?’ I believe the technology is here to stay and the pace of adoption will only increase. I think the real nut we have to crack is how to seamlessly integrate these advances into the workflow and change our care model around them, rather than just having the technology be one more thing in terms of cost and burden a nurse needs to deal with every day. What would you do as CEO of a healthcare organization to show your nursing staff that you support them? I would give nurses as much of a voice as possible in the governance of their hospital or clinic. They should have input to any aspect of a health system that affects their work, from hiring of team members, to supplies, to workflow. And I would do everything in my power to ensure they have the staffing support and time to provide this input. We know there is a correlation between patient and employee experience; the more satisfied your care team, the better your patient experience as well. What would you tell someone who is considering entering nursing as a profession today? Nursing offers an amazing ability to positively affect people’s lives either one-on-one in frontline positions or on a larger scale when working at the system level. It teaches you skills in empathy and communications, which are invaluable in all aspects of your life. And at this point, it basically provides permanent job security. In the earliest days of the pandemic, when urgency was high but our knowledge about the virus was low, nurses and frontline healthcare workers heroically cared for patients. What did you see in the profession at that time that most inspired you? I was so inspired to see what nurses and nursing leaders did at all levels—classmates who went from the OR to full-time ICU nurses in New York City; clients who filmed training videos in their hallways for nurses to rapidly learn how to support respiratory interventions. Their bravery and can-do attitude really shone. I am extremely grateful to our nurses who have been running to the fire since day one and continuing to care for patients and our communities today. related In Italy and beyond, Generation upskills thousands of healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19 A McKinsey doctor returns to her roots to fight COVID-19 Never miss a story"
Making It Work:  An office leader on helping 300 colleagues go remote—and the conversation that kept her in the workforce,"We’re talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work over the last year—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the pandemic has shaped their outlook on life and work.",2021-05-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/making-it-work-on-helping-300-colleagues-go-remote,"Making It Work:  An office leader on helping 300 colleagues go remote—and the conversation that kept her in the workforce May 19, 2021 The pandemic has disproportionately affected women. In our Women in the Workplace research last year, 1 in 4 of them said they were considering taking a step back in their careers or leaving the workforce entirely. A year after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, we began talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the pandemic has shaped their outlook on life and work. Here, Gosia Gontarz, a client-capabilities hub director based in Wroclaw, talks about transitioning 300 colleagues to remote work, the power of strong sponsors, and learning to take care of herself during unprecedented times. On the moment the pandemic felt real: I recall it very clearly: Poland went into lockdown on a Friday, and we needed to—within literally hours—make a decision about closing down our office and getting our colleagues prepared to work remotely starting the following Monday—which we had never done before. It was a massive undertaking for our IT leader, but she handled it with incredible poise. Our office is one of McKinsey’s client capabilities hubs, comprising experts in around 30 capabilities supporting clients in everything from McKinsey Analytics to McKinsey Academy , so it was very important for us to still be able to deliver those skills to clients amid the lockdown. When we first shut down, we had no idea how long it would be for. Weeks? Months? We didn’t know. Some people were excited about the pivot—they saw it as a real experiment. I’d say the first three months were most difficult. First, because lockdown was longer than we anticipated. And second, because some people didn’t have enough space at home to work effectively, and we also had colleagues who had to look after their parents and families. When summer came around, you could tell people really felt better. Let’s be honest: I think the sunshine offered some energy and hope, and the restrictions also eased up a little so people could travel. But also, we were able to open our office with appropriate COVID-19 restrictions and in accordance with local guidelines, so people who really needed the office space were able to have that. On almost leaving her role—and the advice from a sponsor that changed her mind: I am a working mother, and my partner also works. We have three small kids; the oldest one is six years old and the youngest is two and a half now. The beginning was really challenging because the entire support system—school, grandparents, childcare—that enabled us to do what we do suddenly disappeared. It was one of the hardest times I’ve faced in McKinsey, honestly. As the office leader, I felt I needed to be there for the community, to reassure and support those who were very afraid. But I was having the same struggles myself. There were moments when I thought I couldn’t do it anymore, and I reached out to my manager to tell him just that. He gave me probably the best advice I ’ ve heard: “ You can’t help the others if you don’t look after yourself. ” This was the “ aha ” moment for me. I realized I was absolutely not looking after myself in all of this. I was just looking after our office community, our people, and after my family. But there was no me in there. And this was the moment when I said, “ Okay, I can ’ t do it anymore because I am not looking after myself. Let me figure out a plan for myself as well. ” A big part of that plan was getting help from the team we ’ ve built in the office, which represents various cells. This team did a great job, and I couldn ’ t have done it without them. On the practices that helped her through difficult moments — and that will come with her into the next normal: First of all I realized that I don’t need to do everything over Zoom. You know, before the pandemic, we used to have phone calls as well. ( Laughs. ) So I try to pick up the phone when it’s not critical to have a face-to-face conversation, or if I don’t need to view documents at the same time. And you know what? There has not been a single time I’ve suggested a call that I didn’t hear a “thank you” from the other person. After my conversation with my manager, I started looking after my mental health more—looking at the moments when I was getting too much on my plate. Also, even though it’s still challenging to have a proper holiday, I do try and make sure I take time off every now and then to unplug, rest, and recharge. I truly believe the more understanding we have, as organizations, about the challenges we’re all going through—as women, as mothers, as partners—the better we’ll be able to address them through empathy and creativity.

It was one of the most horrifying examples of an alarming international trend that year. We have since updated the article. Amid a decline in hate crimes generally, those committed against Asian Americans rose by nearly 150 percent in major U.S. cities in 2020. And police data in the U.K. indicate a 300 percent rise in hate crimes towards people of Asian descent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in the previous two years. As stark as these numbers are, they don't capture the fear, anger, and grief Asian communities are feeling. In this feature, 72 Asian colleagues at McKinsey raise their voices and share their stories—on what Asian identity means, what allies can do to support them, and how they’re processing this moment. As we share these stories, we acknowledge our colleagues only represent a part of the conversation, a part of the Asian experience. To that end, we hope readers will find, listen to, and amplify the Asian voices in their own communities and beyond. Family Last week, I told my mom and dad not to walk the dog too far in their own neighborhood. Fear & Violence I didn't step outside of my apartment for three months during quarantine—not because of COVID but because of hate crimes toward Asians after hearing my friend got hit on the street in New York. Allyship & Support It's like years, decades, centuries of people telling you your problems aren't real problems. Identity I grew up in San Francisco. The recent Asian attacks brought back my fear and anxiety from 30 years ago, when my sister and I were attacked at Stonestown Mall in broad daylight. I worry a lot about my elderly parents and the possible violence against them, with my dad still in Chinatown to this day. And as a single mom, how do I keep my kids safe? History My family is from South Asia. So while we haven’t suffered from the recent wave of anti-Asian prejudice, the events have reminded me of the time after September 11th, 2001. That’s when my siblings and I were constantly called ‘terrorists’ in school, we were always stopped for extra screening at the airport, and my mom was told to go back to Saudi Arabia in the grocery store in front of her children."

Adam has been recognized by Forbes as one of the world’s 10 most influential business thinkers and is a leading expert on helping people find meaning and motivation in their lives. In his latest book, Think Again: The Power of Knowing What you Don’t Know , he makes the case for greater flexibility in our views—and offers tactics for leading discussions that may help others do the same. This conversation was part of a new discussion series for McKinsey partners and clients called “Modern Leadership,” which is designed to explore new dimensions of leadership with experts and leading thinkers who can help strengthen, challenge, and stretch our ability to build resilient teams and thrive in uncertain times. Read on for edited highlights from the session. On embracing “better practices” over “best practices” One of the things that scares me in a lot of organizations is how attached people become to best practices. They might’ve been the best at the time that you created them. But as the world around you changes, as your culture evolves, what was best five years, 10 years ago may not be what’s most productive today. I think the language of best practices creates this illusion that there ’ s an end point, that we’ve already reached perfection. And so we don ’ t need to change anything. What I would love to see more organizations do instead is to strive for better practices, right? To say, “Okay, you know what? No matter how good a practice becomes it can always be improved. And we’re open to trying whatever ideas you have for trying to evolve the way that we do things around here.” On leading with humility It sounds like low self-esteem or having a low opinion of yourself or being meek. That’s not actually what humility is. If you go back to the Latin roots, one of them means ‘from the earth.’ Being humble is about being grounded, recognizing that you’re only human, that you’re fallible. And I think it takes real confidence to say, “You know what? Here are the things I’m not good at. Here are the questions that I don’t have answers to. Here’s what I don’t know. Here’s where I was wrong.” What the research shows consistently is that leaders who are secure enough in their strengths to admit their weaknesses and vulnerabilities actually get better ideas from the people around them, they learn more, and that ultimately enables them to lead more effectively. I think the balance of confidence and humility is to say: These are not opposite ends of a see-saw. These are actually states that can go hand-in-hand. Confidence is believing that you can do great things. Humility is knowing that you don’t always have the knowledge and skills to do them yourself. On reading emotions like data My colleague Sigal Barsade is probably the world’s leading expert on emotional intelligence at work. One of the things she always reminds me is that emotions are data. When you see what other people are feeling, that’s information about what their motivations are, what’s occupying a lot of their energy and attention. Without that information, you’re actually handicapped as a leader. At the same time, if you never show any emotion, that’s a signal that you lack passion—that, you know, that you’re incapable of really connecting to the challenges of the moment. And so I think as someone who loves data and as somebody who tends to be left-brained, this idea that emotions are data has made me a lot more comfortable bringing them to the table. On “thinking like a scientist” For me, thinking like a scientist means you don ’ t let your ideas become your identity. There was a recent experiment with startup founders in Italy that shows the value of teaching businesspeople to think like scientists. Half the founders are put in a control group. Nothing unusual happens to them. The other half are taught to just think like scientists. They’re told, “Your strategy for your company, that’s a theory. When you talk to customers, that ’ s a way to home in on specific hypotheses. And then when you launch a product or a service, just think of that as an experiment to test your hypotheses.” Over the next year, on average, the entrepreneurs who had been randomly assigned to learn to think like scientists brought in more than 40 times the revenue of the control group. That is a massive effect. And the major mechanism behind it is those entrepreneurs were more than twice as likely to pivot. They ended up looking for reasons why they might’ve been wrong instead of just the reasons that they must've been right. They listened to the perspectives that made them think hard, not just the ones that made them feel good. And they surrounded themselves with people who challenged their thought process, not just the ones who challenged their conclusions. I think that's the art of thinking like a scientist.

The BEDF is part of LISC’s Project 10X , a $1 billion strategy to address racial gaps in health, wealth, and opportunity. McKinsey’s contribution, along with those of 10 public corporations, has helped the fund hit its goal of raising $250 million in capital to invest in Black-owned financial institutions, businesses, real estate developers, and anchor institutions across the US. Earlier this week, the BEDF announced its first projects, all of which include building capacity at Black-owned banks and making loans to community-based real estate developers to help support economic opportunity in Black communities and close the racial wealth gap. In Columbia, South Carolina, for example, the fund will be making a $4 million deposit in the century-old Optus Bank, which invests 90 percent of its loans in under-financed communities and minority-owned businesses. Optus has a strategy to build $100 million in Black wealth over 10 years. Meanwhile in Pittsburgh, the fund will provide short-term pre-development financing of $1.5 million, the single missing piece of capital, to support Bridging the Gap’s mixed-income 171-apartment development on one of the largest housing sites in the city. And in Houston, BEDF will make a $3 million deposit to Unity National Bank, the only Black-owned bank in Texas, to grow its small business investments and pursue partnerships in affordable housing. The fund expects to announce as many as 20 additional project investments by year end. These businesses will greatly benefit from gaining access to the flexible capital they need to grow. “ The BEDF identifies and invests in minority-owned institutions and their communities, creating economic opportunities, developing housing and improving quality of life,” says Eric Kutcher, McKinsey senior partner and chief financial officer. “This critical financing allows them to turn a corner and grow, laying the groundwork for other investors and organizations to follow.” This partnership is part of our broader commitment to fight racism and social inequity... Community context is a critical factor in closing the racial wealth gap, according to our research , which found that 65 percent of the Black population is concentrated in 16 states that rank below the national averages in economic opportunity, employment, healthcare access and quality, and broadband access. “The BEDF’s targeted financing can energize Black businesses and communities and create a multiplier effect,” Eric adds. “This partnership is part of our broader commitment to fight racism and social inequity, as exemplified in our 10 actions to combat racism announced last year. We will draw on our strengths and expertise to help advance racial equity and social justice within our firm and throughout our communities.” related What will it take to build more Black-owned businesses?

June 4, 2021 Kris Tompkins has dedicated her life to business and the planet. As CEO of Patagonia, she helped build a company that was both financially successful and a leader on environmental causes. As president of Tompkins Conservation, she used her private sector expertise— with support from our colleagues —to help Chile create one of the largest protected areas on the planet. On the heels of our new sustainability commitments and the launch of McKinsey Sustainability —we invited Kris to speak to our colleagues and share some lessons she has learned throughout her long career in both the private sector and as a nonprofit leader. In the edited interview below, conducted by Tony Hansen, director of McKinsey’s Global Infrastructure Initiative and a leader in our Nature Analytics service line , Kris shares her story and talks about climate change, biodiversity loss, and how calls for action—ranging from decarbonization to net zero commitments to conserving vast swathes of nature—continue to grow. What brought about your epiphany to preserve and rewild vast swathes of land, and what gave you the courage to act? Like everything in life, it was an organic process. You notice something, then you get more involved. You meet people you wouldn’t have met before. I grew up in a milieu of serious adventurers. I met Yvon Chouinard (founder of Patagonia) when I was 15. My late husband, Doug Tompkins (co-founder, North Face, Esprit), was a climber and a world-class kayaker. In the early years, we didn’t really understand was happening to the natural world. But by the early ’80s, it became clear that it was really coming under attack. After Doug left the business world, he had the idea of buying up large tracts of land and just protecting them. When I left Patagonia, we moved to a remote area in south Chile and used our finances to get started. At first, we didn’t have this grand plan to create national parks. But not long after that, we decided that this was something we could do. It changed our lives forever. It changed a lot of people’s lives forever. Through Tompkins Conservation, you collectively helped protect 14.5 million acres of land and coastal areas. How did your private sector experience help prepare you for that chapter? First of all, I was working with Yvon Chouinard and married to Doug Tompkins, two truly entrepreneurial and visionary people. They taught me two important things. The first is that nothing is impossible. And the second is that, if you’re going to go for something, you have to commit—then you figure it out. If you never commit to something until you have it all dialed in, and you can see how it’s all going to unfold, you’ll never start. Next to those two, I was sort of the boring one. I made the trains run on time and thought about the budgets. But there was an alchemy there. Between their visionary style and my results-oriented brain, we really had something that was special. Tompkins Conservation coined the phrase “rewilding.” How does your strategy for reintroducing animals into the wild fit in with your conservation? About 15 years ago, we realized that we had some conservation projects in which a lot of keystone species were missing. And we had to ask ourselves what we were going to do about that. As someone once said, “Landscape without wildlife is just scenery.” We couldn’t just protect the land and walk away, because what would we be leaving behind? What’s two million acres of wetlands with no jaguars, no pumas? Now, we’ve worked on rewilding about 13 species. We have jaguars back in their southern-most territory in Argentina for the first time in 90 years. We have red-shouldered macaws flying in the same region for the first time in 100 years. You need these animals for conservation to have its full impact on local, regional, and national communities. Rewilding territory and rewilding species is a highly complex goal, but a necessary one. We also need to rewild ourselves. Communities are forever linked to the goodness and health of the nature around them. How do you view the state of conservation today? Only a very small percentage of philanthropic dollars goes towards conservation. Imagine what could be done if more individuals and, more importantly, more institutions took the long view of the planet and their place in it. Businesses have a big role to play. There are a lot of good companies out there. But so what? Today, companies need to be great to stand out. They have to up the bar on themselves. Who wants to work for a company that doesn’t want to be great? We know too much about the state of the environment to settle for less. McKinsey Sustainability What do you think the private sector can do differently on conservation? That’s a big question. I’ve only worked for one company my entire life. But I know that the great limiting factor in any business or institution is a lack of bravery. Instead of just looking at all the pitfalls that can happen—if it’s controversial, or it may be unpopular—eventually you need to put that to the side and just do it. What’s the worst that can happen? If you’re successful in leading on this issue, you’re going to change our global future. If you’re not—this stuff is fun. This isn’t drudgery. People want to work for companies who care and where they can do something they believe in. If it’s a gas working at your day job, and part of your day job is changing the world… who wouldn’t go for that? So if I were running a company still today, I wouldn’t hesitate to stick my paw out there and get involved in this. You have to try to change the end of this story. Only then will you be a company that’s never forgotten. Do you have any advice or inspiration to leave us with? Take the tools you’re given, take the talent you have, and use them for something. You may think you don’t know what to do, or how to contribute. But I think you do. We’re past the moment where inaction is acceptable. That’s not me preaching. That’s just where we are. That’s it. related How green waste management led to COVID-19 relief in Buenos Aires Never miss a story"

Meet a researcher who’s finding out. June 16, 2021 Ask someone about what they’re most excited to do when life begins to normalize, and you’re likely to get a range of answers: a trip, a family reunion, a dance party, a favorite restaurant. As people start to get out and about, digital use is expected to drop across all industries except for travel and banking, according to a new McKinsey survey of some 29,000 consumers across 24 countries. “We crave being outside, seeing loved ones, and getting hugs,” explains Neira Hajro, a McKinsey partner who led the research. A native of Bosnia, Neira has worked with McKinsey in both New York and now in London, where she serves startups and helps clients with their digital transformations. “As the world opens and consumers have more choices, they will move to a hybrid model, combining pre-pandemic preferences for physical channels with the digital knowledge and sophistication they've acquired over the last 18 months,” she reports. What does this mean for businesses going forward? She explained in a recent conversation excerpted here. Let’s start on a personal note. You were born and raised in Bosnia. Yes, I grew up Sarajevo. My dad was a professor in the university and my mum was an executive at an energy company. During the war from 1992 to 1995, my family, including my sister with whom I am very close, stayed there because we love our country. My parents made the decision. I was 13 at the time, and none of us knew what war looked or felt like. After the war, when I was 17, I got a scholarship to attend school in the US. I still remember that first time on a plane by myself. I landed on a Saturday,  started school on Tuesday, and took my first calculus test on Wednesday. After a year, the lovely family I was staying with in Virginia convinced me to go to university in America. I received a full scholarship to MIT, where I earned a master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science. In 2004, I joined McKinsey and worked in New York for six years. I then moved to London because I wanted to be closer to my family, spent some time at Google, and rejoined McKinsey in London in 2016. We conducted this survey in April 2021, a turning point in COVID-19, as a few countries were starting to open up. Which findings surprised you most? In the last six months of the pandemic, we saw nearly 70 million more people across Europe use digital services for the first time, with almost seven million in the UK alone, and they were not just the 18 to 35 age group glued to their screens. We saw older generations get online for food shopping, doctor appointments, talking to grandchildren, and more. We experienced the equivalent of five years of digital growth in eight weeks of time. In that sense, we jumped from 2020 to 2025. This was amazing. But based on our survey results, consumers say they think that they will slip back to their pre-pandemic habits, doing less online. They are not turning off completely, just doing less. But we believe businesses have the opportunity to keep some of those valuable online consumers. Tell us more about these new digital converts. They became savvy very quickly. As we were all on lockdown, consumers began investing in their homes—we call it ""nesting behaviors""—buying furniture, electronic equipment, groceries, outdoor items. They were forced to try new brands beyond the local physical world of goods and had new digital experiences, which caused them to become more discerning. In this borderless digital world, they also moved beyond their local environments to experience best-in-class events, resources, and expertise. Students from Denmark dialed into MIT for lectures. Patients consulted with medical specialists from around the world. Music fans everywhere were able to watch the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra perform live, from their living rooms. The bar is much higher now for any business: they must compete digitally on a global level, not just a local one. What can businesses do to hold onto their new digital customers as physical channels beckon? They'll need to innovate so they can give these newly sophisticated consumers what they say they want: a better user experience. This includes inspiring trust that their personal data is safe. It also means providing more complete, helpful product information online. And it means ensuring that users can easily move across channels: research products online; see and try them out in the store or at a physical location; go back online to complete the purchase and manage after-sales details, such as tracking and warranties; and return the item, if necessary, in-store. This seamless experience requires access to human help at critical points in the buying process. Industries can innovate by learning from each other. For example, grocery stores and healthcare may pick up lessons from banking, which tends to offer best-in-class data security. What’s next for digital consumers Many companies have struggled this year. Have you seen any bright spots? Yes. A number of our clients who were faltering in their digital transformations were able to accomplish them during the pandemic. It became really clear that transformations, which undoubtedly are very hard to achieve, can be hindered by internal reasons: siloed teams, lack of agreement on goals, uncertainty about direction, inconsistent commitment. The pandemic swept away a lot of these issues, and we saw a number of transformations suddenly gain momentum and succeed. What ’ s the big takeaway for business leaders in all this? Some digital habits and usage will decrease, but there will be clear gains that will last. For business leaders, now is a very exciting time in digital because there is so much to do. We can iterate quickly because tech is cheap and fast. We can test with customers for feedback, innovate, and roll out the sorts of capabilities—improved privacy, seamless channels, thoughtful human intervention—that provide a more effective, sophisticated digital experience. It is a very nice flywheel. related How might daily life, and daily spending habits, change after COVID-19? Never miss a story"
Delivering on our purpose during an extraordinary year,"Our latest social responsibility report lays out how our 34,000 colleagues joined together through acts big and small to deliver on our purpose in 2020.",2021-06-17T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/2020%20social%20responsibility%20report/socialrespreport-hero-small-triptych-1536x864-new.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/2020-social-responsibility-report,"Delivering on our purpose during an extraordinary year June 17, 2021 Without question, 2020 was an extraordinary year for everyone—our colleagues, our clients, and the people and communities we seek to help, all over the world. For us at McKinsey, what came through was how our 34,000-plus colleagues joined together through acts big and small to deliver on our purpose, which is to help create positive, enduring change in the world. Our annual Social Responsibility Report shares stories about the ways we did that, from supporting our colleagues to work on the frontlines of medical care to supporting leaders across public, private, and social sectors through timely advice and insights on how to adapt to the realities of the pandemic and plan for recovery. Our social impact in 2020 was defined by how we showed up for each other, for our clients, and for the future of our planet. Helping to safeguard lives and livelihoods Our COVID-related work helped clients across sectors respond to many complex challenges presented by the pandemic, from keeping employees safe and businesses running to working with education systems on learning continuity, especially for vulnerable students. From Asia to Europe to North America, we deepened our financial and pro bono support to organizations helping communities and individuals most affected by the pandemic on issues like food insecurity, underemployment, and unemployment. Closer to home, we helped our employees adjust to our changed working lives by offering more flexible working arrangements and back-up childcare and eldercare services. 2020 Social Responsibility Report We created the COVID Response Center , an online hub for practical resources, tools, and data to help leaders, organizations, and communities respond to and recover from the changing conditions of the pandemic. The government leaders we supported through client work represent approximately 1.8 billion people. And some of our most ambitious social investments—like Generation and Rethinking Recycling , nonprofits we helped create and continue to support—were able to direct resources and services towards COVID-19 relief. Working toward racial and social equity McKinsey has a deep and longstanding commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in business, in society, and within our firm. The events of 2020, however, highlighted how much more work we all must do to make real progress. As we reflected on the events unfolding in our communities and listened to the diverse voices of our colleagues advocating for greater racial and social equity, McKinsey publicly committed to 10 Actions to promote anti-racism and social equity with our clients, in our communities, and within our firm. We recognize that much work lies ahead  and that concrete actions need to take root before progress happens. In 2020, our actions included training more than 7,000 executives from more than 350 organizations through our Black Leadership Academy , provided at no cost to participants. And, we organized a day of service dedicated to understanding racial inequity and giving back to more than 360 organizations focused on addressing equity challenges. Charting a net-zero future to protect the planet McKinsey has made tremendous progress over the last few years in reducing our carbon footprint and helping ourselves and our clients take measurable steps towards greater sustainability. Most recently, we stepped up our efforts to support clients on their sustainability journeys by launching McKinsey Sustainability , a dedicated client practice area to help public, private, and social-sector clients drive innovation and advance sustainability in areas related to environmental conservation and climate change. In 2020, we published over 100 thought pieces on sustainability challenges and the role of climate action to transition to the next normal, and hosted our eighth annual Global Sustainability Summit, convening (virtually) more than 600 leaders from the private, public, and social sectors.  In 2020, we set even more ambitious targets by committing to reaching net-zero climate impact as a firm by 2030, with validated science-based targets for 2025 in line with a 1.5-degree pathway. Looking ahead to the future While we made important progress last year, we know that delivering on our purpose is an ongoing journey, one that involves our colleagues, our clients, and other stakeholders. To that end, we have committed to providing $2 billion in cash and in-kind support towards social responsibility efforts by 2030. In the next decade, we will share the results and stories generated from these commitments.

"A new McKinsey council identifies today’s top tech trends for business leaders
","Our new Technology Council, comprised of primarily external experts, identifies the tech trends that are most relevant to business leaders.",2021-06-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20council%20identifies%20ten%20tech%20trends%20to%20watch/techtrends-hero-small-1193074985-1536x864.jpg,"Innovation,Digital,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-council-identifies-ten-tech-trends-to-watch,"A new McKinsey council identifies today’s top tech trends for business leaders June 24, 2021 Technology and digital have long been near the top of the CEO’s strategic agenda. But often today, technology is the business strategy. In the past few years, astonishing advances in data availability and computational power have been laying a foundation for the rapid development and convergence of a number of new technologies that will upend almost every industry. We can see robots writing their own software or running “lights out” factories. Biomachines helping to restore sight to the blind and movement to the paralyzed. The implications for corporations are broad, to say the least. To help leaders understand this noisy and shifting landscape, we assembled a coalition of experts to form McKinsey ’ s Technology Council. It includes 60+ members—scientists, engineers, investors, entrepreneurs, and others from external technology organizations and institutions, along with a dozen of our engineering, data science, and integrative consulting colleagues. “We believe the technology disruption over the next few years will be equal to the industrial revolution,” says Nicolaus Henke , senior partner emeritus who leads the council. “We need to be on top of these trends for ourselves and our clients so they can identify the innovations that will radically transform their businesses. What better way to do this than to collaborate with the world’s leading technologists?” We believe the technology disruption over the next few years will be equal to the industrial revolution. The first research output of this effort has just been published. The Tech Trends Index identifies the 10 technology trends most relevant to creating a competitive advantage and to evaluate in terms of  investments. “While they may not be the coolest or newest,” explains Ivan Ostojic, a partner who led the work, “they should matter the most to business leaders.” As part of the research, the council examined more than 80 fundamental technologies, grouped into ~40 tech clusters, to identify the 10 major trends. Each tech cluster is ranked based on the breadth of impact, maturity, and a “momentum score,” which measures how quickly they are maturing. The momentum score is comprised of factors such as venture capital investment, number of patent filings, number of use cases across industries, level of attention in science and business media, and technology maturity. Comparing composite momentum scores with factors such as applicability to an industry and tech maturity will help executives determine how much disruption a trend is likely to cause and when it will have business implications. A leader can look across the ten trends—for example, distributed infrastructure or next-generation computing—and identify the two or three most relevant to his or her industry. The report details the underlying technologies for each, including current applications, future potential use cases, and their timelines. For example, if quantum computing is high in terms of how it will apply to an industry and lower on technical maturity, with a lower momentum score, what does this mean for an executive?  He or she will have to look at how a technology will change the fundamentals of  their industry. In chemicals and pharmaceuticals R&D, quantum computing will recreate the process of inventing new molecules within the next five to ten years, so a leader will have to invest in this new technology sooner rather than later. On the other hand, in both the financial services and entertainment industries, Software 2.0, in which neural networks write code instead of programmers, is already significantly accelerating model design and deployment today. “The research forms the basis for eye-opening discussions with leaders about the risks and opportunities of technology for their business,” says Kate Smaje , a senior partner who leads McKinsey Digital . “Leaders will need to quickly determine the combined impact of these trends on their companies, industries and value chains or risk being late on the S curve.” The research forms the basis for eye-opening discussions with leaders about the risks and opportunities of technology for their business. The Tech Trends Index, to be updated annually, will be followed by a cross-industry strategy guide that explains step by step how to develop and integrate emerging technologies into an organization, followed by industry-specific outlooks. Meanwhile, the council, a firm-wide initiative intended to operate like a technology think tank, will continue its work developing research and conducting experiments with emerging technologies while convening the world’s leading thinkers. “In our earliest days, leaders from organizations focused on computing and machine learning, from major enterprises to smaller startups, began sharing their findings informally and explored new ways of automating code writing,” recalls Nico. “In fact, it was conversations among the council about the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) agents at scale that laid the foundation for our AI work in the America's Cup .” Never miss a story"
What&rsquo;s ahead for McKinsey?

A conversation with Bob Sternfels. July 1, 2021 Bob Sternfels begins his tenure as our 13th global managing partner today. We spoke with him to learn more about how he’s feeling, what he sees ahead for the profession, and how he’s thinking about leading McKinsey as we approach our second century. You were elected in March, and now it’s day one. How are you feeling? I’m feeling a mixture of humility and excitement. I feel humbled to have been asked to step into this role, and I’m very excited by the opportunity we have to help our clients be bold as they navigate their way out of the pandemic and beyond. I’m also feeling enormously grateful to my predecessor Kevin Sneader. What he accomplished for our clients and our firm during one of the world’s most challenging periods has given me the opportunity to lead a thriving organization of 34,000 great people working across the globe. What’s your view on the state of the consulting profession? Organizations are facing a confluence of unique external forces: the global pandemic recovery, a technology revolution that compressed 15 years of innovation into 15 months, climate change making its way onto every CEO’s agenda, and unique global geopolitical challenges. Leaders are looking for advisors who can help them successfully navigate these challenges. Because of this, there’s perhaps no better time to be a management consultant—and no better time to be a member of McKinsey & Company—than now. What does McKinsey stand for in this moment? If I step back and consider the impact our firm can have through the work we do for clients and our communities, my starting point is an ambition to stand for—and help realize—sustainable, inclusive growth. For instance, by helping our clients grow, I believe we can help them fuel economic growth in the communities in which they operate, lift people up, and speed the world’s recovery. By supporting innovation and upskilling, we can help economies close the income gap, enable diversity in the workforce, and help solve the looming human capital crunch. And through our new Sustainability Practice , which helps clients on sustainability-related topics, we can help combat climate change and help protect the environment while also spurring innovation. So, sustainable, inclusive growth—that’s what we stand for. Spurring global growth. Upskilling those who need it. Catalyzing decarbonization. It gets me excited. Recent insights from Bob Sternfels, McKinsey’s new global managing partner Let’s look ahead a little. At the end of your first year in the role, what changes would be in progress that would make you feel proud? One big thing I’d like to see is for McKinsey to be setting an example for how consulting firms can contribute to business and society. We begin with this notion of ‘holistic impact.’ The pandemic has created a unique macro-environment that our clients are navigating, and it’s our time to be bold and embolden them. Whether they have been successful—or battered—over the past 15 months, we can help them emerge stronger. At the same time, consultants can and should be a real force for good in the world. We can be the firm that helps our clients’ financial performance and positively impacts other stakeholders: employees, customers, workers, and society. That’s what we’re calling holistic impact.  And we want to ensure this holistic impact is sustained over time. I’d also like to see us doubling our rate of innovation to help our clients create and capture value faster. That will mean demonstrating innovation and excellence ourselves when it comes to our capabilities, our people, and our approaches to working with clients.  We will measure our innovation speed and hope to set the standard here. Finally, I’d like to see us recommit to apprenticeship as we emerge from our remote work settings. In one way, this will mean looking at how we can continue to improve the way we provide feedback, train, and support our people. And in another, more day-to-day context, many of our new colleagues have not yet experienced some of the simple things that make working at McKinsey special: seeing senior colleagues sitting side-by-side with their teammates to teach the art of the profession; being on the receiving end of an act of generosity from a sponsor; witnessing a more junior colleague contribute a breakthrough insight; or just having a coffee together in the office to catch up. We will recommit to these things and as a result we will deepen the trust we have in each other as colleagues. You mention trust. How do you plan to gain the trust of those who may be skeptical about McKinsey in this moment? I think trust is earned not given, and I think we earn trust by acting responsibly and consistently. That means we need to live our values and back them up with the best risk processes, teams, governance, and accountability measures. That was a priority for Kevin, and it remains a priority for me. And we will have these things in place while not slowing ourselves down. We can be faster and safer, through empowerment, engagement, transparency, and accountability. Finally, you embarked on a firm listening tour after your election. What did you hear? It was so inspiring to have a chance to do that. First and foremost, I heard about the determination and perseverance—the grit, to put it simply—our colleagues brought to their work and personal lives during one of the world’s most challenging periods. My grandmother was Finnish, and the Finns have a term for this; it’s called sisu .  We have sisu.  It will serve us well going forward. I also heard wonderful things about the impact we are having with clients that will stand the test of time, the quality of our talent, and the uniqueness of our innovations. Our clients trust us, and we have amazing people, all 34,000 of us. related Meet our next global managing partner: Bob Sternfels Never miss a story"
Lessons in leadership and well-being from Bill George,"The former Medtronic CEO and Harvard Business School professor joined McKinsey leaders for a conversation on how to create, protect, and grow well-being practices on our teams and in our lives.",2021-07-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/lessons%20in%20leadership%20and%20well-being%20from%20bill%20george/billgeorge-hero-small-collage-1536x864.jpg,Leadership Development,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/lessons-in-leadership-and-well-being-from-bill-george,"Lessons in leadership and well-being from Bill George July 6, 2021 “When I was 32, life was very stressful,” says Bill George. “I was traveling all the time, my wife was working, we had a young child at home, and another on the way. It was a very stressful time.” It’s perhaps a good thing that it was. To cope, Bill took a transcendental meditation course, which inspired a daily practice that the former Medtronic CEO and Harvard Business School professor continues to this day. His example has now inspired a generation of business and organizational leaders everywhere to embrace humble, authentic, and inclusive styles of leadership. In his recent book True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership , 125 of them share what they’ve learned through their successes, failures, and tragedies. Across the challenges of the past 15 months, we’ve seen many of our colleagues and clients embrace the importance of well-being. Our global leader of industry practices, Liz Hilton Segel , recently invited Bill to join McKinsey senior partners Manish Chopra and Ryan Davies for an in-depth conversation on well-being: how to create it, protect it, and grow it on our teams and in our lives. In the edited excerpts that follow, we share some of Bill’s most memorable insight and advice from the session. Authentic leadership and well-being Leaders need to adapt to the era. If they don’t adapt to the era they’re in, they will not be effective. But they need to do so authentically, and I think it does require a sense of well-being. To me, that’s what’s required to be a great leader. It’s not just something you do off the job, it’s something you do on the job. You can always tell when you’re engaging with someone whether they have that sense or whether they’re so stressed out they really aren’t focused on you. As a leader, you want to give encouragement to the people you work with to bring their ideas forth, to be real people, to be authentic and to be mindful and to have their own practices and give them the opportunity to do that. To do so, you have to take control of your schedule. I don’t care what your job is, you’ve got to take control of your schedule. And so you need to set aside things for mind, body, spirit—and encourage people who work for you or with you or around you or on your teams to have that schedule. Clarity and resilience through meditation I don’t think you can be really creative about big ideas if you’re working off a task list. You can’t think of original ideas until you clear away all that clutter and think about what’s really important and what the big picture is. A meditation practice can help you do that. As leaders, we’re going to get knocked down. Things are not going to go our way. You’re going to lose a client or a client’s going to be unhappy or something’s going to go wrong. Meditation gives me a sense of resilience, so I can come bouncing back. We all need that. And I can tell you the higher up you are, the more stress you feel. You need that sense of well-being and resilience. The power of community Each office is a community. Each group, each team you work on; it could involve people in five different offices, but that should be a team that works as a community and checks in with each other, even if only for a couple of minutes. “How are you doing? What's going on in your life?” So that there is a humanity there. That’s the authenticity people want. There’s a direct correlation between one simple question, which is, “Do you have a best friend at work,” and employee engagement scores. We want everyone to be fully engaged. So how do you get that engagement? Make everyone at your organization feel like, “This is my home. This is where I want to be, and you respect me for who I am.” When my wife had breast cancer, the support we got from the Medtronic community was incredible. And after she finished her chemo, seven months, eight months later I wrote a Thanksgiving Eve note to everyone. I used to write notes all the time about our business performance—no one responded. But to that note, I got 18,000 responses. People related to it. It was all about humanity. Leading today You lead from where you are. You don’t have to look for that next promotion. Wherever you are, you have that opportunity to step up and lead right now. Because we lead with teams today. It’s not about who you have control over. It's really much more about how you inspire people to come together with a common purpose and to come forth with really great ideas. If senior people are not authentic and don’t have a sense of purpose that can help early tenured people see, “Why am I working so hard?” those colleagues won’t bring their best to work and aren’t going to do what you’re asking them to do. For CEOs today, look, somebody else can run the numbers. You have plenty of people to run numbers. I had a great CFO. But I had to inspire people around the Medtronic mission and values. That’s the job for CEOs today.

In our Women in the Workplace research last year, 1 in 4 of them said they were considering taking a step back in their careers or leaving the workforce entirely. A year after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, we began talking to several McKinsey women about how they’ve made it work—the surprising challenges, unexpected joys, and how the pandemic has shaped their outlook on life and work. Here, Nadia Dua, an executive assistant based in Manila, talks about transitioning to remote work, talking to a mental health professional for the first time, and learning to take care of herself during unprecedented times. On the moment the pandemic felt real: I remember it clearly; it was March 15, 2020. I was already logged off from work, and we were having a group chat with my team of executive assistants in Manila. Then we learned a person in the building of our office had tested positive, so everyone was expected to work from home the next day. Luckily our leaders were thinking ahead so we already had our laptops with us to be able to work remotely. When I learned of the person testing positive, I thought the situation might get worse—and sure enough, it did. On navigating the pivot to remote work: It was challenging because McKinsey executive assistants typically work in the office. And personally, I don’t like working from home because I like the physical divide between work and life. Plus, I live in a small condo with my partner and our dog, and there were new protocols in our building that limited movement. That included only allowing pets to go out once a day. That wasn’t enough, so my partner would sometimes take our dog with her when she was grocery shopping, just so she could go out. The first month was okay, but after that, life started feeling very “bed to table” for me. We didn’t really have the space for the two of us to have different rooms for work and living. On the things that helped her get through the challenging times: I talked to a mental health professional for the first time during the pandemic, thanks to a benefit the firm offered. It may be much more normal in other communities or cultures, but in the Philippines, speaking to a psychiatrist or therapist can sometimes carry a heavy stigma. I found the sessions to be so helpful in sorting through what was going on in my head. It was wonderful to have someone help me ask better questions—and to give me support that this uncertainty was something I could endure. The most tactical advice that I got was breathing techniques, which helped me feel grounded, particularly in those moments where everything felt too overwhelming. On how the pandemic has changed her views on work and life: One of my favorite practical things the firm did to support us was offering reimbursement for office
equipment we needed at home. I got an ergonomic chair, which was good because most of our chairs at home
were not conducive for sitting for long hours in a day. Last week I was telling a friend who is looking for a
job to ask potential interviewers what their company did to care for their people during the pandemic. I think
that's going to show them if they’re heading to a good company. I’ve also adapted to the “bed to table” lifestyle and established a better routine. I commit to personal time blocks throughout the day to break up my work routine, like walking my dog at 4:30 p.m. every afternoon before finishing up emails. By 6:30 p.m., it’s family rosary time, and I’m usually winding down for the night by 9 p.m. Last year taught me to just have a lot more conversations—and to appreciate the different ways people think about things. More broadly, I have a new appreciation for people’s different mindsets. When the pandemic hit I immediately thought that everyone was aware that the situation would get worse before it could get better. For some reason I thought everyone would have the same mindset. Of course I was wrong. I came across a number of Filipinos who thought that COVID-19 was a scam while browsing the Department of Health’s Facebook page. Over the last year I've developed this genuine curiosity about people's thought processes, especially when they’re different from mine. Like, how did you arrive at this belief? What experiences led you to believe this? Last year taught me to just have a lot more conversations—and to appreciate the different ways people think about things. Never miss a story"
New Digital Capability Center in Italy prepares businesses for digital renaissance,"In the city of Venice, our newly expanded facility helps leaders see the future through an experience that is part tech expo, part science lab, part immersive theater.",2021-07-21T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20center%20in%20italy%20prepares%20businesses%20for%20digital%20renaissance/dccvenice-hero-small-center_1536x864.jpg,"Digital,Capability Building",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-center-in-italy-prepares-businesses-for-digital-renaissance,"New Digital Capability Center in Italy prepares businesses for digital renaissance Participants during a digital walkthrough at our newly expanded Digital Capability Center in Venice, an experience that helps leaders see what their digital future might look like and apply it in their own business. July 21, 2021 This summer in Venice, a city of museums and art galleries, we have hosted openings at our Digital Capability Center for Operations. It’s a gallery, of sorts, showcasing the future of transformational business technology. Some 1000+ guests have toured the newly expanded center, including the media, local and global business leaders, and tech experts, for both in-person and virtual tours that demonstrate how technology will be changing the way businesses run. Part tech expo, part science lab, part immersive theater, the center replicates the end-to-end operations of a fictitious company that manufactures compressors for household appliances. Under tremendous pressure to improve sales and reduce costs, the model company’s three divisions have implemented 100+ advanced digital technologies, which seamlessly weave through every function, from front-end sales through its far-flung supply chain. The Digital Capability Center is one way we are helping industries prepare for the next normal. Companies experienced as much as five years of digital growth in two months during the pandemic. They launched new online channels, digitized entire business segments, and equipped their employee populations for remote work. As they look to further advance their digitization and transform their operations, the center can help them literally see what the future might look like and apply it in their own business. Teams can observe how augmented reality can reinvent product design and see AI bots run CRM systems, robots assemble products, digital twins guide component repair, and analytics drive the dashboards that inform management decisions. “Any operations transformation is as much about people as it is about technology, requiring changes to the human side at all levels of the organization,” says Dinu de Kroon , the partner leading McKinsey’s Digital Capability Centers in Europe . “That’s why McKinsey has expanded this center, so that we can inspire people with a view to the future and help them develop the right skills, mindsets, and behaviors needed to embrace a successful transformation.” This new expansion was built with the Confindustria Alto Adriatico, an organization representing 150,000 manufacturing and service companies in Italy. It is enhanced with an ecosystem of some 100+ technology partners and startups. “We are technology agnostic,” explains Sergio Farioli , a McKinsey partner, “so we can bring a wide range of capabilities into our learning scenarios.” In addition to digital transformations and design-to-value labs , the center runs innovation workshops in which businesses can collaborate with a variety of partners to create new products and services, and it will launch a program focused on sustainability in operations. “Our immersive experience is what really makes a difference: trained actors and coaches play the roles of operators and senior executives,” explains Cinzia Lacopeta , leader of the European Digital Capability Centers. “We spend a lot of time up front working with the consultant who is bringing in the group so we can develop before-and-after scenarios, simulations and debriefs that reflect their own real working situations.” Participants will interact with our trained actors who recreate the challenges and mistakes they may be experiencing in their own companies, whether it’s using an outdated manual process or attitudes that are resistant to change, a common occurrence in transformation work. They see demos of how the technology can be applied to not just solve a problem but generate a quantum leap in terms of impact, and build the skills needed to encourage and enact change. Digital Capability Center Venice While participants come away with enhanced digital skills, leaders say the most important takeaways are new mindsets: curiosity and creative thinking about alternative approaches; flexible attitudes about roles; new ways of defining success. “We say mindsets and behaviors are important in our workshops, but I can't emphasize this enough,” observes one leader who is managing the digital transformation of a major CPG company. “As we launched the first wave of skills building, our people were helpful, attentive, and we developed six new use cases. But throughout the second wave, the reaction was much more proactive: thinking about how to apply tech and operational excellence in their own areas. The challenge is how to create enthusiasm and inspire this inquisitive, open thinking - if we can do this, we should bottle it.” The team that built the new center did some capability building of their own during the construction, which trebled the size of the original footprint. They broke ground during the pandemic in May of 2020 . “We had 30 people, from India to Iceland. We knew we needed to work safely while keeping to our original schedule, so we pulled in our Capital Excellence experts who  helped the architects, engineers, and construction team implement an overall building information modeling process (BIM) so we could bring in digital tools,” explains Sebastian Overlack , a McKinsey partner who led the project. These included a digital control tower to enhance collaboration and create a common source of truth. The team used drones and fixed and hand-held scanners to capture 3-D images of the site to ensure accuracy and feed into the reporting dashboards, and used sensor-based technology to enhance worker safety. “We were very much ‘eating our own cooking,’” says Sebastian, with a laugh. In addition to European-based enterprises, the center actively serves the smaller and medium-size businesses of the region and has built a strong presence Venice. ""We have a social mission to develop the digital skills of 1,000 students every year, from high school up to post-graduate level,” explains Cinzia. “This ranges from learning how to use analytics to develop very simple algorithms to managerial skills and programming a collaborative robot. We are committed to developing our next generation of digital experts.” Starting in September, the Center will host programs for organizations who want to qualify for the Global Lighthouse Network , helping  participants understand the criteria and create a roadmap to become one of the most advanced digital factories in the world. related ‘Factory of the future’ opens in Singapore Never miss a story"
"Through education and cricket, building hope among Middle East refugees",Inside a partner&rsquo;s mission to go beyond the numbers and shed a light on the human side of the ongoing refugee crisis,2021-07-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/stephen%20hall/stephenhall-hero-small-classroom-1536x864-bright.jpg,"Social Impact,Our People,Middle East",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinseys-work-to-support-the-refugee-crisis,"Through education and cricket, building hope among Middle East refugees Students in a classroom at the Sawiri school in Lebanon. The school is one of the many organizations McKinsey has partnered with to support refugee children's education. July 29, 2021 “What were you doing 10 years ago?” This is a question Stephen Hall , a partner in McKinsey’s Dubai office, often asks when he’s trying to help people understand what the statistics don’t capture about the Syrian refugee crisis, which began in March 2011. The numbers, after all, are a matter of empirical record—and staggering: There are more than 5.5 million refugees in the region, and 6.1 million others are internally displaced, according to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. As many as 1.5 million of those refugees are in Lebanon. “Once you recall what you were doing, think about everything that’s happened in your life since,” Stephen says. “Now imagine that for that entire time, you’ve been displaced, living in a camp, and unable to return to your home country. This is the heartbreaking reality that millions of refugees live with everyday.” Helping create positive, enduring change in the Middle East Stephen has seen that reality up close as one of the leaders of McKinsey’s pro-bono work to support the ongoing refugee crisis, which is featured in our regional social responsibility report Giving Back in 2020 . In his five years at the firm, he’s worked with several NGOs in Lebanon and across the region on their response to the crisis. This has included a lot of work on education—with almost 500,000 children among the refugee population, continued learning is one of the most challenging aspects of the crisis. “One of the reasons we chose to focus on education is the fact that many children have been out of school for years, and others haven’t been to school at all, so this isn’t just a short-term disruption,” Stephen says. “At the same time, the challenges that schools and teachers face in a refugee context are the same as those schools and teachers face everywhere—getting more students access to learning. And it’s exciting to be able to bring solutions we’ve developed in other places to these challenges.” During the pandemic, which put an increased strain on education access, McKinsey colleagues teamed up with the Alsama Project , which seeks to empower refugee women and children. In addition to establishing partnerships with English-language schools to create distance-learning opportunities for refugee children, we helped develop a toolkit for refugee schools in Lebanon. In close collaboration with NGOs like Alsama and the Sawiri school, in both Beirut and the Bekaa Valley, we have developed a program to improve the classroom experience and education outcomes in refugee camps, from curriculum development, to teacher training, and broader school governance . Our team has also helped to set up a mentoring program, with consultants from across the Middle East volunteering their time to work with students from different schools to think about their education and how to set goals for their future, however challenging. Part of the focus on student wellbeing extends beyond the classroom. As part of our firm’s work at the Shatila refugee camp in southern Beirut, a group of colleagues from London and the Middle East introduced a weeklong cricket camp for children. More than 40 Syrian children—most of whom had never heard of, let alone played, cricket—arrived on the first day of camp. As it turned out, news travels fast in Shatila, and on the following day, 120 kids showed up, a quarter of them girls. This project has gone from strength to strength, and Alsama now runs six sites across Lebanon, with regular competitive matches between mixed teams of boys and girls. More broadly, our support for talented youth also extends to those who have become refugees as a result of events in region over the last few decades. Through our support to the International Refugee Committee and other refugee organizations, we have helped accelerate delivery of programs—including emergency response, basic needs, and sustainability—to hundreds of thousands of refugees across the hardest hit populations of the Middle East and globally. I think anyone who sees the magnitude of this crisis wants to help...I feel incredibly lucky to be in a place and position to do so. Stephen has been based in the Middle East for 15 years, but his interest in the region runs even longer. He studied Arabic in high school (and is fluent today) and later majored in mathematics and Middle Eastern studies at university. All of this makes his work in the region even more meaningful. “I think anyone who sees the magnitude of this crisis wants to help—sometimes, they just don’t know how or don’t have the access to do so,” he says. “So I feel incredibly lucky to be in a place and position to do so.” related Delivering on our purpose during an extraordinary year In Abu Dhabi, the next generation is learning that good leadership blends head and heart Never miss a story"
"Flying across the sea, propelled by AI","To help Emirates Team New Zealand successfully defend their America&rsquo;s Cup title, we introduced them to a new sailor: a McKinsey-built AI bot.",2021-03-17T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/how%20we%20help%20clients/impact%20stories/flying%20across%20the%20sea%20propelled%20by%20ai/americascup-hero-small-boat-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/flying-across-the-sea-propelled-by-ai,"Flying across the sea, propelled by AI The America’s Cup, the oldest trophy in international sport, is competitive sailing’s most coveted prize. When the 36th edition began in early March, the race’s defending champion, Emirates Team New Zealand, hit the water having utilized a new crewmember: an AI bot created by McKinsey. It turned out to be a winning combination. On March 17, the Kiwis successfully defended their title against the Italian challengers, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, winning their fourth America’s Cup. The America’s Cup has always been as much about technology and innovation as it is about sailing. Boat designs are governed by the competition’s “ Class Rule , ” which leaves small opportunities for design tweaks that might give one team an advantage over another. If brilliantly seized, those opportunities can translate into a shining race-day performance. Our goal was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. The Class Rule for this year’s race, published in March 2018, required the two competing teams to sail a 75-foot vessel. It’s not your typical sailboat. Hydrofoils fixed to the hull lift the entire craft out of the water, enabling it to reach speeds exceeding 60 mph, or 100 kph. Most importantly, the hydrofoils are one part of the boat where the Class Rule allowed for design modifications, which offered huge competitive advantages for the teams that got those modifications right. Doing so, according to McKinsey senior partner Brian Fox, required intensive testing—and lots of it. “Every boat in the America’s Cup is designed with a computer simulator,” says Brian, who sails competitively. “Whichever team has the best simulator, and uses it most effectively, gains the advantage.” In 2019, Emirates Team New Zealand partnered with McKinsey to begin an innovative project seeking that advantage. What they needed, they soon realized, was a new kind of crew member that could sail thousands of boats at a time. The answer to that call was an AI bot, or software robot, that could test new hydrofoil designs by sailing them on Emirates Team New Zealand’s simulator. Creating value beyond the hype The simulator had been key to the team’s victory in 2017; the sailors had used it to test new boat designs without having to actually build them. But that simulator required multiple team members using it simultaneously for it to work properly. This was a logistical challenge, given the sailors’ scheduled practices, travel, and competitions. “Our goal,” Brian explains, “was to speed up testing of Emirates Team New Zealand’s designs. By developing an AI bot that could run the simulator by itself, we no longer had to manage around the sailors’ limited availability.” As a first step, the McKinsey team, which included colleagues from our analytics firm QuantumBlack , turned to the cloud. Over six-weeks, data, analytics, and machine-learning experts from Sydney, Melbourne, and London migrated New Zealand’s simulator and developed an infrastructure to run it in the cloud. Then our team used a new and innovative approach called deep reinforcement learning to essentially teach the AI bot how to become a professional sailor. The technique allowed the bot to learn dynamically and gain greater accuracy through continuous feedback. Nic Hohn , one of the key project leaders, explains. “When you start, the AI agent knows nothing and learns by trial and error using countless variables—wind speed, direction, adjustments to the 14 different sail and boat controls—and is refined again and again,” Nic says. “Since the bot keeps experimenting, if you coach it to learn in the right way, it compresses into hours what would take a human years to understand.” This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat. The work was highly technical, according to QuantumBlack’s chief scientist Jacomo Corbo, and it required  extensive innovation around the bot’s learning program. “At this point in the project, a lot of creative thinking had to be done to figure out the right learning models, how best to coach the bot, and the right guard rails and rewards to put into place.” The team also created a network that allowed multiple bots to share information as they each learned to sail. This was a critical breakthrough, as it allowed the individual bots to gain knowledge from their collective experience. Ultimately, there were a thousand bots running in parallel, learning from each other. “It's learning at a huge scale and it dramatically reduces the time and cost of the project,” says Nic. “That's the power of the cloud.” Within two weeks, the bot was sailing in a straight line, upwind and downwind. After mastering the basics, it graduated to more complex sailing maneuvers. The turning point came about eight weeks later, when the AI bot started beating the sailors in the simulator. At this point, the bot became the ideal way to test variations of the hydrofoils; it was more consistent and more scalable than the sailors, speeding the cycles of design iterations dramatically. “This was the critical unlock—the ability to take the sailors’ schedules out of the equation and test designs 24/7 on rapid repeat,” observes Helen Mayhew , a McKinsey partner and member of the QuantumBlack leadership team in Europe, who is also a world champion sailor. Soon, the sailors were learning maneuvers from the bot. “With such a steep development curve, accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable,” explains Oliver Fleming , an expert associate partner, “both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, the bot sped New Zealand’s design process by a factor of ten. The race’s outcome proves that reinforcement learning can be a transformational tool for process design, with potential applications across industries. “This has been one of the most complex deployments of deep reinforcement learning in the public cloud,” says Jacomo. “One way to think about the difficulty of the problem: game-tree complexity roughly tallies the size of the space one has to navigate while accounting for the set of possible game paths, or the sequence of decisions, that need to be taken. Go , which is an extremely complex board game, has a game-tree complexity of 170—our sailing problem has a game-tree complexity of nearly 2900.” Mastering such technical complexity, particularly in this application, has heightened this project’s excitement for everyone involved. “It is thrilling to be using technology and AI to master the wind and water and go as fast as you possibly can,” says Nic. “This is not sailing as we know it—it's much closer to flying a low-altitude aircraft.” To learn more about our work in AI, visit QuantumBlack .

It’s part of the Navy’s ongoing mission to be a learning organization, one that applies lessons from the past and insights from today’s world to develop leadership and resilience. Its motto? Read well to lead well. This year, No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Forces Breaking all the Trends , published in 2015 by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) directors James Manyika and Jonathan Woetzel , and alum Richard Dobbs, was named to the list of 53 books . It is one of four books in the list’s Capabilities Capstone section. “It was an absolutely unexpected, very pleasant surprise to be part of this 200-year history,” says James, “and very flattering particularly given some of the other books.” No Ordinary Disruption explores the overriding effect on the world of newly emerging markets, an aging population, the relentless rate of technology innovation, and ever-changing flows of trade, capital, and people. The book offers thoughtful data analyses and arresting facts to convince readers that their assumptions about the way forward, in both business and everyday life, may need to be reset. Written in a pre-COVID world, the book’s four trends and their impacts still resonate, according to James. “If we have any lessons it is that these massive disruptions have an impact that is far more multifaceted than we anticipated at the time, playing out in labor markets, the economy, competition and value creation, social inequality, geopolitics, and our everyday lives,” he observes. “If anything, we underestimated the impact of the 12+ technology disruptions that we highlighted in the book; a positive example would be the bio revolution , which proved to be incredibly valuable in the COVID era, accelerating the development of the vaccines.” We still know what you’re reading this summer The evolution of global flows has also had an outsize influence on economies and companies. As digitization became commonplace, leaders in both the public and private sectors around the world strategized to develop greater resilience and flex in their newly digitized value chains so they could secure and deliver essential medicines, equipment, food, and basic consumer goods. “If one trend has perhaps receded in conversation while continuing unabated,” says James, “it is the aging in most advanced economies' populations."" No Ordinary Disruption is an enduring McKinsey on Books work on strategy. If the authors were writing the book today, what disruptive forces would it highlight? “Climate change and the corrosive effects of economic and social inequality,” says Jonathan Woetzel. “Both issues were threaded through our research on No Ordinary Disruption.

"Building inclusion at scale, one nudge at a time",The leaders of a new McKinsey program using behavioral science to drive organization-wide change share what they’ve learned and what’s next.,2021-08-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/building%20inclusion%20at%20scale%20one%20nudge%20at%20a%20time/nudges-hero-small-1211368784-1536x864-new2.jpg,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/building-inclusion-at-scale-one-nudge-at-a-time,"Building inclusion at scale, one nudge at a time Global Leader of Strategic & Change Communications Practice, focused on building team capabilities and delivering holistic client impact Shapes McKinsey's global programs, processes, and analytics to create and maintain a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization. August 23, 2021 How do you activate allies and build a more inclusive organization? It’s a tough question. The most well-intentioned colleagues may not know which day-to-day behaviors can make a real difference, and even those who do may forget to act in inclusive ways when it really matters. A couple of years ago, we decided to tackle this head on at McKinsey. We designed a program to help prompt individual behavioral change on a large scale. We started by defining a set of inclusive micro-habits, or small recurring behaviors, that our colleagues could easily demonstrate without having to learn new skills. To do this, we reviewed literature on inclusion and belonging, including a study authored by Amy Edmondson, Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management at Harvard Business School. We also drew on tactical insights from organizational behavior and neuroscience research, such as Tiny Habits by Stanford Behavior Design Lab founder BJ Fogg. And to make sure the behaviors resonated in our specific environment, we crowd-sourced suggestions and ideas from our own colleagues. Diversity wins: How inclusion matters The effort yielded a list of tangible micro-habits that we put to work through a new opt-in program called Inclusion Nudges. Built on insights from the groundbreaking research of Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, who have just published their latest insights on the tactic in Nudge: The Final Edition , our nudges are short, timely, insightful prompts that combine serious research with memorable stories or visuals that activate inclusive behaviors and make them stick. For example, in a nudge called, “Be somebody’s best advocate,” we encouraged colleagues to amplify the work, ideas, and leadership of others, even if (or especially when) they’re not present. It featured the image of an airplane flying a banner celebrating a colleague’s good work. Elsewhere, in a nudge called “Giving credit where credit is due,” we shared the story of Ada Lovelace and other women in STEM whose contributions had been overlooked to memorably illustrate the cost of non-inclusive culture. What we’ve learned We’re conscious that we’re not alone in this effort to use nudging to drive organizational culture change, and we’re eager to share what we’ve learned so far. To those looking to launch a similar program, we recommend focusing on three pillars: Select behaviors to nudge that are: Craft messaging that is: Build an audience by: A program built on those three pillars will provide your team with opportunities to be strategic, innovate, and improve the program over time. Most recently, we’ve used these pillars to inform our approach to a new app created in partnership with McKinsey’s Inspire Individuals team, which specializes in enabling individuals to deliver organizational change at scale through the latest in advanced analytics, digital technology, and behavioral science. The nudges app helps us achieve mass personalization at scale by offering a long tail of learning in “bite-sized” engagement (just a few minutes per week) in addition to the nudges sent by email. The app also allows us to sync with users’ Outlook calendars to enhance the relevance and timeliness of reminders to practice inclusive behaviors. Much anew about ‘nudging’ Progress and what’s next While we know there’s no single answer to building more inclusive spaces at work and beyond, the feedback we’ve received so far on the Inclusion Nudges program has been overwhelmingly positive. In a recent participant survey, about 80 percent of respondents said the nudges have directly helped them act in more inclusive ways. These numbers are supported by what we hear from our colleagues in our day to day work. One firm leader recently told us the nudges were a highlight of her day: “I love them—LOVE THEM—because they are focused, bite sized, and digestible. I sent them to my team, and incorporate them into my life.” We know from our research and own experience that the gains diversity promises are only achieved in tandem with an inclusive environment. Nudging our colleagues to turn good intentions into inclusive actions is a powerful step toward culture change that matters. The team would like to thank Stefan Sierra, Jacqueline Brassey, Catherine Loerke, and Michael Tappel, as well as the McKinsey Inspire Individuals Team for their collaboration on this work.

Are flying cars finally ready to take off?,Two partners talk about the latest in air mobility and explain how we&rsquo;re helping clients begin to make science fiction a reality.,2021-08-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/are%20flying%20cars%20finally%20ready%20to%20take%20off/flyingcars-hero-1536x864.jpg,"Innovation,Our People",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/are-flying-cars-finally-ready-to-take-off,"Are flying cars finally ready to take off? August 31, 2021 Is there a world in which your next trip to the grocery store involves a flying car? “Advanced air mobility is the next revolution in aerospace,” says Robin Riedel , a McKinsey partner and certified commercial airline pilot. “But it’s not going to be like you see in the movies.” Advanced air mobility refers to an emerging industry comprising around 250 companies that are seeking to build electric flying vehicles—think cleaner, quieter, helicopters—as well as the infrastructure to use them in cities around the world. We recently caught up with Robin and McKinsey partner Shivika Sahdev , both of whom are helping lead our work in this field, to hear more about how we’re partnering with clients on this topic, what to expect in the coming years, and whether or not a sci-fi future is on our horizon. Flying cars have always seemed to be something just over the horizon—why are we suddenly making so much progress right now? Robin: There’s been a convergence of several trends in recent years. First, on-demand services have changed the way we think about mobility. Second, there’s a focus on sustainability, which these vehicles support. Third, there’s a lot of funding available—investors who want to be a part of the next big thing. And lastly, the technology is finally there to do this at scale. Shivika: Totally agreed, but the fundamental one for me is really battery technology. We are finally reaching the density and affordability of batteries where the physics and economics of powering one of these vehicles starts making sense. Talk to us about the sustainability aspect involved. Shivika: Transportation is a huge part of our carbon footprint. Unless we do something about the entire transport network, we’re not going to solve climate change. So there’s a lot of enthusiasm around electrifying the way we move around. These vehicles are a lot more sustainable an option than, for example, the helicopters they could replace. Robin: The sustainability piece isn’t that these are going to replace all cars, or even a significant amount of public transportation. It will almost always be more sustainable to take an electric bus or train; those modes of transport carry more people per trip. But for certain kinds of trips, advanced air mobility vehicles can really help cut down on emissions. Up in the air: How do consumers view advanced air mobility? What kinds of trips do you think will be common before the end of this decade? Robin: There will likely be use cases within cities: flying from downtown London to Heathrow airport, or from Manhattan to J.F.K. But it might be harder to replace taxis or other public transport to go a handful of blocks uptown or downtown. Not soon, at least. Shivika: Regional trips might be another one, going from one city to the next. A business traveler going from New York City to Washington, D.C. could pay a premium for taking one of these vehicles instead of the train or a plane. A lot depends on the purpose of the trip. Robin: Initially, it will be a relatively expensive way to get around. Think about a helicopter service; it might make sense for a business traveler who needs to get somewhere quickly. But for the average consumer, it won’t. Accessibility is an important aspect of this to solve. It can’t just be for business travelers going to the airport. Describe what the passenger experience will look like. Robin: Somewhere in between today’s ride-hailing and airline travel. For some operators, customers will have the aircraft to themselves while for others, they might share the ride with others. The vehicles will be relatively small compared to today’s airlines with one to seven passenger seats, depending on the manufacturer. The inside will feel similar to cars—think comfortable seats and seat belts, climate conditioning, and windows to observe the scenery. Most operators plan to have pilots operate the aircraft in the initial years. Given the relatively short flights, the aircraft won’t have galleys, flight attendants or washrooms. To board the aircraft, travelers will use dedicated vertiports, which may be on top of higher buildings and require an elevator to get to or ground level like a large parking lot. What are some challenges that stand between the present and widespread use? Shivika: Infrastructure is a big one. The initial use cases will have to take advantage of existing infrastructure, such as helipads and airports—that’s why airport transfers will likely be one of the first real use cases. You also need electrical infrastructure, as these machines will need a lot of energy at really high power levels. Obviously, that electricity will need to come from renewable sources if this is going to be sustainable. Robin: There are still a lot of challenges to overcome. A ton of skilled labor will ultimately be required to bring this vision to life.  But the two biggest challenges in my mind are public acceptance and getting the right regulatory systems in place. And those two things are related. Can you elaborate on that connection? Robin: Advanced air mobility is a lot cleaner and quieter than helicopters, but they still make noise. People worry about that. They also worry, of course, about safety. Accidents might be much rarer than with automobiles, but they will garner more attention. Getting the right public inputs, and the right regulation in place, will help ensure that the technology has public confidence and buy-in. Shivika: I see four big buckets of things regulators can consider. The primary one is safety. Then, on the technical side, regulators need to physically certify the aircraft itself. Examine every part, test them under different scenarios, and so on. Next is training for pilots—there will need to be certification there. And finally, there’s general operations; air travel has well-defined procedures for communications, connectivity, takeoff and landing, and setting routes. There will need to be some version of that for these vehicles. I also just want to emphasize the community piece, as Robin mentioned. Regulators will need to make sure communities are involved in the decision-making and have their perspectives considered. How are we working with clients on all of these issues? Robin: We serve in a number of related spaces: aerospace and automotive incumbents, regulators, infrastructure players, startups, investors, supply chain, and more. One big area is helping clients better understand the market size, market evolution, and timing. How big is the market, and how big can the market get? If it’s going to be a $500 billion market, by when? A lot of people want to know and adjust their business strategies accordingly. We’re working together with clients to design their organizations for growth, building digital platforms to manage aerial mobility, and setting up a complex supply chain and manufacturing process. Shivika: Along with that, you want to understand the different opportunities along the value chain and in the associated business models. Essentially, if this is going to be a big market, where should stakeholders be looking to add value? Robin: A final thing I want to mention is that we’re looking at this emerging field through a lens we call “holistic impact,” which is how McKinsey defines and measures the broader impact of our work across stakeholder groups. We’re asking ourselves, how are we not only finding value but also improving things for employees, communities, and the environment? Most optimistically, where do you see advanced air mobility 10 years from now? Is there any sci-fi potential here, or is it going to be small steps for the time being? Shivika: In 10 years, my most optimistic guess is that you’ll have hundreds of these flying in a given big city. But I don’t think it’s going to be a reasonable alternative to buses, cars, or rail in that time period. For regional travel and airport transfers, though, definitely. Robin: Agreed. Boston to New York, Berlin to Hamburg, or Hong Kong to Guangzhou. Similar short-haul regional travel in other countries around the world—situations where you could save three or four hours—advanced air mobility might be a considered option. Again, I do think it will be primarily for business travelers and high-net-worth individuals in the beginning. But we hope to eventually help clients figure out how to scale to serve a much broader customer base. related Where the auto industry of today imagines the rides of tomorrow Up in the air: How do consumers view advanced air mobility?

Now an associate partner, JP co-leads our Institute for Black Economic Mobility and led the research for The economic state of Black America: What it is and what it could be . In 1998, he and his Trinidadian American family of six moved from a low-income town in New Jersey to nearby Bloomfield. The 15 miles in between made a world of difference to his life. Twenty percent of his first town’s residents lived below the poverty line at the time. The grocery store was a 20-minute drive away, and there were few nearby parks or playgrounds. “My mom took two buses to commute to work in New York City every day — sometimes 90 minutes one way,” he recalls. Several years later, the family moved to Bloomfield, NJ, about a 20-minute drive away on the Garden State Parkway. “I remember the first day we moved in,” he says. “We had our own backyard, a bank on the corner, a diner a block away. My mom’s commuter train stop was a five-minute walk. My parents let me ride my bike throughout the neighborhood.” “In third grade,” he adds, “I realized for the first time how important place was in shaping opportunity and your life. And so this research resonated with me on a very personal level.” The Julien family in 2002. Back row, L to R: Ken (father), Brenda (mother), Brandon. Front row L to R: Kenda, Briege, Brittney, and JP. To produce the report, JP and a team of researchers and data experts at the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility and McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) conducted extensive analyses to understand and quantify the roles that Black Americans play in the economy — as workers, business owners, consumers, savers, investors, and residents. The study reveals significant economic gaps due to racial inequity and offers a vision of what could be gained if they were closed. Well over a third of 20 million Black American workers earn less than $30,000 per year, according to the report. To address this, JP and his co-authors outline a number of longer-term strategies, such as investing in critical community resources, like transit access, strengthening education and training pathways, and improving the workplace experience. “But the quickest win is to fundamentally improve job quality,” says JP. “Blacks today tend to work in lower-paying occupations in healthcare, retail and accommodation, and food service.” Improving job quality for these essential workers, JP explains, involves moves on multiple fronts. “It means culturally competent career training and skills building, pay increases, access to employee benefits, and more flexible and predictable work schedules so folks are actually building a resilient career with an income that's sustainable.” Such investment will take real conviction on the part of employers, but it would have an immediate, meaningful effect, and a number of innovative initiatives are already taking hold in both the public and private sector. “I'm excited about training programs that provide upfront funding to individuals and enable them to develop critical skills for their careers, and then once they are fully employed, they pay back the cost in increments,” says JP. The economic state of Black America: What is and what could be Another promising development is in recruitment: the idea of qualifying job candidates by their tangible skills and on-the-job experience, rather than by educational credentials and networks, which can open up positions to a much wider, more diverse pool of candidates. A number of companies have been rethinking their supply-chain spend as well: shifting dollars to support more minority-owned businesses, which can also support Black workers. “Again, this can have a relatively fast but lasting impact in helping Black entrepreneurs grow, so they can hire more workers in the communities that they support,” JP points out. But for some Black leaders, the most inspiring change is happening where boards and leadership teams are starting to think about racial equity as core to their businesses, not just as a philanthropic goal and part of corporate social responsibility programs. “Banks are now developing mortgage or lending products that actually meet the needs of Black consumers; broadband companies are creating flexible, lower-entry product offerings,” says JP. “Consumer companies are recognizing an opportunity to invest in underserved communities. They are opening locations and introducing products, brands, and services designed specifically to appeal to Black consumers and other underrepresented populations.” According to the research, Black consumers say they will pay up to 20 percent more for products tailored to their preferences. When combined with full income parity, it adds up to an opportunity of some $700 billion in potential value. Because many of the findings are so concentrated, it also makes for solutions that are much more focused, tangible, and targeted. If there were there any surprises in the research, it was how concentrated some of the findings are, according to JP.  For example, less than four percent of all occupational categories (e.g. managers, lawyers, physicians, software developers) account for more than 60 percent of the racial wage disparity. Or the fact that 60 percent of the difference in annual wealth flows between Black and White households comes from intergenerational transfers. “Because many of the findings are so concentrated,” JP points out, “it also makes for solutions that are much more focused, tangible, and targeted. And channeling these interventions and resources to the places in need can transform lives — as my own experience has shown.” related Why sponsorship is key to helping Black employees advance—and more takeaways from our new research Never miss a story"
Can data science turn ocean conservation dreams into reality?,"Through a series of pro-bono projects, McKinsey is supporting the Blue Nature Alliance by developing innovative funding models for marine conservation.",2021-09-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/helping%20blue%20nature%20alliance%20protect%20ocean%20life/bna-hero-fullcolumn-1213747857-1536x864.jpg,"Sustainability,AI & Analytics,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/helping-blue-nature-alliance-protect-ocean-life,"Can data science turn ocean conservation dreams into reality? September 23, 2021 Several of the world’s largest environmental funders and nonprofits are stepping up their efforts to protect more of the Earth’s oceanic surface area. Launched in April 2021, the Blue Nature Alliance is a global partnership founded by Conservation International, The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Global Environment Facility, Minderoo Foundation, and the Rob & Melani Walton Foundation. By engaging local stewards and advocates on ocean conservation, the Blue Nature Alliance aims to use marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective conservation measures to shield parts of the ocean against the harmful effects of climate change, damaging fishing practices, and habitat degradation. The Blue Nature Alliance has set an ambitious target of protecting five percent of the world’s ocean, a massive undertaking considering that the ocean covers 71 percent of the planet. These efforts are part of a larger global movement inspired by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity to protect more of the world’s surface area from environmental threats and to keep the ecosystems humans depend on intact. Known as the 30x30 commitment, the pledge calls on leaders from nations across the world to commit to protecting 30 percent of land and 30 percent of the ocean under their governance by 2030. Through a series of pro-bono projects, McKinsey is supporting the alliance by developing innovative funding models for marine conservation. Utilizing advanced, multi-dimensional analyses that account for socioeconomic considerations (such as job creation and economic growth for a region undertaking the protection of a specific area) McKinsey experts are supporting the establishment and management of six new large-scale MPAs. As a result, the Blue Nature Alliance will be able to pioneer new ways to finance these vital conservation efforts. One innovation being explored is the potential to monetize the ‘spillover’ of restored fish stocks from so-called no-take zones, where no extractive activity is allowed, into adjacent sustainable fishing zones that boost local economies. “This work is powerful for two reasons,” says Duko Hopman , a McKinsey associate partner focused on conservation. “First, it plays a critical role in sustaining biodiversity, which is vital to our planet. And second, it has the potential to create massive socioeconomic opportunities for people around the world who live along ocean coastlines.” According to The Pew Charitable Trusts , “well-managed MPAs remain the best tool to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems, improve long-term food security, and protect ocean-based livelihoods.” Today, McKinsey’s expertise in financing instruments coupled with our analysis of geospatial datasets has helped to refine the MPA approach. This is done by pinpointing specific regions positioned to realize the greatest combined economic and biodiversity conservation benefits for nature and local stewards, such as Indigenous peoples and coastal communities. “The Blue Nature Alliance provides both technical assistance and direct investment in governance, protected area design, management, planning and implementation, and innovative financing design based on a shared goal and work plan co-created with local partners,” said Christopher Stone, conservation finance lead, Blue Nature Alliance. “With the help of McKinsey’s unique capabilities in data science and the development of financing models, the Blue Nature Alliance can make the case for an expansion of ocean protection and support effective management and sustainable finance resulting in the best outcomes for nature and people.” McKinsey’s initial work with the Blue Nature Alliance resulted in three potential financing models to help create or support large-scale marine protected areas. This year, the work is focused on helping the alliance apply those financing models to specific marine sites in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These analytics are directly supporting efforts to protect 581,000 square kilometers of net-new marine conservation. In addition, McKinsey is supporting the Blue Nature Alliance to develop methodologies that enable local leaders and decision-makers to begin taking clear, concrete steps toward establishing financially sustainable MPAs. McKinsey is providing a fact-base data science approach to help decision-makers assess the conservation trade-offs of creating large-scale MPAs. These trade-offs could be calculating the short-term loss of income from fishing in conjunction with the benefits of creating new conservation jobs and the economic gains from recovered fish stocks. The current phase of work is directly supporting efforts to protect 581,000 square kilometers of net new marine conservation across the South Pacific Ocean, which would result in the protection of potentially 270 threatened species and the creation of approximately 3,400 jobs. By establishing a global network of partners and through innovative models of conservation and funding, the Blue Nature Alliance is driving rapid progress towards its target to permanently protect five percent of the ocean—a globally significant contribution to addressing the twin climate and biodiversity crises. related Protecting the ocean: Young innovators share big ideas Never miss a story"

Today we release the 2021 report—the first to include an entire year’s worth of findings during the pandemic. Now that we’ve had a year to examine just exactly how women in the workplace have been doing through a time like no other, we explore our most burning questions below with Jess Huang , a McKinsey partner and co-leader of the research. Have more women left corporate jobs? Not exactly, Jess explains, but not much progress has been made either. Women—especially those who manage teams—are more burned out than men. “While women have made small gains at almost every level of the pipeline, including the C-suite,” Jess explains, “women of color continue to be dramatically underrepresented at high levels. And because of the persistent broken rung at the first step up to manager, there are just not enough women in middle management to promote to senior leadership.” When it comes to jobs of the future—like engineering and product management—that call for technical skills, the representation of women lags at every level. Only 34 percent of the entry-level roles in engineering and product management were women in 2020, compared to 48 percent in our study’s overall benchmark. Are companies at risk? They may be. The good news is that women are stepping up to support employee well-being and advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their companies. The bad news is that companies are not recognizing it. Throughout the pandemic, Jess explains, women senior leaders have done 60 percent more to provide emotional support to employees than their male counterparts. “This focus on supporting employees and colleagues is the leadership that companies have so badly needed during these last two years of added pressure and strain,” says Jess. While 87 percent of companies say it’s critical for managers to support employee well-being, only 25 percent of them formally recognize this work. Perhaps this is the result of DEI work so often being relegated to “new office housework,” as Jess puts it—“the kind of work that contributes to the business but isn’t formally recognized in performance reviews nor leads to advancement or compensation.” You won’t have sustainable inclusive growth if you’re not rewarding the type of work that drives that outcome. Where can progress be made? A recurring theme from the report is a disconnect between intention and action. For example, despite an increase in the number of white employees who say they are allies of women of color (77 percent), only 20 percent regularly advocate for opportunities for them. And although over 90 percent of companies made commitments to focus on racial equity, only 40 percent of employees think companies have followed through. To help bridge this gap between companies and employees, Jess explains, leaders can be held accountable by tracking diversity metrics and tying outcomes to performance reviews and financial incentives. Additionally, programs to combat bias in performance reviews and hiring can be implemented to address the broken rung. And when it comes to offering support to employees, having policies and resources in place like on-site childcare, parental leave, and mental health services can have a meaningful impact. Women in the Workplace 2021 Many leading companies have made great headway in acting on these measures already, says Jess, but more needs to be done at an individual level. “You won’t have sustainable inclusive growth if you’re not rewarding the type of work that drives that outcome,” she adds. “What gets measured, rewarded, and recognized is what ultimately gets done.” related How are working women doing during COVID-19?

Here are quick looks at some of the year’s best business reading: The Aristocracy of Talent: How Meritocracy Made the Modern World Adrian Wooldridge Meritocracy—the idea of people advancing based on their talents rather than social standing—should get another look.  In this book, Woolridge traces the history of meritocracy and how it has transformed social mobility for women. The book proposes that meritocracy is a catalyst that could help rebalance the social, economic and racial inequality of today's world. The Conversation: How Talking Honestly About Racism Can Transform Individuals and Organizations Robert Livingston Livingston has helped corporations, police departments, hospitals, universities, and  government agencies address racism within their organizations. In his first book—a powerful combination of storytelling, social research, and a pragmatic five-step process—he helps readers develop fact-based perspectives that can lead to insight and increased empathy. Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty Patrick Radden Keefe This book, according to the FT, “explores the links between the Sackler family and the global epidemic of opioid addiction through the rise and fall of Purdue Pharma, a company owned by two of the Sackler brothers and their families.” 1 We still know what you’re reading this summer The New Climate War Michael E. Mann Climate change denialists are turning into “inactivists,” saying it’s up to individuals to reduce carbon emissions with the right diets, cars, and habits. While personal responsibility can help, Mann, a climate scientist, spotlights the real issue: the urgent need for unequivocal macro-strategies to de-carbonize our economies. This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race Nicole Perlroth Stolen elections. Poisoned water. Nuclear meltdowns.

Supporting the arts: A portrait of our work in the culture sector,"McKinsey colleagues with a passion for, and experience in, the arts are expanding our work in the culture sector and serving clients in new ways.",2021-10-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20behind%20the%20scenes%20look%20at%20our%20culture%20sector%20work/culturesector-hero-fullcol-1269050755-1536x864.jpg,"Digital,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-our-culture-sector-work,"Supporting the arts: A portrait of our work in the culture sector October 12, 2021 When Kristin Van Ausdal joined a McKinsey team to help an acclaimed orchestra develop a digital strategy, she brought a unique perspective to the table: she had performed as the first violinist with The Cleveland Orchestra, one of the “big five” in the U.S. When a national museum needed leadership development, Lulu Chang , a concert pianist, stepped in to help. When cultural institutions are looking to digitize, Loic Tallon , former chief digital officer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, can offer critical expertise. Kristin, Lulu, and Loic are part of growing number of McKinsey colleagues who are combining a passion for the arts with digital, strategic, and organizational skills to take our impact in the cultural sector—which we have been serving for over six decades—to a new level. “Cultural institutions, from museums to science centers and the performing arts, play a crucial role in making a more creative, equitable, and empathetic society,” explains Ian Jefferson , a senior partner based in Washington D.C. “They employ some 29 million people around the world. Our work in this sector speaks directly to our purpose of creating positive, enduring change.” Joshua Hsu helped lead the team’s work with the orchestra. “What we can offer institutions is a tremendous depth of expertise. In this case, we tapped into a community of 50+ McKinsey and external experts in virtual reality, mobile apps, video-on-demand and streaming platforms to help develop a digital transformation.” The team worked with Leap by McKinsey colleagues, who specialize in helping organizations build and scale innovative new businesses and ways of doing business. They mapped out 10 digital journeys across the orchestra’s internal and external stakeholders, including performers—where Kristin’s expertise as a professional musician proved invaluable. They also conducted workshops to identify and develop six big digital initiatives to engage audiences that aim to transform the organization over the coming decades. “This is just the beginning of our partnership,” says Joshua. In another project, Lulu, a classical pianist and McKinsey associate, worked with her team to help a national art museum create an operating model and develop leadership capabilities to support their new management. “We designed a series of workshops focused on team effectiveness, new ways of working, and leadership,” explains Lulu. According to one museum participant, the experience was essential. “If we hadn’t spent time building team trust, we’d never be able to execute on our ambitious strategy.” The museum team has been enthusiastic about implementing changes, and in turn, have been teaching McKinsey colleagues about their art collections. Elsewhere, we have worked to assess the impact of COVID-19 on cultural institutions, which have been devastated by the pandemic. Many had already been struggling, as donorship has dropped and new technologies and forms of entertainment offer compelling alternatives. An estimated one third of museums may permanently close their doors in the US, for example, unless they receive financial help. “The cultural sector is at an existential moment,” says Ian, “When organizations have an acute, important problem, there can also be an amazing opportunity to change their trajectory. This is often when we can help clients.” Cultural institutions can face the same challenges as the private sector: How do you reinvent yourself using technology? Mobilize your leadership? Stand up a new branch, while remaining open to the public? In the past five years, our work in the cultural sector has broadened from serving local institutions to working with 100+ organizations around the world. “We want to be a long-time partner to the sector, use our global network of experts, and codify our assets so they can be shared, repeatable, and dramatically increase our impact for clients,” explains Loic. The team has been innovating our service model: co-investing with government and philanthropic organizations on large-scale programs; developing cohort-based client projects; and creating new assets, such as a tool that assesses the socioeconomic benefits a cultural institution creates for its communities. Our cultural institutions, from museums to science centers and the performing arts, play a crucial role in making a more creative, equitable, and empathetic society. Diversity is another critical challenge. “As public-facing organizations often funded by government, cultural institutions have a larger duty to represent the diversity in our society,” explains Cassiope Sydoriak , an associate and former art historian leading diversity development within the sector. “For many, this means rethinking their recruiting and hiring, the programs they create, and the communities they serve.” To date, employees from over 50 cultural institutions have attended the McKinsey Black Leadership Academy. “One reason I’m passionate about this work is that it has revealed how many of our colleagues are directly connected to the cultural sector: dancers, musicians, comedians, writers, acrobats, artists,” Loic says. “It has inspired a groundswell of passion: colleagues who want to step up and support a sector that is too often over-looked, but which they believe is critical to the health of society.” In the culture sector, we serve governments and ministers of culture, NGOs, foundations and philanthropists, arts related businesses, and cultural institutions.

What will it take to green seven of the hardest-to-abate industries?,"Working with the Mission Possible Partnership, McKinsey is helping to reduce carbon emissions in shipping, aviation, steel, and other areas.",2021-10-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/making%20the%20impossible%20possible/missionpossible-hero-small-83994439-1536x864.jpg,"Sustainability,Innovation",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/making-the-impossible-possible-mpp-takes-on-greening-seven-of-the-hardest-to-abate-sectors,"What will it take to green seven of the hardest-to-abate industries? October 14, 2021 The Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is addressing one of the toughest challenges in climate change: decarbonizing seven of the world’s hardest-to-abate sectors by 2050. McKinsey is serving as a lead partner of the coalition, bringing over a decade of sustainability research, analytics tools and solutions, and a dedicated team of more than 30 partners and experts. The global coalition includes institutions such as the World Economic Forum, Energy Transition Commission, RMI, and the We Mean Business Coalition, along with companies across heavy-duty road transport, aviation, shipping, steel, aluminum, cement, and chemicals. Together, these sectors currently produce 30 percent of the world’s carbon emissions. “This is one of the most significant collaborations within our sustainability agenda,” says Thomas Hundertmark , a McKinsey senior partner and a leader in our Sustainability Practice . “We are bringing the best of the firm—our knowledge, technologies, and our talent—to work against the clock to help four industries—shipping, aviation, steel and trucking—develop and achieve their net-zero pathways.” Destination net zero Net zero refers to the difference between the amount of greenhouse gas we produce in the atmosphere during a set period of time and the amount that is removed from the atmosphere. We reach net zero when the two amounts are equal.  A net zero pathway will limit the global temperature increase in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, as set by the Paris Accords; ideally we will be also working to limit it to 1.5 degrees where possible. In energy-intensive industries, pursuing a net-zero pathway means transforming the sector, investing in new “green” technologies while proactively phasing out legacy carbon-intensive assets. It means addressing how this transformation affects companies, their stakeholders, and communities, from investing in and standing up new technologies, reskilling and developing new talent, to setting up infrastructure, materials, and resources. To lead such massive change, the MPP will be collaborating with key participants in supply, demand, finance, and government to set targets, create industry transition strategies in five-year increments, shape policy and incentives, establish cooperative R&D, and finalize metrics and assessments. “These sectors form the foundation of our world,” says Faustine Delasalle, co-executive director at the MPP. “To support their transformation means building them a pathway towards net zero. We are accelerating this by bringing the entire value chain together and enabling radical collaboration. The on-the-ground industry experience of McKinsey is extremely valuable, and we’re looking forward to working together in the next critical decade.” Dee Yang, a McKinsey associate partner who is leading our collaboration with the MPP, says that the work will “accelerate transitions in the broad ecosystem through open-source roadmaps and frameworks, across-the-board collaboration, and creating a clear path to operationalize strategies into day-to-day processes.” A number of joint McKinsey and partner initiatives are already underway. In shipping, our team is developing a plan for ‘green shipping corridors’ by identifying optimal cargo routes based on volume and feasibility, analyzing the most viable types of green fuel, and outlining infrastructure requirements, such as fuel availability in a port. These sectors form the foundation of our world. To support their transformation means building them a pathway towards net zero. The construction industry is the largest consumer of steel for commercial buildings and infrastructure projects, such as bridges and ports. A key roadblock to getting construction firms to switch to green steel has been the complexity of the suppliers’ ecosystem and varying degrees of technology maturity. Our experts have been working to rationalize the complicated landscape into a coherent set of buying choices, while identifying the levers that can best encourage sales. Finally, in aviation, we are developing a transition strategy that considers new technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuels and novel propulsion systems, and in long-haul trucking, we are exploring strategies for the significant scale up of electric or hydrogen alternatives. “Every industrial client today needs to understand the latest developments of decarbonization at work in their sector,” says Thomas. “It will be the most significant factor in their business in over the next decade. The fact that we are a leading partner in the coalition that is setting the bar means we can provide invaluable help for their own journeys.” related Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero Can data science turn ocean conservation dreams into reality?

In the short video below, Jop Weterings , our director of environmental sustainability, shares his reflections on the day and his perspective on the critical role collaboration will play in achieving meaningful climate action. For highlights from Jop’s interview, read on. On the potential to limit global warming I believe the world has most of the solutions required to limit warming to 1.5°C, but we need to scale them, and we need to make them more economical. The private sector will need to play a big role working together with the public sector. On McKinsey’s carbon footprint At McKinsey, we’ve committed to reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030 . To get there, we have validated science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with a 1.5-degree pathway, the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement. And for our remaining footprint, we will remove carbon from the atmosphere, for example through reforestation projects. On reducing emissions from our own operations One way we are reducing emissions is by transitioning each of our offices to 100 percent renewable electricity. We’re 95 percent of the way there, and we will reach 100 percent by 2025. We're also working to make our office space more sustainable and target the highest green-building certification standards, such as LEED Gold or Platinum. We're proud that 46 percent of our global office space already meets this standard, up from one-third two years ago. Our office locations with company cars are finalizing plans to decarbonize their fleets – for example, by making electric vehicles the new default for lease renewals while also introducing alternative, flexible mobility options. One office that has already made a lot of progress is our Amsterdam Office, where today, battery electric vehicles make up roughly 60 percent of our fleet and another 15 percent is hybrid. On greening our business travel While we are all keen to see each other and our clients again, we are now working towards more of a hybrid way of working – and many of our clients are doing the same. Across the globe, teams are piloting alternative working models that are not only more environmentally sustainable, but also more inclusive, productive, and result in a better experience – both for our clients and our colleagues. This could, for, example mean that we spend fewer nights away from home, lose less time while in transit, and are able to bring our best experts to more clients. On accelerating action through partnerships We’re working together with our clients and others on scaling the solutions we need to limit warming to 1.5°C, because no single organization can achieve this on their own. One example of a partnership I’m very excited about is in the area of nature conservation. Our research shows that achieving a 1.5-degree pathway would require nearly halting deforestation by the end of this decade. In fact, while forests have tremendous potential to sequester carbon, deforestation is currently among the largest drivers of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s why earlier this year we became an initial participant in the LEAF Coalition , which aims to become one of the largest ever public-private efforts to protect tropical forests. related Our latest commitment to protect the planet: Reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030 Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero Never miss a story"

October 20, 2021 Manufacturing innovations coupled with extraordinary demand are revolutionizing the industry and offering new opportunities to players in the sector. On October 15, our chief people officer and Operations practice leader Katy George joined the Washington Post ’s Jonathan Capehart for a discussion on the promise of new manufacturing technology, the potential for industry transformation, and the central role that people will play in success. Earlier in the segment, Mr. Capehart was joined by US Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh. You can watch the entire event at Washington Post Live or read on for edited highlights from Katy’s remarks. On America’s manufacturing opportunity The future of America depends on sustainable and inclusive growth, and, as Secretary Walsh said, technology is key to that. And that is about shifting from 20th century manufacturing to 21st century manufacturing. We have this really exciting window [to make this shift] because supply shortages and the lack of resilience in our supply chain has been incredibly painful and damaging. But the flip side is that it has accelerated many companies’ journeys to digitize and use automation and advanced analytics in modernizing their manufacturing and their supply chains. On the fear of automation The companies that have been on the forefront of the technology frontier have actually created more jobs. There are some types of jobs that will diminish in size, but as companies are successful in driving productivity and growth, they actually create more jobs, different types of jobs. One of the pieces of work that I think is most interesting in this space is the work that we’ve done with the World Economic Forum , where we have identified what is now about 90 different manufacturing sites or supply chains around the world that are at the forefront of adopting Industry 4.0, or Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, including automation. What’s so exciting is that all of these examples, all of them, have been really marked with a worker centricity. They are all about actually supporting the frontline workforce, upskilling them, and making their jobs easier. On manufacturing’s “people shortage” It is absolutely the biggest issue that the sector faces. When we talk to the CEOs of our [client] companies, people are their number one issue. That’s across the board but particularly in manufacturing where, frankly, some of the shortages that we’re seeing now started pre-pandemic and they’ve just gotten worse. One of the things that the manufacturing sector is trying to do is to convince American workers that manufacturing is an exciting, high-tech industry with long-term career potential. And that’s a real change in mindset from the manufacturing of yore. Building a more competitive US manufacturing sector On successful manufacturing-tech transformation Many companies are trying to introduce new technologies into their existing sites, and they’re doing so one technology at a time as opposed to really thinking through what is the business impact they’re trying to have. The problem is that that one technology alone doesn’t transform the way work is done or operational performance. The companies that we’re seeing that are most successful take a specific area, and they typically introduce 30 or 50 different technology use-cases all at the same time. It’s augmented reality paired with digital performance management; paired with using the data from that performance management system to do advanced analytics to improve yield; paired with a digital solution to connect to the demand signal and really understand the total supply chain. When you put all of those things together, which sounds daunting but can be done in a pretty pragmatic way, you get real transformation in performance, and the companies who have been successful truly are resetting benchmarks. What I think is exciting is they are resetting benchmarks on productivity and the output that they can achieve. At the same time, they are resetting benchmarks on flexibility and also on carbon emissions, energy usage, and sustainability. We are no longer seeing this tradeoff between cost and flexibility, cost and sustainability. You can have both. On inspiring manufacturing’s next-generation of workers There is kind of an old-fashioned paradigm of manufacturing being very repetitive and difficult work. And although automation will disrupt some roles, it will also create new roles that actually are much more high-tech than the roles of the past, and frankly, not as repetitive. We can automate the repetitive stuff, we can automate the dirty stuff and the dangerous stuff. And if you do that, the workforce of today in manufacturing really is operating in a high-tech environment. It’s actually a very exciting profession. related At these factories, robots are making jobs better for workers Lighthouse manufacturers illuminate path to the next normal Never miss a story"

Over the course of two weeks there, McKinsey will host a series of panel discussions across topics including net-zero strategy, green business building, sustainable investing, and more. We spoke with colleagues leading these sessions to find out which COP26 trends may help accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth around the world. Here’s what they had to say. 1. Falling green costs Robin Smale , McKinsey partner and Vivid Economics director There’s already a massive shift underway in the uptake of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydro. What I’m most excited about is the cost reduction trend in these; they just keep on falling. This can generate a very non-linear effect. While costs for new technologies are higher than legacy technologies, uptake is low. But once costs fall to parity and below, the switch accelerates rapidly. We’re also seeing this in electric vehicles and batteries. Some applications are starting to reach cost parity with internal-combustion engine vehicles. These costs may fall further, and this is exciting because it will change the economics and technologies of transportation, with powerful knock-on impacts for our climate, nature, and people around the world. 2. Decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors Jayanti Kar , McKinsey partner On the present trajectory, even if every single one of today’s climate promises is kept, the world may fall short of the net-zero target. As a firm, we will be discussing how to solve the net-zero equation, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation, shipping, and steel. We will explore how the private sector and the public sector can cover this work between them. What can each do alone, and what can they do together? On this front, McKinsey is serving as a lead partner of Mission Possible Partnership, where we’re bringing over a decade of sustainability research, analytics tools and solutions, along with a dedicated team of more than 30 partners and experts to this challenge. The right outcomes will impact companies, their stakeholders, and communities in a range of ways. I along with many others in Glasgow next week, will be looking at the financial frameworks and operating standards that get announced to help individuals, businesses, and institutions make informed choices towards lower carbon norms, while driving decisions that are practical, immediate, and achievable in a world of uncertainty. These will be essential to help leaders act boldly rather than incrementally, and work together to carry this moment for change beyond COP26. 3. Carbon valuation Chantal Beck , McKinsey partner One of the key areas of debate at COP26 will be Article 6 of the Paris Agreement , which has to do with carbon markets. Companies are actively looking at how to transition their businesses through moves including adjusting portfolios, reducing scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and building entry into new businesses. Setting the right market incentives will be important. International carbon markets play a huge role in this, and McKinsey has been deeply involved through our knowledge support of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets . A voluntary carbon-credit market allows for carbon credits to offset emissions entities can’t eliminate by other means. Now that we’ve seen increased commitment from organizations and countries on meeting net zero, the big question is how. This conference is a critical opportunity for leaders to come together and debate what’s required—through technology, financing, new business models, regulation, policy, and more. 4. Climate finance Dickon Pinner , McKinsey senior partner and McKinsey Sustainability global leader I expect we ’ ll see more countries launch or extend the ambitions of their nationally-determined contributions , or national climate plans. I also expect to see more corporates committing to net-zero targets and other science-based goals. That ’ s table stakes. But I think a big part of success may hinge on what happens around climate finance. Mark Carney, the UN special envoy on climate action and finance, recently published a set of recommendations for investors on tracking their portfolios against a net-zero pathway.  I anticipate we ’ ll hear a real articulation of the need for the finance industry—banks, assets managers, asset owners, or other stakeholders—to mobilize and align on climate efforts. Elsewhere, we may see countries deliver on the goal, set in 2009, to commit $100 billion to help developing nations confront climate change. 5. Germany’s transition Dr. Ruth Heuss , McKinsey senior partner This past summer, Germany passed a new edition of the Climate Protection Act, which sets the national goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2045. As Europe’s largest national economy and a major exporter, Germany plays a central role in the continent’s transformation toward climate neutrality. While the country is in a strong starting position, none of this will be possible without concrete actions—specifically in the five most emissions-intensive sectors: energy, industry, transportation, buildings, and agriculture. What I’m hoping will come from COP26 is a crystallization of such plans along with a commitment to incubate new business models and invest in physical assets and new technologies. This, however, depends on bold and committed decision makers and broad citizen support. Such action would have meaningful implications for strengthening Germany’s position as an industrial hub and for creating new jobs for the future. 6. Nature conservation Duko Hopman , McKinsey associate partner Since the release of our research on the value of nature conservation last year, more and more stakeholders realize the climate and biodiversity crises are mutually enforcing and can’t be solved in isolation. Our models show that a 1.5-degree pathway cannot be achieved without major investments in nature. Similarly, without addressing the climate-change crisis, biodiversity—both in terms of species variety as well as population sizes—will continue its current tailspin. At McKinsey, our nature analytics experts partner with clients in this space. We’re particularly excited about innovation in nature-based solutions for a couple reasons: First, the impact goes beyond climate outcomes. Our own research shows nature conversation has the potential for at least $500 billion in GDP creation, job creation for 30 million, and significant improvement for rural, remote communities. And second, while we think there’s a huge role for technology to play in decarbonization, much of it will take years to scale. Nature-based opportunities are readily available at-scale today, including well-established approaches, such as the protection or restoration of forests and mangroves, along with more innovative or emerging solutions, such as the protection or restoration of seagrass or salt-marsh ecosystems, managing boreal forest fires, or growing seaweed offshore. 7. Climate adaptation Mekala Krishnan , McKinsey partner Adaptation is critically important. Our research shows that climate-related physical risks will continue to rise, regardless of what progress we may make on emissions cuts. Some amount of warming is still guaranteed because of the physical inertia of earth systems; as a result, we need to have measures in place to manage that rising risk. These measures are particularly important because physical risk has everything to do with our own lives and livelihoods—it has an impact on livability, workability, physical assets, natural capital, and more. It’s important to our clients because of the potential impact to their operations, supply chains, and customers, and more broadly, it’s potential impact to the communities we all live in. The good news is that we’re seeing more enthusiasm about climate adaptation—in part because we are simply seeing more impact from rising physical hazards. But I think COVID-19 has affected our awareness, too, because of how many knock-on effects the pandemic, which began as a public health issue, are re-shaping our socioeconomic systems. Both governments and corporates, for example, are increasingly integrating climate risk into decision making. So, just as we expect to see new commitments to net zero at COP26, we hope to see stakeholders commit to more on adaptation measures, too.

Here’s what makes them stay. October 28, 2021 From defining a new hybrid workplace, to navigating supply chain disruption, to retaining exceptional talent amid the great attrition, leaders and organizations today are facing unparalleled challenges. Core to performing in this environment is having a tightened focus on an organization’s health—its ability to align around and achieve strategic goals. Research shows that healthy organizations excel in three areas: attracting and developing their people, investing in the right capabilities for their goals, and designing their organizations for speed and innovation. We spoke with two leaders of McKinsey’s People & Organizational Performance Practice, Michael Park and Dana Maor , on what they’re hearing from clients and how we’re helping them navigate the topic. You’re both laser-focused on the people part of an organization. How did you get interested in the topic? Michael: McKinsey was my first job after college. I honestly never thought I’d join this practice but found that in my performance transformation and strategy work, the biggest constraints I saw in organizations over and over again typically stemmed from people and culture issues. In my earlier days, I thought this area was “soft stuff,” but I learned that when we really energized people and brought the organization along together towards unified goals was when we saw the greatest success in our client work. Dana: I started my professional life as a computer scientist and joined McKinsey to crack the toughest problems. I quickly learned that solving the problem is only half the battle and doesn’t truly move the needle or make a difference.  Whether at McKinsey or with clients, truly making a difference involves changing how companies and teams operate. It’s about helping individuals understand the capabilities, mindsets, and behaviors they need to be successful and then helping them get there.  This shifted my focus from the what to the how, from a focus on solving problems to a focus on empowering individuals. If individuals are empowered, they can solve the problems. With CEOs prioritizing people-related issues now more than ever, what’s top-of-mind for them? Dana: Change at the accelerated scale, scope, and pace we’re seeing today is the new normal. The pandemic has changed people, business, and society forever—which has created a mix of challenges and opportunities. Talent attrition is on the rise, well-being is on the decline, and the demand for highly-skilled talent is only intensifying. In our research, 40 percent of employees are likely to leave their current job in the next three to six months, and 85 percent of workers report that their well-being has declined with the pandemic. Michael: Over the last 24 months, every employer has been scrambling to meet the needs of a fast-changing workforce. Too often this means playing defense, reacting to the next obstacle. Now is the time for leaders to go on offense, to build environments that attract talent, and create a people and organizational competitive advantage. This is an opportunity to do away with bureaucracy and non-value-added processes and meetings, and really re-think how an organization works. As the adrenaline from that initial crisis-response period wears off, organizations must figure out how to move faster and be more customer-centric and modern. How are these changes impacting the way McKinsey serves clients? Michael: For starters, there is no longer a case that needs to be made to convince leaders to focus on people and the way an organization operates. Our research shows that most transformations fail —usually for reasons related to people and culture. Our clients know they have to get this right. And so, we’ve focused our offerings around outcomes that create the space and capacity for speed and innovation. One example of how we’re doing this is by helping clients build faster, leaner, more resilient and modern organizations. We’re tapping into a wide range of our capabilities, from McKinsey Academy —our entity for skill-building and leadership development—to assets like our Organizational Health Index that puts quantification and real interventions against previously-considered “soft” organizational issues. Dana: We recognize that today business transformation is the new reality of business as usual. Our clients need to crack the code for sustaining change to achieve the outcomes they desire. We help our clients deliver that lasting change, drawing on our organization experts, implementation coaches, Aberkyn change facilitators, and a wide range of diagnostics and assets. This starts with getting them to articulate a clear purpose from the top that is understood at all levels of the organization, inspiring purposeful leadership, shifting mindsets and behaviors, and equipping people with the required skills and behaviors to grow and sustain performance. Ultimately, people make change happen. Organizations that put people at the heart of all they do are the ones that will come out ahead. People & Organizational Performance You mention speed. How do we think about enabling fast-moving companies to do more? Michael: First you start with the critical priorities that flow through an organization—both to create value and to preserve value. Then you get to quantifiable objectives and metrics at each level that support these priorities. Most leaders get these steps right. The real differentiator from there is to allocate resources and people to the areas that matter most and create a performance culture that sustains. One of my clients regularly asks his teams at the end of a meeting what is the most important thing they’re working on.  After they answer, he then asks if they have the best person to do it. And so often the answer is no. From an organizational structure standpoint, we’re moving away from functional hierarchy to having greater fluidity in place. Organize people around things that matter and are relevant to their roles. This means creating small cross-functional teams oriented towards specific goals for set periods of times. Dana: Talent is at the crux of all this. A company’s talent agenda has to start with those junctions and roles in the organization that will unleash the most value. Companies need to map out their existing talent gaps and determine who they need to engage in the workforce to fill them. We’re working with clients to build attractive value propositions to get the right people to join, to develop people and to retain them. This means building a culture of accountability where people take ownership of their work, rather than rely on upper management for direction. And all throughout, technology needs to be a driving force that everyone can make use of. Particularly post-pandemic, when many face the talent attrition challenge, there is a window of opportunity to attract and retain some of the best people that will make a difference to an organization. Lastly, what excites you most about building organizations fit for the future? Dana: So much of this is about building purpose, mission, and experience into the value proposition. People want to be part of an organization that makes a difference—for the world, their own community, and for themselves—and organizations that are well set up to attract the best people will be best positioned to successfully deliver. I’m energized by the opportunity to create organizations that place emphasis on people’s potential by empowering them with the skills, mindsets, and behaviors to achieve their goals. This includes putting health and well-being at the center to enable them to achieve sustainable performance. An organization that takes care of its people’s needs, invests in expanding their capacity, focuses their time on what matters the most to them, and allows them to thrive, will win. Michael: There is tremendous potential in creating individuals and teams that achieve high performance, which in turn will lead to sustainable performance in organizations. The role of the company in people’s lives has changed. It’s now about thinking how to be the place people want to work versus have to work, and a big part of that is creating a culture of learning and adaptability so people have the skills required to perform their jobs within the company—and for when they leave. When people are cared for, can focus on what matters most, enjoy their day-to-day experience, and deliver on their purpose, individual performance will peak, organizational health will be at an all-time high, and the organization itself will achieve high performance sustainably. related ‘Great Attrition’ or ‘Great Attraction’?

The transgender work experience? &ldquo;People need to feel safe.&rdquo;,"New research on the transgender work experience highlights anxieties and stress, and outlines steps companies can take to deepen inclusion.",2021-11-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/the%20transgender%20work%20experience/transgenderreport-hero-small-1278624531-1536x864.jpg,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-transgender-work-experience-people-need-to-feel-safe,"The transgender work experience? “People need to feel safe.” November 12, 2021 Simple courtesies can go a long way. For one participant in our new study, Being transgender at work , the option to add a preferred name in addition to a legal name on a student ID made a world of difference. “It meant that I didn’t have to awkwardly email professors before the semester started,” the participant said. “It was done automatically. That was incredible.” Gender identities: A partial glossary Gender identity One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. Transgender An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth. Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual orientation. Therefore, transgender people may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. Cisgender A term used to describe a person whose gender identity aligns with those typically associated with the sex assigned to them at birth. Gender non-conforming A broad term referring to people who do not behave in a way that conforms to the traditional expectations of their gender, or whose gender expression does not fit neatly into a category. While many also identify as transgender, not all gender non-conforming people do. Nonbinary An adjective describing a person who does not identify exclusively as a man or a woman. Non-binary people may identify as being both a man and a woman, somewhere in between, or as falling completely outside these categories. While many also identify as transgender, not all non-binary people do. Non-binary can also be used as an umbrella term encompassing identities such as agender, bigender, genderqueer, or gender-fluid. Genderqueer Genderqueer people typically reject notions of static categories of gender and embrace a fluidity of gender identity and often, though not always, sexual orientation. People who identify as “genderqueer” may see themselves as being both male and female, neither male nor female, or as falling completely outside those categories. Gender-fluid A person who does not identify with a single fixed gender or has a fluid or unfixed gender identity. Gender dysphoria Clinically significant distress caused when a person's assigned birth gender is not the same as the one with which they identify. Gender transition The process by which some people strive to more closely align their internal knowledge of gender with its outward appearance. Some people socially transition, whereby they might begin dressing, using names and pronouns and/or be socially recognized as another gender. Others undergo physical transitions in which they modify their bodies through medical interventions. *Source: https://www.hrc.org/resources/glossary-of-terms This sort of inclusive action is just a first step. Our new report is based on US government data, McKinsey research, 500+ online surveys, and in-depth interviews. It provides first-time insights into the participation, plight, and precarious existence that transgender people have experienced in the workplace and in their lives. David Baboolall (they/them), a McKinsey associate partner, led the research. David is one of three children born to a mother from Namibia and a father from Guyana. They grew up in Jamaica, Queens, and attended the Bronx High School of Science. “It was the turning point in my life,” David says. “It was demanding, with three hours of commuting a day, but it prepared me well and opened up my future.” At Carnegie Mellon University, they earned degrees in engineering and computer science and following several internships joined McKinsey, where they serve private-equity clients and lead projects on diversity , equity, and inclusion. David was inspired to take on this research in addition to their consulting work. “There had been some shining moments of inspiration in the research, but far more evidence of steps backwards,” David says. “The research findings paint a picture of a community that is marginalized, poor, and living with a high level of stress. And this year, we saw the highest number of transgender murders to date. With all of this oppression, now is the time to fight for rights.” In the US, according to the new report, 29 percent of transgender adults live in poverty compared to less than 8 percent of the US population as a whole. Transgender adults are twice as likely as cisgender adults to be unemployed; and when they do have a job, they earn one-third less than cisgender people, even with an equal or higher level of education. More than half of transgender employees say they are not comfortable being out at work. This may lead to limiting themselves to certain industries, with 59 percent of survey respondents citing safety as a concern. Once hired, they are more likely to report a sense of alienation and insecurity among their colleagues and managers. The feeling of not being able to bring their whole selves to work can induce a sense of stress that can inhibit them from fully participating. “I decided a while ago that I’m just going to get through work until I can retire,” explains one worker in a manufacturing plant. “The goal is to not be fully out–it’s just to not feel unsafe, like I did in my previous job. I can survive being closeted for now.” Greater transgender inclusion in the workforce would benefit everyone, David explains. “If everything was equitable in terms of pay and employment between cisgender folks and transgender folks,” they say, “we projected that there would be an additional $12 billion in consumer spending.” But to develop more inclusive cultures requires a better understanding of the transgender experience, which can mean education and training. Being transgender at work For instance, one of the questions in the survey was: What types of training and/or education would be most helpful for you related to trans inclusion? And what questions do you have? “Twenty percent of cisgender respondents said they would absolutely not be open to attending any learning courses, seminars, and so forth. I was shocked by the vehemence of some of the responses,” says David. They add: “I think this points to some ignorance when it comes to sexual orientation, and then more specifically to gender identity. I believe many individuals, not only across the US, but across the world, have never had a conversation about it. Awareness and education are blatantly missing. This research is hopefully one first step.” The report outlines initiatives that companies can take to create a more inclusive culture including recruiting, onboarding, benefits, and cultural and management training. Several participants' responses described their value. “Support groups and communities,” said one response, “can be instrumental to feeling accepted and included in a company, in society.” You can say, ‘I’m committed to making you feel included and ensuring that you can bring your whole self to work every day.’ An opt-in community of some 60 trans people at McKinsey meet monthly to share information about their projects, resources, and opportunities. “People need to feel safe at work to be fully engaged. Today there is not enough momentum or energy in the world to create those spaces for transgender people, so they need to do this for themselves,” says David. Our research has shown that if companies can step up to create more inclusive environments, the reward will be more fully engaged employees. It’s a complex and nuanced challenge for any leader. “It can start with having a candid conversation with the transgender person who’s on your team,” offers David. “You can say, ‘I’m committed to making you feel included and ensuring that you can bring your whole self to work every day. And I’d love to work with you to ensure that that happens.’” related Building inclusion at scale, one nudge at a time Burnout, leadership, and hope: A year-and-a-half into the pandemic, looking at Women in the Workplace Never miss a story"
"For our Rethinking Recycling initiative, a new pathway to growth: Delterra","Three years since its launch, McKinsey.org&rsquo;s waste management program is transitioning to become the flagship initiative of a new environmental nonprofit.",2021-11-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinseyorgs%20rethinking%20recycling%20program%20gets%20a%20new%20home%20delterra/delterra-hero-small-bali-1536x864.jpg,"Social Impact,Sustainability",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-org-rethinking-recycling-program-gets-a-new-home-delterra,"For our Rethinking Recycling initiative, a new pathway to growth: Delterra November 19, 2021 Many waste and recycling systems around the world are under-developed. Some struggle against pollutive and exploitative practices, and few provide transparency or traceability. The reason for this can be tied to a pernicious cycle of insufficient supply and unreliable demand for recyclables. While communities lack the infrastructure to deliver clean, ethically sourced material to recycling markets, weak demand from industry undermines the business case for investing in that infrastructure. To help solve this issue, McKinsey.org —a private foundation founded by McKinsey—incubated Rethinking Recycling, an initiative to create a globally scalable model to manage waste and help communities rapidly increase the amount of material recycled into productive use. Three years later, Rethinking Recycling is now the flagship initiative of Delterra , a new environmental nonprofit. To hear more about its vision and plans behind the spin-off, we spoke with McKinsey global social responsibility leader Anu Gupta . Tell us about McKinsey.org and its ambitions. We founded McKinsey.org in 2014 to develop innovative approaches to the world’s most pressing problems, like unemployment and climate change. Through it we’ve incubated new, scalable solutions to societal issues by applying McKinsey’s capabilities and by partnering with leaders from the private, public, and social sectors. The first initiative of McKinsey.org was Generation , which focuses on the intractable challenge of global youth unemployment. We spun Generation off in 2017 as its own nonprofit, and today nearly 50,000 people have graduated. Over 80 percent are employed within three months of the program’s completion. In 2018, we launched our second initiative, Rethinking Recycling , to address the challenge of circularity and the opportunity around recycling. What started as proof-of-concepts in 2019 in Argentina and Indonesia has matured into scale-up programs that address entire cities or multiple villages at once. These are now projected to give up to 15 million people access to daily segregated waste collection services by 2025. Rethinking Recycling has now become the flagship initiative of a new nonprofit, Delterra. How will we support the nonprofit going forward? In just three years since its launch, we’ve helped Rethinking Recycling develop community-owned, self-sustaining waste management systems that produce a reliable stream of high-value recyclables. On the demand side, we’ve worked with corporate players to build aggregation, inventory traceability, and logistics solutions, and to create local markets to consistently absorb the supply of recycled material at a fair price. For example, the program partnered with city staff and local labor cooperatives in Buenos Aires to provide residents with door-to-door waste collection and recycling services. Cooperatives now benefit from the income generated by the sale of recyclables. To continue to build on this success, McKinsey.org will provide $6 million in multi-year funding as well as a $3.5 million challenge grant. The most valuable support, however, will be in the form of our people. As we’ve done with Generation, McKinsey consultants will commit to six to 12 months as fellows with Delterra. Through problem-solving skills, stakeholder management abilities, and functional expertise, the fellows will help realize Rethinking Recycling’s goal to deliver green, inclusive, and economic recycling to countries across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. What drove this transition and why now? This is about growth and scale. Rethinking Recycling is ready to scale—to new cities, regions, and countries. Over the past three years, the initiative has improved the livelihoods of more than 450 waste workers, many of whom are marginalized women, by increasing their salaries by up to 200 percent and providing them with access to health care and safe working environments, often for the first time. As a new environmental nonprofit, we believe Delterra is the right place to grow the Rethinking Recycling initiative to have even more impact. 2020 Social Responsibility Report As we look to the future, what are McKinsey’s plans for helping to create positive, enduring change in the world? Our aspiration as a firm is to help create sustainable and inclusive growth and commit to social responsibility. From serving clients, to developing insights, to giving back to our communities, and acting responsibly as a firm, sustainability is embedded in everything we do.  We are on a journey, and our recent social responsibility report shares our commitments that include racial and social equity, achieving a net-zero future, and our goal to provide $2 billion in cash and in-kind support to social responsibility efforts by 2030. Finally, you mention our social responsibility report. Leave us with one story from the report that makes you feel proud. One story that is very close to my heart is the Rethinking Recycling team’s response to the challenges COVID-19 brought to the communities they served in Argentina in early 2020. When the pandemic hit, newly established recycling centers shut down, which deprived essential workers of earned income.  In response, Rethinking Recycling teams focused their efforts on food security for the affected waste workers and their families.  In collaboration with government agencies and sponsors, they helped to distribute thousands of food packages and continued working to protect the health of the communities in which they were living in. related How green waste management led to COVID-19 relief in Buenos Aires Never miss a story"
Bob Sternfels: “We should accept nothing less” than sustainable and inclusive growth,"At the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, our global managing partner called on business leaders to work together, embrace long-term capital, and drive bold change.",2021-12-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/bob%20sternfels%20we%20should%20accept%20nothing%20less%20than%20sustainable%20and%20inclusive%20growth/bloombergneweconomyforum-hero-small-bob3-1536x864.jpg,"Global Managing Partner,Inclusive Economy,Managing Partner",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/bob-sternfels-we-should-accept-nothing-less-than-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth,"Bob Sternfels: “We should accept nothing less” than sustainable and inclusive growth McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels on stage at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. December 1, 2021 In a ‘firestarter’ speech to help kick off Bloomberg’s recent New Economy Forum in Singapore, our global managing partner Bob Sternfels described high stakes around two “radically different paths” this decade could take. He urged leaders to act with courage in driving a “new age of prosperity” that would create a better quality of life for people and a more sustainable future for our planet. On the high-stakes of the next decade I could paint two very different scenarios for how this decade could play out. The first: A new age of prosperity. GDP could grow 30 to 50 percent over this decade with a better quality of life for most people. A more sustainable future for our planet. True sustainable and inclusive growth. That’s one path. The second path doesn’t look so good. It has tepid economic recovery. Only 10 to 20 percent increase in GDP growth. Less equitable distribution. It’s less sustainable, with worse outcomes for global health and the environment. So, two radically different paths — and the stakes couldn’t be higher. If we don’t substantially improve the net-zero commitments that we’ve all made, we’ll have one billion people living in lethal heat by 2050. Seven of 10 people today live in societies with growing inequality, and we’ve seen the massive stress that places on both public and private institutions. And in terms of economic growth, the bookend scenarios have never been wider than they are today as we forecast what could be. On the opportunity to create sustainable and inclusive growth At McKinsey we’ve done some modeling, and we believe that we could have three to four percent per annum GDP growth over this decade from existing technologies. Similarly, if we look at Europe in particular,  those same technologies could abate 85 percent of the carbon [in that region] today. And if you look at job creation, there is a scenario with substantial net job growth over this decade. It requires investment in sectors from infrastructure to health care to energy. In fact, done right, job growth can outstrip jobs dislocated through technology two to one. But it requires the right focus on upskilling. The goals of sustainability, inclusion, and growth can reinforce each other and create a virtuous circle. More inclusive health care could add half a point to global GDP growth by 2040. Advancing women’s economic potential in the workforce could add $ 13 trillion to global GDP growth. And growth rates for sustainable products and markets outstrip conventional ones 10 to 20 percent in all categories. On the barriers to driving enduring change Driving all three—sustainability, inclusion, and growth—won’t be easy and there’s some real tensions that need to be addressed. As technology is implemented at an ever faster rate, one hundred million people will need to be reskilled this decade. And energy transitions, if we don’t focus on inclusion, will be regressive. If I take the US alone, 60 percent of low-income households face severe energy burdens, meaning they spend over 10 percent of total household income on energy. Just transitions have to be a crucial component as we think about climate transition. And I think we all know, as business leaders, that 40 percent of our workforce right now wants to change jobs in the next six months. The regulatory environment is increasingly uncertain, and we have multiple stakeholders to manage. If we want to be bolder, all these things have to come together. On what it will take to lead forward I’d argue it is a time for us as leaders to embrace long-term capital and to be courageous. We need to work together, and we need to move quickly. In reaching for a sustainable and inclusive growth, we have to work across the public/private divide. It’s the only way we’ll find solutions for things like standards for climate; for a mechanism that creates real incentives to invest in human capital; and for a framework that allows R&D investments to accelerate over this decade and solve some of these toughest problems. We also have to move quickly. One thing that COVID has shown is that enterprise can move faster than any of us expected, which is good news because these problems aren’t going to be the problems of the next generation. They’re going to be the problems of our leadership generation. So the question I have is can we lock in this COVID speed to solve these particular issues. The choice is ours.

Based in Stockholm, Sweden, this group of 30+ experts specializes in helping clients develop sustainability strategies with a focus on “circularity,” detailed and data-driven approaches for sustainable materials systems in companies and across industries that optimize the use and reuse of products and materials. “By combining Material Economics’ capabilities and assets with McKinsey’s extensive network, we can broaden and deepen our sustainability offerings, and accelerate our ambition to create a global engine for sustainability operating from the region,” says Tomas Nauclér , co-leader of McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice . “We will be able to help clients with cutting-edge perspectives on circularity, detailed CO2 abatement strategies, and ultimately net-zero transformation.” The acquisition brings the professional journeys of Material Economics CEO and co-founder Per-Anders Enkvist , along with his co-founders Per Klevnäs and Robert Westerdahl , full circle: they are all McKinsey alumni and will be joining our firm’s Sustainability Practice . Per-Anders is a former McKinsey partner. He led McKinsey’s work related to climate change and co-developed the McKinsey greenhouse gas abatement cost curve , including 30+ national iterations. It’s one of the most used and quoted tools for thinking quantitatively about the economic, business, and social implications of mitigating climate change. For many companies, the pathway to net-zero includes a transition to renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power. However, according to Per-Anders, many organizations are not finding this to be enough. “Some 45 percent of global greenhouse gases arise from the production and use of basic materials, products, and food,” he says. “Company after company now finds it must address these challenges in their own production, supply chains, and business models. These issues have long been the focus of our work at Material Economics. I am really excited to join forces with McKinsey to have even more positive impact from the expertise and knowledge we have built up.” Material Economics brings extensive experience from a range of sustainability and circularity topics across advanced industries, basic materials, consumer, and other sectors. These include designing sustainable operational processes, recycled materials sourcing strategies, product portfolio makeovers, and complete sustainability transformation programs, as well as executive trainings. In addition to project experience, Material Economics brings a set of unique knowledge assets, developed through research with leading institutions. I am really excited to join forces with McKinsey to have even more positive impact from the expertise and knowledge we have built up. The acquisition further strengthens our firm’s ability to create sustainable and inclusive growth for our clients. “It enables us to help public- and private-sector organizations with holistic, end-to-end sustainability transformations,” says Tomas, “taking into consideration emission reductions from switching to renewable energy as well as reusing materials in production or recapturing products in the market.” Material Economics is McKinsey's third acquisition in Sustainability in 2021. Earlier this year, we announced the acquisition of Vivid Economics and Planetrics , a consultancy family with macroeconomic and analytic capabilities. These acquisitions will serve as the foundation for growing a global capability in sustainability and circularity, with the team expected to grow rapidly in geographies around the globe. related Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero What will it take to green seven of the hardest-to-abate industries?

December 2, 2021 This is How They Tell Me the World Ends (Bloomsbury 2021), Nicole Perlroth’s alarming look at the world of underground cyberarms, has been named the 2021 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year. “Digital sabotage,” Perlroth said after her win, “is the immediate threat that we can do something about—if we wake up. The goal of this book is to wake people up.” The book draws on nearly a decade of the author’s cybersecurity and digital espionage reporting for the New York Times , where she worked with hundreds of sources including hackers and government officials. On December 1, Perlroth left the Times to join a new committee with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “Maybe one day I will hopefully get back to journalism,” she said, “but in the meantime, the threat is too great for me to keep doing what I was doing.” McKinsey’s Europe managing partner Magnus Tyreman and Financial Times editor Roula Khalaf awarded the £30,000 prize during a live event at London’s National Gallery, where CBI director general Tony Danker was guest speaker. Along with the previous two winners, Sarah Frier and Caroline Criado-Perez , Perlroth becomes the third woman in a row to take the prize. “Nicole Perlroth has written a book that is more than just a timely wake-up call to the profound implications of the arms race among hackers, cybercriminals, businesses, and national governments,” Magnus said. “It is an alarming book, one in which the author makes a granular and matter-of-fact case demonstrating how vulnerable global computer systems have become and an urgent plea for specific and systematic action.” The judging panel was chaired by Khalaf, who said she hoped the book would be read, and paid attention to, by CEOs. Joining her on the panel were Mimi Alemayehou, senior vice president for public-private partnerships at Mastercard’s humanitarian and development group; Mitchell Baker, CEO, Mozilla; Mohamed El-Erian, president, Queens’ College, Cambridge, and advisor to Allianz and Gramercy; Herminia Ibarra, professor of organizational behavior, London Business School; James Kondo, chair, International House of Japan; Randall Kroszner, professor of economics and deputy dean for executive programs at University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business; Raju Narisetti, publisher, global publishing, McKinsey; and Shriti Vadera, chair, Prudential. The Bracken Bower Prize for the best business book proposal in 2021 by an author under 35 was also awarded at the event. Ines Lee and Eileen Tipoe’s proposal for Failing the Class , which looks at the future of higher education, was awarded the £15,000 prize.

The day culminates our year-round McKinsey Serves program, which enables all colleagues to serve their communities through volunteerism. The theme for this year’s Day of Service was “Building sustainable and inclusive economies.” It took place on December 3 in most McKinsey locations, ahead of the UN’s International Volunteer Day on Sunday, December 5. Throughout the day, colleagues participated in volunteer activities of their choice, like helping job-seekers with resumes and interview preparation, cleaning up parks and beaches, and preparing meals for emergency food programs. “Our purpose as a firm is to help create positive, enduring change in the world,” says Anu Gupta , leader of global social responsibility at McKinsey. “We enable every colleague to give time and financial support to the causes that they care about.” Colleagues can do that through programs that provide paid-time off to volunteer, match colleague donations to charities of their choosing, and give colleagues a say in McKinsey’s local charitable giving. On Day of Service, we also celebrate colleagues who exemplify the spirit of advancing inclusion and service across the globe with the announcement of our INservice Awards. Meet three of this year’s winners below. Palona Singh, junior business presentation specialist, India Throughout COVID-19, Palona volunteered for a charity in Bengaluru, coordinating food drives to provide meals to over 100,000 people. As the main point of contact between food distributors and recipients, she handled all of India’s operations and distributed oxygen cylinders and basic medicines to local government hospitals. Expanding beyond the charity’s existing services, Palona helped organize mental health seminars with leading psychologists and therapists. The topic holds particular significance to her, having struggled with mental health issues herself.  “It’s a topic too often stigmatized, which inspired me to help educate and inform people about it,” she says. Palona did this by managing the charity’s social media accounts and engaging with psychologists and therapists about how this issue can be tackled. Nearly 500 people joined the seminars, shared their own personal experiences, and talked about how relieved they felt to have this forum. Laura Correa, senior knowledge analyst, Mexico Over a year and a half ago, Laura helped found the social impact team for McKinsey’s Mexico City office. As part of the leadership team of three colleagues, she’s spearheaded the office’s volunteering efforts with educational and social entrepreneurship nonprofits by creating and assigning teams to each pro bono effort. Laura has worked on the five-year strategy for these organizations, helping to streamline their objectives around poverty, environmental conservation, and health and to identify what key performance indicators they could benefit from measuring. “I’ve always been passionate about volunteering and feel it offers me different perspectives to live a more conscious and sustainable life,” she says. “Being able to tap into the knowledge and skills of McKinsey has enabled me to continue these efforts and even start new ones.” Some other initiatives Laura leads include helping create greater awareness among colleagues in the Mexico City office on the importance of sustainability and responsible consumption. She leads our Fuel Ignition Club that helps startups focused on sustainability and inclusion connect with investors and corporate innovators. Last year, the club helped a Mexican financial inclusion platform that delivers credit solutions to low-income populations. Azat Myrzagaliyev, associate, Kazakhstan A crowdsourcing post on Instagram for an organization that provides prostheses for children with disabilities caught Azat’s attention over a year ago. What first began as financing support quickly evolved into a desire to help the organization grow and improve processes throughout Kazakhstan. After a few months, Azat got McKinsey involved through activities, such as helping secure a bionic arm prosthesis for a teenager in need and engaging McKinsey partner colleagues in launching pro bono projects to support the organization. “I believe in thinking globally, and acting locally,” says Azat. “If each person focuses on one particular area of giving back, the potential to create change is limitless.” related Celebrating servant leadership on our global ‘Day of Service’ Never miss a story"
What makes the US Latino population an untapped engine for growth?,"A researcher on McKinsey&rsquo;s first US Latino economic study walks us through the research, which shows a high-degree of entrepreneurship amid gaps in equity.",2021-12-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/what%20makes%20the%20us%20latino%20population%20an%20engine%20for%20growth/latinoecon-hero-small-1009603322-1536x864.jpg,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/what-makes-the-us-latino-population-an-engine-for-growth,"What makes the US Latino population an untapped engine for growth? December 10, 2021 “Entrepreneurship is in our blood,” says Ana Paula Calvo, a McKinsey engagement manager who is a Latina. She was born in Mexico City, but grew up between the US and Mexico. Her grandmother always had a passion for baking and in 1990, started a bakery business in Mexico City. It started with ten employees, expanded to four locations, and her mother actually works there today. One close friend opened an environmental contracting firm in Florida, while another expanded a multi-generational family business in the US. Entrepreneurship is also a recurring theme in McKinsey’s first comprehensive study of Latino economic mobility— The economic state of Latinos in America: The American dream deferred —which Ana led earlier this year. It analyzes the roles of Latinos as workers, savers, business owners, and consumers in the US economy. Latinos are an economic engine for the US. They are the fastest growing minority: by 2030, 1 in 5 workers will be Latino. And they have the highest rate of entrepreneurship of any race: their businesses have grown by 12.5 percent over the past five years, compared to 5.3 percent for White-owned businesses. “For many, when we come to the US, it’s to create a better life,” explains Ana. “And if building our own business is going to help us, then that's the path we’ll take.” Ana’s colleagues on the research team could see this spirit playing out in their own lives. In a quick anecdotal survey, five Latino members of the team could identify some 15+  businesses started by their own families or close friends. They included a restaurant and catering business in Boston, a private equity firm in New York, and a media-and-events company in Miami, to name a few. But our report also surfaced the challenges Latino entrepreneurs face in securing the capital they need to grow. They rely more on family savings, credit cards, and personal assets to start businesses, and they are less likely to apply for funding because they don’t think they will receive approval. Their businesses also tend to be underrepresented in higher growth industries, and many need to invest in a stronger digital presence, which is critical to grow. “If we could close the gap so that the number of Latino businesses was in line with their share of the population, some 735,000 new businesses could be added to the US economy, supporting 6.6. million new jobs,” Ana points out. One of the insights that surfaced in the research is the fact that any resources or programs focused on supporting economic mobility need to take into account the many differences among Latino populations, bucking the common misperception that they are a monolithic group. Distinctions among the population include whether they are US or foreign born and their country of origin. The economic state of Latinos in America: The American dream deferred “These nuances are reflected in the work they do, earning power, educational level, location, and political views,” says Ana. “For example, for Mexicans, the top occupational groups are farming, fishing, forestry, and construction. For Puerto Ricans, it’s transportation and the military. In terms of education, only 8 percent of Mexican-origin Latino immigrants have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 27 percent of Cuban origin.” Once a family emigrates to the US, in general, the first generation does well; the rates of intergenerational mobility and earnings are comparable to the White population. Latinos are willing to move or change jobs for advancement, and the share of Latinos stepping into higher paying industries has increased 5 percent over the past decade. But they are less likely to receive an inheritance; when they do it’s less by a factor of three than that of non-Latino White people. And almost a third are supporting families back home. At McKinsey in the US, we have colleagues from countries and regions including Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. “The Latino presence in our Miami office is very high, and I can feel an immediate point of connection within that community,” says Ana. Her advice to a young Latino starting a career? “Our overall outlook is positive, we do achieve upward mobility, and we are starting businesses. Be proud, and don’t forget where you and your family come from,” Ana says. “I spent most of my childhood in the US, but my parents always spoke to us in Spanish at home. When I moved back to Mexico City when I was fifteen, it was easy to immerse myself. It's a competitive advantage; we can connect easily to both non-Latinos and Latinos.” related A first step to racial equality? “Fundamentally improve job quality.” At our first Hispanic and Latino Economic Forum, leaders unite to focus on jobs Never miss a story"

Over the course of the year, the institute has focused on its mission to help private-, public-, and social-sector leaders take coordinated action to accelerate Black economic development. The institute’s work has included publishing in-depth research on the racial wealth gap, increasing Black representation in the workforce, the impact of COVID-19 on Black livelihoods and more. It has also convened leaders to discuss best practices and partnered with more than 20 organizations across industries to improve the economic mobility for Black individuals and communities. As we look to 2022, we spoke with some Institute leaders about lessons from the past year, what’s next, and how organizations can best embed racial equity into their long-term planning. Duwain Pinder It’s been fascinating to see the evolution of our research go from being more reactive to taking on a more proactive lens. Before we launched the Institute, we had published an article on the effect of COVID-19 on Black lives and livelihoods, which was, of course, extremely topical at the time. Yet since then, we’ve become more proactive in researching where the private sector can engage to accelerate Black economic mobility. For example, we’ve partnered with our practices, like Agriculture on ways to support Black farmers , Education on the role of HBCUs , and Retail on how brands can meet the needs of diverse consumers. Through this work, we’ve seen the Institute’s impact become a force multiplier with more colleagues engaged and looking to embed our findings into the long-term strategies of their clients. Our work is beginning to change the way our entire firm operates and interacts with clients. Tiffany Burns For so long, there’s been an aspiration for a fact base that can give businesses the rationale for what they should do as it relates to racial equity. The institute has supported that by taking something like inclusive growth and articulating the magnitude of its opportunities in a very analytical and structured way. Ninety percent of organizations have stated they want to take action, and we’ve seen that much of this happens when the framing of the problem along with the financial opportunity are clear. When you see a client document with a roadmap anchored in analysis that we’ve done, that’s when you know we’ve had impact. The demand for such insights is only going up along with the desire to expand the institute through partnerships with broader corporate entities and industry organizations. Monne Williams Quick wins don’t work. These are systemic issues that have taken generations of people to ingrain into society. The sobering moment came when working on our ‘ Race in the workplace’ report that showed it would take nearly a century for Black workers to reach talent parity, or 12 percent Black representation in the US private sector. For organizations to begin to dismantle these inequities, having a multi-pronged plan that looks beyond the hiring of Black people to also consider aspects like fair promotions and entire career trajectories is key. It means thinking outside the walls of your company to consider factors like supplier strategy to ensure your products and services are available to a broader consumer base, or office location to close the gap between high-growth geographies and predominately Black neighborhoods. As we think about what’s next for the Institute, we will be especially focused on how we can be active participants and conveners among the private, public, and social sectors to help drive knowledge and best practice sharing—something that’s been lacking for far too long. McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility Ammanuel Zegeye Beyond the moral imperative of racial equity, what’s been most powerful to come from the Institute’s research is the strong economic case for it. Once you combine the two and put it into quantitative and qualitative ways to capture what’s going on, it’s really hard to ignore. For example, our Black representation in film and TV report  showed that the industry is missing out on $10B in revenue annually as a result of fewer Black-led stories, underfunding,  and undervaluation once ideas are shared. Money is being left on the table, and people understanding that is a huge driver for action. We’ve had over 100 client conversations following this report on how to have impact in this sector. The question for leaders is now thinking whether racial equity should be a differentiator or table stakes. Shelley Stewart III Embedding racial equity into long-term, strategic planning requires institutional change and investment. For example, ‘ The economic state of Black America ’ found that more than half of the $226 billion wage gap that exists between Black and White Americans was concentrated in just 20 industries. Such insights provide industry leaders with a solid starting point so they can thoughtfully pursue efforts that are most impactful in improving Black economic mobility. One way is by increasing representation of underrepresented groups within their organizations, especially among the leadership ranks, and evaluating their company’s current relationships with these groups as consumers. I’m optimistic that companies are leaning into these conversations, and we’re seeing strong indications that significant time and resources are beginning to be committed to issues of racial inequity. Yet, we're still at the very beginning of the journey. There remain a lot of siloed efforts with many people doing this work because it interests them in the moment. To meaningfully address issues of this magnitude, however, we need to ensure collective and sustained action. related Introducing the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility Never miss a story"

Leads internal McKinsey product managers and our Technology & Digital function's AI studio. Serves as McKinsey’s chief technology officer. December 20, 2021 We’re living in a new age of AI and automation. Robots and computers, long used for performing routine physical tasks, are now more cognitively capable than ever. Businesses are increasingly adopting these technologies to aid and scale deep thinking and analysis. For instance, nearly two-thirds of 1,000 business executives we surveyed said they plan to increase their investments in AI. We do, too, and we’ve already begun. Our Technology & Digital function works inside McKinsey to innovate firm tools and processes, ensuring we bring the best to our clients. All of our people in the function are encouraged to solve problems, pursue new ideas, and launch new products. We felt that these innovations could take more advantage of AI or automation to achieve their aims. After some assessment, we realized that many of our colleagues in the function had an opportunity to learn more about AI and new techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning. We decided to invest in scaling these skills and capabilities. The state of AI in 2021 Our approach Our firm is a recognized industry leader in AI. We began this effort by embarking on a dual journey to add more data scientists at McKinsey, while at the same time upskilling our colleagues who already had some exposure to AI and automation. Hiring talent is important; new people bring new ideas and they can help quickly fill gaps in capabilities. But upskilling our existing talent is perhaps even more critical. Doing so provides them with the skills they need to succeed as the shift to AI continues, reduces disruption in existing methods, and helps our people feel motivated and engaged. Investing in existing talent also helps with successful deployment. After all, no one understands how to get things done—and make them stick—in your organization better than your own people. We developed an ambitious plan to upskill more than 500 colleagues in different roles for AI/machine learning techniques and their applications. The roles included leaders, business sponsors, product managers, user experience professionals, engineers, data experts, and support professionals. We also formed a focused team of about 20 AI experts and commenced the journey. The teams started with a concept of AI pods—mini three to four member teams of AI experts—that supplemented our product teams. Each focused on five elements throughout their assignments: defining and refining our AI strategy; convening allies; incubating and delivering use cases; building capabilities; and the dissemination and radiation of lessons learned to help upskill colleagues across the function. From our own client experience, we know that a one-size-fits-all training module would not be an optimal approach. Instead, it would have to cater to colleagues with varying degree of needs for AI techniques in their work. This led to the development of three levels of training, each with varying degrees of complexity and depth. They include: What we learned and achieved Through this program, we saw that successful upskilling happens quickest for people already in relevant product development roles: technology product managers up-skilled to AI product managers; software developers to machine-learning engineers; or data architects to data engineers. We aligned individuals with relevant ongoing projects to have hands-on experience and paired them with AI capable experts they could shadow and learn from. This combination of dedicated oversight support from our internal “AI Capable” colleagues and help from external experts on nuanced techniques enabled further upskilling.  Within six to nine months, we had them capable of an intermediate level of independent execution. An enthusiastic group of software professionals also chose to move to data science through a formal external data science course. These are colleagues who are upskilled for life, who have grown and developed in a way that will sustain them in their careers for the long term. We feel the effort has been hugely successful. In addition to the thousands of client-facing colleagues who work on AI for our clients, we have had about 100 Technology & Digital function colleagues qualify as “AI Ready” through this program. They now possess an intermediate knowledge of the AI product lifecycle, including topics such as data dependency, data infrastructure and architecture, data science techniques, and AI ROI. Meanwhile, more than 50 colleagues in the function are now “AI Capable,” and possess advanced skills to build complex AI solutions. These colleagues can now play roles like AI product manager, AI user experience expert, ML engineer, and data engineer or data scientist. And finally, more than 500 Technology & Digital function colleagues are now “AI Aware;” they understand AI applications in business, the power of data, and common AI use cases. These are colleagues who are upskilled for life, who have grown and developed in a way that will sustain them in their careers for the long term. That’s the kind of change we seek to create for our clients every day, and in this case we’ve made it possible by giving our people what we feel they are owed—skills that are fit for the future. related A new McKinsey council identifies today’s top tech trends for business leaders McKinsey named a “Leader” in AI Never miss a story"

January 12, 2022 Mentor, friend, sponsor, leader, loving father and husband—these are just some of the ways McKinsey colleagues and alumni   remember Robert “Bob” Holland, who passed away December 22, 2021, after battling Parkinson’s disease. A giant in our field, Bob was known for his dedication to young talent, many of whom are now leaders in their own right, and his passion for impact with clients. Bob was a role model throughout his distinguished career at our firm and beyond, including his 1995 appointment to CEO of Ben and Jerry’s. His journey at our firm led him to become McKinsey’s first Black partner and inspired the creation of the McKinsey Black Network (MBN). His impact was an inspiration to many, including Dame Vivian Hunt, a McKinsey senior partner based in London and a current leader of the McKinsey Black Network. “MBN now has nearly a thousand members with many active allies, and this is in large part due to the hard work and sacrifices that Bob made throughout his career,” she says. Vivian first met Bob when she was a summer associate in 1994. Beyond his client work, she remembers Bob as a pioneering leader who believed in the importance of giving back. “Bob dedicated much of his time and energy to serving vulnerable communities, particularly in the education space, motivated by his own personal experiences and childhood,” she says. Those personal experiences included growing up in Albion, Michigan, the third of five children, raised by parents who were not formally educated but believed deeply in the importance of education. Bob’s experience and memories of a segregated ice cream parlor in Albion inspired him to write a poem before becoming CEO of Ben & Jerry’s. He earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Union College in 1962. “I got on the bus to go to Union College [a 26-hour ride],” he said in an interview with Black Enterprise . “It was the first time I’d been out of Michigan. That was not the last blind journey I would take, but the first of many.” Bob later studied at Bernard Baruch Graduate School, receiving a masters of business administration in international marketing. He joined McKinsey in 1968, becoming a partner and serving until 1981, before embarking on a number of CEO and board roles in manufacturing, furniture, banking and, of course, ice cream. As Shelley Stewart III, McKinsey partner and leader of the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility , says: “Bob Holland’s legacy and impact on generations of Black colleagues inside and outside of McKinsey is unrivaled. There is a direct link between Bob’s commitment to make careers in consulting more accessible to Black people and McKinsey’s overall diversity, equity and inclusion platform—including McKinsey’s 10 Actions towards racial equity .” Indeed, as colleagues learned the news of Bob’s passing, hundreds of tributes came in from those who had been inspired by him. ""Thank you, Bob, for your legacy and steadfastness in leading the way. We stand on your shoulders,” wrote Makini Hughes, an engagement manager based in New York. “I first learned of Bob in graduate school over 20 years ago and was inspired by his journey,” wrote Claudy Jules, a partner based in Washington, D.C. “While I never benefited from meeting him, his legacy of excellence and leadership impact continues to inspire me. Thank you, Bob, for being a trailblazer.” Bob’s legacy also remains an inspiration to those who’ve since left the firm. ""I was blessed to have interacted with Bob during the early days of the McKinsey Black Network,” says Margaret Brooks, who served as program manager for the McKinsey Black Network for many years. “He was a true inspiration. He worked tirelessly to pave the way for Black colleagues to thrive at McKinsey."" Former McKinsey colleague and dear friend James Lowry also recalls: “Bob worked hard and persevered to become the first Black Partner at McKinsey, and one of the first in the industry. He worked diligently to perform at the highest level for his many clients, while also serving as a role model for those Black and non-Black consultants that followed him. Bob Holland was a giant in the field and more importantly a giant as a husband, father and a dear friend.” Never miss a story"
Bob Sternfels in the Wall Street Journal: How do you move from &ldquo;proving yourself to improving yourself?&rdquo;,"Our global managing partner talks about his approach to leading McKinsey, what he&rsquo;s hearing from CEOs, and more in a new interview.",2022-01-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/bob%20sternfels%20in%20the%20wall%20street%20journal%20january%202022/bobwsjqa-hero-small-story-1536x864.jpg,Managing Partner,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/bob-sternfels-in-the-wall-street-journal-january-2022,"Bob Sternfels in the Wall Street Journal: How do you move from “proving yourself to improving yourself?” January 12, 2022 In a Wall Street Journal interview published January 7, our global managing partner Bob Sternfels talked about his career, his vision for our firm, and the changes we’re making to help our clients achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. Read on for edited highlights, or head over to the Wall Street Journal [paywall] for the full interview. On his top priorities Three words come to mind: courageous, inclusive and faster. What our clients are saying is, as leaders, none of them want to miss the moment. And so my goal is how do we have the courage to help them do something they normally wouldn’t have done. The inclusive is actually about us; we’ve come a long way in terms of the composition of our firm, but I think we’ve only scratched the surface. On being faster, the world’s never going to slow down again, and our clients are demanding that we move faster than they do. So how do we create a model that can actually move more quickly? On McKinsey’s partnership approach Clients demand the absolute best insight on something and not a regional insight on something. So, in some ways a global partnership model—done right—does allow the best-known method to be imported anywhere in the world. There are differences on what types of clients should we serve, what country should we be in? To make a partnership model work, you have to really invest in sharing perspectives and having honest debates, and engaging all partners on some of these decisions. You can have a delegated model that empowers people if you have strong accountability and compliance. So we have taken big steps on client selection, where we now run everything through a framework. In addition to a selection process, we’re adding professionals; we hired a new chief compliance officer. So we’re not going backward. Does it ensure that we’ll never have scrutiny in the future? I can’t say, but I do feel it’s a firm that continues to evolve. On what he’s learned over his 27-year McKinsey career I think the biggest thing for me as I think about different chapters is a notion of how do you pivot from being obsessed with proving yourself to improving yourself? It’s maybe less a function of what’s going to be good for my evaluation or promotion, and more, what do I want to do as a professional? One of the biggest pivots we can make in our own talent-development processes is pivoting from a culture that’s obsessed with evaluating people to one that’s developing people. And we’re wiring in a whole bunch of changes around that to try and get people back to [doing] what you want to do as a professional, not what people are telling you in terms of the evaluation process. On discounting tenure as an indicator of skill Internally, we have an app that we’ve built to search the firm. It can search colleagues, it can search expertise, all kinds of things. One of the first things that historically pulls up if I pulled up your profile is your name, your title and your tenure. I got rid of tenure on this. Folks were screaming: “How can you do this? It’s such a great search tool.” Part of the reason is we’re going to move away from time as an approximation for your skills, and rather be much more specific around what your skills are. So you may join us with 20 years’ experience but your tenure may say six months in the firm. That is not a good approximation for your skill. On the evolving profile of McKinsey talent Our work with our clients has really pivoted over the last 20 years. Similarly, the profiles of people joining the firm have widened enormously. [Years ago], the majority of people came straight from an M.B.A. There’s nothing wrong with that, but that’s 19 percent of our class today. The majority come from a much wider set of sources: both senior hires, technical talent. There are over 370 universities now that we recruit from. On today’s CEO agenda This is a moment, and it’s a moment unlike any other. So there’s this almost existential question of: I don’t want a board, or my predecessor, or the press, looking back and saying, how did that person miss this? There is a real imperative, particularly for CEOs, to drive growth: How do I grow coming out of this pandemic? The other aspect is, am I thinking about inclusion? This has aspects of everything from, “I just can’t find the talent that I need to do what I need to do,” to “Am I thinking comprehensively about reskilling the workforce?” The last piece I would say on the minds of everyone is climate; the notion that it can’t be the next CEO’s problem. This is my problem. Almost 75 percent of our clients have made a net-zero commitment, and I’m sure we’ll be on a path to 100 percent soon. But underneath that, they’re asking: Is my approach material enough? Is it fast enough? related Bob Sternfels: “We should accept nothing less” than sustainable and inclusive growth What’s ahead for McKinsey? A conversation with Bob Sternfels.

Three experts offer an inside look at the state of AI,McKinsey&rsquo;s 4th annual survey on the state of AI reveals best practices that can deliver outsized results.,2022-01-13T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/three%20experts%20offer%20an%20inside%20look%20at%20the%20state%20of%20ai%20in%202021/aisurvey-hero-small-people-1536x864.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/three-experts-offer-an-inside-look-at-the-state-of-ai,"Three experts offer an inside look at the state of AI Liz Grennan,  McKinsey expert associate partner; Michael Chui, MGI partner; Kia Javanmardian, McKinsey senior partner January 13, 2022 The results from McKinsey’s most recent survey on the state of AI are in. Conducted during a year of pandemic, it covered some 1,800 respondents from across a range of industries around the globe. According to our findings, the adoption of AI continues to build; a full embrace of best practices is critical to high performance; and risk management remains complicated and challenging.  It’s the 4th year we’ve run the survey, and the first time MLOps (short for machine-learning operations, the term refers to best practices for the commercial use of AI) and cloud technologies emerged as critical differentiators. Below, three of our experts share an inside look at the research: Michael Chui talks about the latest AI trends, Liz Grennan walks us through the complex world of AI and risk, and Kia Javanmardian explores MLOps, one of the industry's hottest topics. Michael Chui , partner What stood out for you in the findings? The companies that are deriving the most benefits from AI are professionalizing or industrializing their capabilities. These high performers can attribute the greatest percentage of their profits to their use of AI. They weren’t necessarily spending more, but their project costs tended to stay in budget. Indeed, other companies were far more likely to have AI costs overruns. The findings revealed that AI high performers follow many of the best practices. Is it an all-or-nothing scenario? No, but the benefits are multiplicative; best practices do interlock in their benefits. High performers have adopted MLOps, a set of practices and component tools (analogous to DevOps in software development/deployment) that have emerged over the past few years. When you put them together, they allow you to do things like train, deploy, and test models many times faster than when AI is approached as a craft. When you automate and industrialize these processes, you can repeatedly and predictably achieve significant returns in your AI investments. According to the research, cloud is a key enabler for MLOps. Why is that so? First, native to cloud environments are off-the-shelf tools, libraries, and frameworks that can speed up the AI model-development life cycle. Cloud also provides flexibility to ramp compute up and down as needed, which is especially useful for retraining models when necessary. Together, these survey findings indicate that the combination of MLOps, cloud, and applying other best practices provide a good foundation for capturing AI value at scale. The state of AI in 2021 Liz Grennan , expert associate partner How did risk and AI factor into the latest findings? The highest performers are also those who are addressing risk management in AI.  One worrisome finding is that cybersecurity continues to fall on the list of concerns. There’s no set cyber standard across organizations. It underscores, for me, the need for every organization to come up with its own framework, which isn’t easy. We see three risk categories: cyber, data, and AI. They’re all completely interdependent and require an integrated risk model. What are some of the consequences of poor AI risk management? One of the worst things is that it can perpetuate systematic discrimination and unfairness. Specifically, this can mean women not getting hired due to biased training data. People of color being denied employment, loan consideration, housing, and other benefits because the data is biased. In one pandemic-era example, certain students unable to sit for exams were excluded from university simply because they came from a historically poorly performing high school, despite their own excellent personal records.  The algorithm generating proxy test scores was inherently biased. Without AI risk management, unfairness can become endemic in organizations and can be further shrouded by the complexity. How does a company start with an AI risk management program? The easiest, and maybe the highest and best place to start, is to establish a set of ethical values you want for your business and then sort through how to operationalize those values into a framework and determine a lens through which you will start evaluating risk. Thematically, fairness and privacy are two highly important values, in addition to security, explainability and transparency, model performance, and safety. And it’s important to understand the regulations that are in place for the applicable industry and geography. How does AI risk relate to cyber risk? A complex AI system is the perfect target. And the more scaled up the AI, the bigger the threat. A bad actor can inflict damage if they break down the model and insert bad, faulty, or incorrect data, impacting large numbers of people in very personal, profound ways. What makes you optimistic? I work with an organization that aspires to be a global leader on human rights issues because they are ‘conscience first.’ They’ll state a values-driven aspiration and then they’ll weigh it for feasibility, costs, and other relevant business drivers.  They want their values to be a market differentiator—it’s that sort of position that makes me optimistic. Kia Javanmardian , senior partner Why is MLOps becoming critical to AI implementations? We have been using the car-factory analogy and it holds up pretty well: MLOps is the factory you build to scale your analytics. There are a few big picture concepts. A first step is to shift some of what you spend on R&D and pilots to building the infrastructure that will allow you to mass produce and scale your AI projects. You also need to be monitoring the data your models are using—to stick with the car analogy, a gas gauge or dashboard—so that you can track the quality of the data going in and out of your models and their level of performance. Third, if you are building every car from scratch, down to the door handle, it’s going take you an awful lot of time and energy to build each car. So, where does MLOps fit in? It’s based on the concept of building a library of standard parts or code. Your data scientists will go from creating models to spending a good chunk of their time assetizing them, converting them into reusable Lego-like parts. Finally, you don’t have the people who designed the car, your best engineers, assembling the car and maintaining it. Instead they focus on what it takes to get the horsepower in the engine to go from 400 to 800 today. How widespread is MLOps? Digital natives like Google and Amazon have been practicing MLOps for years to build their products. Very few non-digital natives are using it at scale. What do people think when they hear about it? Managers get the problem, but they can be overwhelmed with the solution. It’s very technical, involving a data infrastructure, governance, risk practices, and systems. It’s about organizational change, talent mix, evolving roles. It can be overwhelming. But the companies that are practicing MLOps are getting orders-of-magnitude higher returns for the same relative AI investment. related Flying across the sea, propelled by AI McKinsey named a “Leader” in AI Our own digital journey: Upskilling hundreds of McKinsey technologists in AI Never miss a story"
McKinsey and the ILO: Helping governments support small businesses in developing economies,"We&rsquo;ve teamed up with the UN&rsquo;s International Labour Organization to create a framework that helps governments build small-business resilience, especially in response to crises, in developing economies.",2022-01-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20were%20partnering%20with%20the%20international%20labour%20organization%20to%20help%20small%20businesses%20navigate%20crises%20and%20build%20resilience/ilo-hero-small-539282343-1536x864.jpg,"Resilience,Inclusive Growth",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/partnering-with-the-international-labour-organization-to-help-small-businesses-in-developing-economies,"McKinsey and the ILO: Helping governments support small businesses in developing economies January 14, 2022 It’s been said that small businesses form the backbone of the global economy. They provide more than 70 percent of jobs worldwide and contribute to more than 50 percent of developing countries’ GDPs , according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), a UN agency that brings together governments, employers, and workers to set labor standards and develop policies to promote social justice. But as COVID-19 continues to remind us, small businesses are also more vulnerable to crises and unexpected shocks. That’s especially true for those in developing countries. Recognizing this challenge, McKinsey has supported the ILO in creating a comprehensive framework of initiatives that can help small firms in developing countries navigate crises and build resilience. The framework offers guidance on a number of challenges that small businesses may face, including liquidity bolstering mechanisms, ways to preserve employment and support an organization’s day-to-day operations, and more. “Financial support measures are not always available to governments of developing countries,” says Tarek Rida , a McKinsey partner based in Dubai. “But they are also not the only way governments can help. In response to COVID-19, many developing country governments came up with innovative operating levers, from helping small businesses embrace e-commerce , to striking deals with small hotels to host people in need of quarantine.” As Tarek points out, there are multiple examples of these measures throughout the developing world. Many of them were created to support countries in their response to COVID-19—and were built on learnings from past crises, such as the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the Ebola epidemics, and the Haiti earthquakes. Beyond highlighting the measures themselves, the new framework also strives to shed light on how good implementation can significantly impact initiatives’ success. “While many measures can help alleviate the impact of crises on small firms, there is no one-size-fits-all solution,” says Nina Probst , a partner based in Geneva. “Each government would ultimately define and tailor their support in the way that best suits their local realities. And they would often benefit from engaging a broader ecosystem, from NGOs and donors, to employer organizations and supply chain leaders to amplify their impact.” Dragan Radîc , head of the ILO’s Small and Medium Enterprises unit, says: “The strategic role of governments in coordinating support is considered here within an integrated approach of broader ecosystems. This helps both complement resources and tailor and deploy measures that are the right fit to small firm specificities.” This framework should be useful to any government aiming to help their grassroots economies grow in the most effective, sustainable, and inclusive manner. Crises do not impact small businesses in the same way, nor are they all equally equipped to respond. “For example, informal firms employ more than 60 percent of people worldwide, especially in developing countries. And they are a particularly vulnerable, and difficult to reach group,” says Corina Stoenescu , an engagement manager based in Geneva, who co-led the effort. “Informal firms, women entrepreneurs, young firm owners, people with disabilities and multiple other, often country-specific groups, may need to be addressed through special measures, for the support to be truly equitable,” she adds. Beyond crisis-response approaches, the framework also includes measures that can help small organizations build resilience ahead of future challenges by enhancing their risk-management capabilities. And many of the measures proposed can also be a starting point for the sustainable transformations of small firms, whether through increased use of technology or opportunities to transition to more environmentally friendly operations, facilitating a step forward in countries’ economic and social development. “This work comes at a time when many countries are still struggling with the effects of the pandemic, while at the same time trying to derive learnings that will help them navigate future crises,” says Nina. “This framework should be useful to any government aiming to help their grassroots economies grow in the most effective, sustainable, and inclusive manner.” related Partnering with UNESCO to help school systems respond to COVID-19 Never miss a story"

January 20, 2022 In 2019, QuantumBlack , our AI firm, launched Kedro, its first open-source software tool for data scientists and data engineers. It’s a library of code that can be used to create data and machine-learning pipelines, the building blocks of any analytics project. In the two-and-a-half years it has been available on the open-source platform GitHub, the Kedro community and user base continues to grow, with more than 200,000 monthly downloads, over 100 contributors, and a growing number of enterprises that choose Kedro as their standard for data-science code. For example, a team at NASA used Kedro to model air-traffic patterns and Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest wireless network provider, uses Kedro as a standard across their data science organization. Today, we are taking the next step in our open-source journey and donating Kedro to the Linux Foundation. It will be hosted by LF AI & Data , a specialist Linux Foundation umbrella organization founded in 2018 to accelerate development and innovation in AI and data by supporting and connecting technical open-source projects, developer communities, and some 1000 companies. “We’re excited to welcome the Kedro project into LF AI & Data,” says Dr. Ibrahim Haddad, executive director of LF AI & Data. “It addresses the many challenges that exist in creating machine-learning products today, and it is a fantastic complement to our portfolio of hosted technical projects. We look forward to working with the community to grow the project’s footprint and to create new collaboration opportunities with our members, hosted projects, and the larger open-source community.” Kedro is now in the hands of the data-science ecosystem. “This is the only way it can grow at this point; if it is improved by people around the world,” explains Yetunde Dada , the Kedro product lead. “Our cross-disciplinary team gets to see the increased development and validation of Kedro with this milestone. It establishes Kedro as a de-facto industry tool, joining a collection of other cutting-edge open-source projects such as Kubernetes donated by Google, GraphQL by Facebook, and MLFlow and Delta Lake by Databricks.” Donating our intellectual property is new ground for McKinsey. But according to McKinsey senior partners and QuantumBlack co-leaders Alex Singla and Alex Sukharevsky , the move expresses our firm’s passion for developing innovative products, particularly in the field of AI, that help create sustainable and inclusive growth for our clients and society. It also represents our move from the age of experimentation into scaling AI solutions. Jeremy Palmer , a McKinsey senior partner and co-leader of QuantumBlack Labs , the home of products like Kedro within the firm, agrees. “It makes sense to be sharing a tool which can become an industry standard, since the whole open-source community can now contribute to its improvement,” he says. “We will all learn more, and faster, and hence stay at the forefront of useful innovation.” So what qualifies Kedro as a de-facto “industry standard?” Ivan Danov, the Kedro technical lead, explains: “Kedro is a framework that borrows concepts from software-engineering best practices and brings them to the data-science world. It lays all the groundwork for taking a project from an idea to a finished product, allowing developers and engineers to focus entirely on solving the business problem at hand. Kedro is built to be the backbone of all machine-learning projects.” Kedro will continue to be the foundation of all advanced analytics projects within McKinsey. “We’ve been building machine learning products for a long time and have accrued a fair amount of scar tissue and learned a lot of important lessons,”  says Joel Schwarzmann , Kedro product manager. “The ideas and guardrails that exist in Kedro reflect that experience and are designed to help developers avoid common pitfalls and follow best practices.” Now its future can be steered by a much wider range of stakeholders, across different industries, geographies and technologies, who bring different perspectives, and can apply Kedro to many more use cases. An extended team of “maintainers,” including McKinsey’s own developers, can contribute to Kedro’s development: writing code, shaping product strategies, tracking use cases, and voting on decisions that affect the project. McKinsey has gone from being a Kedro owner to a Kedro user, and in so doing, created a pathway for firm innovation that is seeing us create and move products to the open-source world, where they can help solve problems for anyone. QuantumBlack is currently developing more open-source products.

He and his partners Daniel Schay and Aron Antal are all McKinsey alumni, and they bring their team of 60+ experts—along with their transformative powers in software engineering, digital expertise, and business building—to McKinsey Digital this month. They will form the core of a new studio in Budapest, fast becoming a center of technology innovation in Europe, and focus on helping clients with their digital transformations. It will be our fourth McKinsey Digital studio in Europe, in addition to London, Berlin, and Stockholm, encompassing 500+ digital, technology, design, and analytics experts across the continent. Businesses have been digitizing for over a decade, but COVID-19 has acted as an accelerant, spurring five to ten years of digital adoption across a matter of months. Incremental transformations are no longer enough; companies have to make fundamental changes to how they work, and technologies such as cloud, AI, and blockchain are advancing so quickly that any digitization initiative is becoming much more complex. The acquisition further deepens our technical delivery capabilities, along with our recent acquisitions of Candid for cloud and Hypothesis for software engineering and Agile. “With IncepTech’s technology leadership and deep engineering skills,” says Paul Jenkins , a senior partner and head of McKinsey Digital in Europe, “we can significantly grow what we are already doing: mobilizing small, highly-skilled teams to help clients build digital products, channels, and businesses.” The Budapest studio aims to grow significantly from IncepTech’s base by recruiting some of the leading engineers and digital consultants from across Europe. “In our studios, which are McKinsey Digital expert communities, cross-functional teams help clients solve their hardest, make-or-break challenges, often on very tight timelines, working in a fast and agile way,” explains Chris Smith , a McKinsey partner in London who helps lead the McKinsey Digital studio network in Europe. According to Chris, teams also create new tools; build accelerators, such as the digital skeleton of a retail outlet or a branch bank; and work side-by-side with clients to develop in-house capabilities. McKinsey has collaborated with IncepTech on projects such as helping a fast-growing real estate agency build a digital-service ecosystem to significantly increase earnings; and working with a leading expedition cruise company to develop their digital distribution platforms for travel agents and customers. “We share a similar commitment to our clients and an urgency to deliver value,” says Chris. “Our teams will be 100 percent integrated from the start, and our IncepTech colleagues, by joining McKinsey, will have the opportunity to work on some of the most intriguing digital challenges today.” We share a similar commitment to our clients and an urgency to deliver value. Another trait McKinsey and IncepTech share is a focus on people. “IncepTech develops early-tenure people into very high-caliber engineering experts and digital consultants within a relatively short time,” says Chris. “That’s unique in the market and hard to do—and very much the way we work.” “When we first started our firm,” says Gyorgy, “we wanted to create a culture that merged the worlds of technology and business. It’s not just consultants and engineers who work together—but engineers who want to be digital business leaders, and business consultants who love this world of technology, and want to understand the inner workings of all things.” To learn more about McKinsey Digital or our Digital Studios, please contact us here . related McKinsey acquires Candid Partners, a leader in cloud consulting McKinsey accelerates digital delivery capabilities in Australia Never miss a story"

Built by Facebook with help from Google, the cables could boost data capacity to southeast Asia’s largest economy by 70 percent. The project, which is still subject to government approval, would be a boon to Indonesia’s connected users, who are among the savviest in the region and beyond.

Today, the nation comprises the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in the world. Indonesians buying and selling goods and services online account for some $32 billion annually, forming a sector that has emerged as a major driver of local manufacturing and jobs. Telkomsel has been an engine of that growth. The world’s seventh-largest mobile operator and the largest in Southeast Asia, the mobile-communications provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable, inclusive digital economy for Indonesia’s nearly 200 million internet users. It has dramatically increased Indonesia’s broadband access, helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) digitize, and led the nation’s transition from 3G to 4G before becoming the first operator to launch 5G there in May 2021. Telkomsel has long recognized the value of continuous innovation. When it looked to ensure its platform would remain the primary way its customers engage with the world—and win a new generation of customers—the 26-year-old incumbent decided to embark on a big, bold transformation. A plan to transform The move wouldn’t be easy, but Telkomsel felt it had an obligation to its customers, who had come to rely on the provider’s ability to meet their digital demands. So the organization called on a cross-functional team of data-domain experts from QuantumBlack and venture builders, designers, and strategy consultants from Leap by McKinsey to initiate a large-scale digital program aimed at reinventing the way customers experience Telkomsel in daily life. As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel knew it had to engage and strengthen its relevance with Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer segment. The average data-hungry Gen Z consumer in Indonesia spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone, using it to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. The program was built on three core pillars. Telkomsel wanted to build a new data analytics platform to better understand its customers and drive personalization; create and launch new businesses to reach underserved consumers; and launch a new digital channel that would streamline and simplify the way customers engage with Telkomsel’s services. Understanding customers Telkomsel’s leaders knew that providing customers with the best products and services would require putting data to smart use. The company developed new analytics capabilities that allowed it to enhance customers’ experiences and start the journey toward hyper-personalizing its services. Telkomsel began by building a new platform that contains more than 9,000 data points for each consumer, which was fully modular and reusable across business units. This gave the company a single, near-real-time view of customer behavior that could be used to improve experience across the entire consumer journey, from marketing and customer service to network operations, back-office support, and more. The platform was supplemented by AI-driven tools to help better understand consumers’ needs and priorities across thousands of customer microsegments. They also moved from manual data uploads to automated data pipelines and quality checks, which improved data quality and speed, and enabled more accurate and faster decision-making.

Every month, Telkomsel runs more than 50 analytical models, based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, to identify the right way to interact with their customers and offer them propositions that are most relevant to them. The move toward hyper-personalization has allowed Telkomsel to better tailor their offers for customers. Today, these services and offerings already account for 50 percent of the telco’s overall revenues. Creating value beyond the hype Launching new businesses As it laid its analytics foundation, Telkomsel moved to engage and strengthen its relevance with new consumer segments. For instance, the company needed to enhance its relevance to those underserved by traditional home broadband infrastructure. They also wanted to reach Indonesia’s Gen Z, the country’s second-largest consumer audience, which spends 8.5 hours a day on their phone to digitally meet various lifestyle needs. In order to move at their desired speed, Telkomsel would need to launch new brands and value propositions, which would require them to embrace a different culture, agile ways of working, and a fit-for-purpose technological stack through new business-building. In the end, they launched two new brands. Orbit: Expanding connectivity for underserved segments Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. Even as Indonesia rapidly digitized, fixed broadband access was not uniform, with just 15 percent of households using it to get online. To provide wireless connectivity to those who lacked fixed broadband, Telkomsel built and launched a new business called Orbit, which provides customers with a home router that uses 4G mobile cellular services instead of fiber optics. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Orbit offers data packages without long-term subscriptions, creating more economic flexibility. It includes a mobile app to check usage, top up on data, and manage router settings, such as parental controls. Orbit has doubled its one-year customer acquisition goal, with more than 35 percent of customers joining from its referral program, a testament to its popularity and market demand. Today, Orbit is seeing 20 percent month-over-month growth. By.U: Reaching Generation Z Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. Telkomsel didn’t have the kind of brand association among the digital natives it wanted to serve and delight. A cross-functional team of product managers, customer design experts and venture builders developed, built, and launched by.U, an all-digital telco experience. The platform allows users to select a pre-paid SIM card that arrives at their doorstep, activate their number remotely, manage top-ups and quotas, make payments, and more. By.U was built at pace. The team created a series of social-media tests to observe click-through rates on certain features, which allowed the team to develop and tune the minimum-viable product quickly. When Telkomsel beta-launched the brand, they quickly had 30,000 customers join the waitlist. The brand reached its one-year customer acquisition goal in half that time. Fifteen months after launch, by.U had nearly 2 million subscribers, was delivering increased customer satisfaction, and had a market-leading net-promotor score. And to help ensure innovation continued post-launch, the by.U team established an agile-organization structure. Simplifying and enhancing engagement The app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. The goal of Telkomsel’s third pillar could be simply stated: to make customers’ interactions with the company as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible. But it was complicated to achieve. Telkomsel already had a self-serve mobile app, and the team initially set out to make changes there to improve the customer journey. However, as customer expectations for what an app could do rose—digital payments and loyalty programs, for example—so did pressure on the app’s infrastructure. It soon became clear that there was more value to be had in starting fresh. Delivering a new app is always complex. In this case, a core technology transition to a micro-services-based architecture proved to be the unlock. It also meant shaping a rigorous product-development strategy and creating a new commercial strategy to encourage uptake. But it was all worth it. With the launch of the award-winning MyTelkomsel, the company was able to offer customers more transparency around their usage, going from SMS-triggered alerts to an immediate, real-time view, as well as provide personalized packages tailored to their needs. Customer experience around digital payments became seamless, while an ecosystem with digital-retail partners let Telkomsel customers redeem loyalty points for products. Elsewhere, gamification mechanics allowed customers to earn badges that qualified them for free data allowances. The app also enabled access to new digital services, including video and gaming, and easier access to e-payment options through services like LinkAja, GoPay, OVO, Dana, and ShopeePay. All of this meant serving customers in more dynamic, exciting, and tailored ways. Today the app has 24 million monthly active users (MAU), a tenfold increase over the previous app. All aboard: Recruiting digital talent to sustain innovation Telkomsel knew that technology was only one part of the transformation equation. Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform—no matter how powerful—would perform to potential or withstand technological evolution. They also saw the potential in this partnership to help cultivate digital skills in Indonesia’s workforce, strengthening a commitment to building a center of excellence for Indonesian digital talent. They launched a new, agile recruitment process to attract, onboard, and train 40+ of Indonesia’s strong digital talent across data science, software engineering, product ownership and UX design. This entailed a whole new talent management approach – reinventing employer branding, carving out career paths for new profiles like data engineers and translators, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling existing analytics professionals. Over the course of several months, Telkomsel hired candidates across 12 newly created digital and data analytics roles, and set up seven cross-functional agile squads to catalyze the adoption of new ways of working. The end-product was a data management platform and new businesses - made in Indonesia, for Indonesians, by Indonesians. Culture, capabilities, and resilience Inside the company, its most enduring returns may also be among its least tangible: An emerging culture of innovation and agility; new capabilities and competencies; a new confidence in taking bold leaps through new ventures; and a commitment to long-term, sustainable transformation. Such traits, for example, enabled Telkomsel to help its customers through COVID-19. They quickly ensured their customers had fully-remote, digital services at their fingertips, and they were able to offer new packages that were tailored to what their customers needed and could afford at any given time. The telco industry is essential to our modern economies, enabling nearly every facet of remote connectivity, from online meetings to e-commerce to telehealth. It’s a sector in which it can feel like there’s little room for failure—and perhaps not always enough room for innovation. Telkomsel’s story is proof that innovation is not just valuable but critical; and that it can pay off when an organization commits to transformation at every level. Its digital journey has touched the lives of hundreds of millions of Indonesians, through personalization at-scale to enhance the experience of all its customers, new brands tailored to its digital-first users, and a new app that adds convenience to customers’ daily lives.

McKinsey partner named a &ldquo;Notable Black Leader&rdquo; by Crain&rsquo;s New York,"In this conversation, Shelley Stewart III, director of the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, speaks with his father about driving change and empowering Black professionals across two generations.",2022-02-25T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20partner%20named%20a%20notable%20black%20leader%20by%20crains%20new%20york/shelleycrains-hero-small-shelley-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Diversity",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-partner-named-a-notable-black-leader-by-crains-new-york,"McKinsey partner named a “Notable Black Leader” by Crain’s New York February 25, 2022 “Economic empowerment for Black Americans is at the core of sustainable and inclusive growth,” says Shelley Stewart III. “If you can solve it for Black Americans, then you’ve got seeds of the solution for all Americans who are living close to the poverty line, because Black Americans are disproportionately the poorest from an income and wealth perspective, and they suffer from very limited economic mobility.” A partner in our Marketing and Sales and Private Equity Practices who founded and directs the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility , Shelley has just been recognized for his work on this front. On February 21, Crain’s New York Business named him to the publication’s 2022 list of Notable Black Leaders . “I am honored to be recognized alongside so many accomplished professionals,” he says. “For nearly two decades, I’ve considered New York City my home, and I’m grateful to the social and professional excellence taking place in the city of dreams.” Fighting for racial equity in the workplace is something of a family tradition for the Stewarts. Shelley’s grandfather was a machinist and union official who championed equal rights in 1960s corporate America and fought for the desegregation of schools on Long Island. His mother Ann, who holds a BA in criminal justice and an MPA, had a successful career working for the State of Connecticut as a lead on the Alternative Dispute Resolution Program. And Shelley Stewart Jr. is an accomplished corporate executive and board member who served as E.I. du Pont Nemours and Company’s chief procurement officer from 2012 to 2016 and currently sits on the boards of Kontoor Brands and the Otis Worldwide Corporation. The Stewarts recently endowed the Stewart Professor of Criminal Justice and Community Policing at the University of New Haven, and in October 2021, Shelley Jr. was named one of America’s Most Influential Black Corporate Directors by Savoy . [Note: In the short films here, Shelley and his father, Shelley Stewart Jr., talk about Black leadership in the workplace across two generations.] These role models helped steer Shelley’s passion. “I absolutely saw this level of determination from both of my parents, who went to work every day and had to deal with all sorts of things that folks who are Black have to deal with,” says Shelley. “I was party to conversations at the dinner table about it. The spirit was never complaining. It was more about understanding the reality of the situation that we’re in and recognizing that as you progress you also have an obligation to bring more people through the door.” Crain’s created the 2022 list to “identify talented and accomplished Black individuals” who “invigorate the New York business community every day.” Shelley has spent his career in the city. He worked on Wall Street in investment banking for J.P Morgan before leaving to co-found and lead portfolio management for Dreadnought Capital Management, a New York impact-investment firm that focused on providing debt capital to social-impact borrowers. In its first two years, the firm completed more than $300 million in impact-driven transactions, which included the support of affordable housing developments. Shelley joined McKinsey in 2012, where he has realized an opportunity to utilize the firm’s platform and resources to continue his work on racial equity. Today, that includes authoring flagship McKinsey research, such as A $300 billion opportunity: Serving the emerging Black American consumer , that highlights the social and economic benefits to be unlocked through inclusive economic growth. In a February article published in AdAge , Shelley summed up the thesis of that work: “There is an estimated $300 billion already in play today—$260 billion in reallocated spending and $40 billion in new consumption—from better serving Black consumers,” he wrote. “The latest research from the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, which included a survey of almost 3,500 respondents, makes the case that serving Black consumers better would deliver both social and economic benefits—to the United States as a whole, and to individual companies.” Insights like that, Shelley explains, can help leaders pursue the kinds of efforts that will meaningfully improve Black economic mobility. “I’m optimistic,” he says. “It’s just about looking at the numbers and saying, ‘ We live in a country where the ethos is all about having the opportunity to rise economically. But the fact of the matter is that has not been the reality for tens of millions of Black Americans. ’ And we can call it woke, or just call it facts, but we need to begin to talk about it and actually make those opportunities a reality for everyone. That is how we will change things.” related Introducing the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility Year one: Lessons from our new think tank focused on Black lives Never miss a story"

The open ecosystem today comprises more than 500 external-organization members and more than 20 acquired companies. According to Peter, it allows us to seamlessly collaborate with cutting-edge technology providers, leading platforms, system integrators, and implementation experts to bring even greater end-to-end impact to organizations at the front lines of change. “McKinsey’s open ecosystem of alliances and acquisitions provides an unparalleled offering, and it is one important ingredient in our ability to partner with our clients for end-to-end impact,” says Peter . “The impact our ecosystem has generated is already compelling—and we are accelerating our journey.” For example, we worked with AWS to help a global pizza company develop an e-commerce platform and establish a digital team that increased customer conversion by 40 percent, customer satisfaction by 15 percent, and reduced downtime to zero. We partnered with Google Cloud to help one of our global logistics clients increase their supply-chain forecasting accuracy by building an advanced analytics platform to better predict order volumes. By utilizing Microsoft’s IoT platform, we helped a wireless equipment manufacturer build a “factory of the future,” delivering a use-case strategy, roadmap, and industrial IoT platform in 16 weeks. And working with SAP, we helped a multinational consumer-packaged goods organization transform their supply chain through tech-enabled autonomous planning. The program reduced inventory by 27 percent, and manual work by 60 percent, by consolidating over 100 data sources into one. It also increased the forecast accuracy by six to ten percent and reaction speed by 400 percent. Ecosystem of Alliances and Acquisitions Those are just a few cases that illustrate what our collaborations can do. In addition, we work with hundreds of collaborators who bring specific and relevant capabilities across every industry and function where we serve clients. Meanwhile, we’re also active in the acquisition space, seeking out strategic, high-caliber organizations that rapidly bolster our internal capabilities, accelerate our pace of innovation, and scale the value and impact we create for clients Our most recent acquisitions include Candid , a leader in cloud consulting that has enabled us to rapidly scale our technical capabilities and accelerate the rate at which we help our clients capture concrete business value from cloud adoption. Candid helps McKinsey clients end-to-end: developing initial strategies and business cases through to designing architecture, migrating applications, and optimizing workloads. Vivid Economics , a strategic economics consultancy with broad sustainability and macroeconomic capabilities, also recently joined McKinsey. Today, the Vivid team helps our clients navigate the urgent implications of climate change and transform towards net-zero carbon emissions. This includes assessing climate and nature-related risk; developing environmentally and socially sustainable strategies; and creating value through sustainable transformations. The impact our ecosystem has generated is already compelling—and we’re only just starting our journey. And Orpheus , an innovator in digital procurement and spend analytics , means McKinsey can now unlock the value hidden in clients’ purchasing data. It combines an advanced platform technology with McKinsey’s industry expertise and content-rich services in digital procurement to offer clients a software as a service (SaaS) product that provides solutions that suit their specific requirements. “By combining our own capabilities with those of our alliances and acquisition partners,” says Liz, “we know that the expertise we are bringing to clients—whether it’s large-scale data transformations, the latest in technology solutions, or paving the way for a net-zero future—leads to greater impact.” related McKinsey acquires Material Economics, experts in sustainability and circularity McKinsey acquires Candid Partners, a leader in cloud consulting McKinsey acquires Vivid Economics and Planetrics to help clients navigate climate change Never miss a story"
How sponsorship can help women in tech advance,McKinsey Digital&rsquo;s Gayatri Shenai and Devon Chen share their stories and explore a key workplace element for helping women advance in technology careers: sponsorship.,2022-03-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/putting%20women%20at%20the%20forefront%20of%20technology/intlwomensday-hero-small-1055846650-1536x864.jpg,"Digital,Diversity",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/putting-women-at-the-forefront-of-technology,"How sponsorship can help women in tech advance March 8, 2022 When Gayatri Shenai was a new partner in McKinsey Digital , she faced some tough questions about her qualifications in a meeting with a CEO. She was there as a subject-matter expert, and the CEO grilled her about her knowledge and experience. Eventually, one of Gayatri’s senior partner colleagues, who knew the CEO for decades, stepped in. “He interrupted the CEO and said, ‘Look, she’s amazing, she’ll do a great job, you need to trust me that she knows what she is doing,’” says Gayatri . “That moment of sponsorship changed my destiny.” Gayatri went on to work with the CEO in a long and successful relationship. But that early moment underscores how important it was to have sponsors guiding her career. While women earn about half of science and engineering degrees , they make up less than 20 percent of people employed in these fields. And for many who choose this career path, they are commonly the only person of their gender in a room. This International Women’s Day, we’re looking at one workplace element that can help reverse those trends for women in tech : connecting with a sponsor who creates opportunities for them and advocates for their advancement. Choosing and working with sponsors Expert associate partner Devon Chen has worked with several sponsors throughout her McKinsey career, and she’s now in a place to sponsor others. She says that a successful sponsorship is all about personal chemistry. “The relationship has to be inherently genuine,” she says. “It helps to build a trust-based relationship through working together or establishing a friendship over time.” This has been the case for Gayatri, who has now worked with one of her sponsors for 13 years. “He has seen my whole journey,” she says. “He’s seen the difference and growth in me, and he can coach me in a way that matches my personality.” Sponsors are different than mentors. While one person can fill both roles, Gayatri and Devon say it’s important that a sponsor understands that their role is to not only offer advice, as a mentor would, but also to advocate for opportunities and shepherd someone in early tenure toward their goals. Repairing the broken rung on the career ladder for women in technical roles Devon’s experience with both sides of sponsorship has taught her the importance of such clarity. “Overcommunicate your support and intentions,” she says. “I very directly tell people I’m sponsoring, ‘I’m in your corner. Ask me for help when you think you might need it. I’m going to offer you advice when I think you might want it.’” She also suggests setting up regular touch points, such as a monthly call to check in. In her experience, a good sponsor helps colleagues take the steps needed to progress toward their next role. This means identifying and letting them know of opportunities as they come up; connecting them to specialists in those roles; outlining skills and training that may be needed; and coaching them on building their profile externally and internally . For instance, when Devon was making a non-traditional career move from data scientist to team lead, a couple of key McKinsey sponsors encouraged and helped her by being honest about challenges she might face. They particularly recommended she develop her project and team management skills, which they helped her achieve. “They didn’t let the fact that there wasn’t a precedent for this kind of lane change stop them from always asking ‘why not?’” Devon says. Encouraging women to speak up For women in tech to benefit from sponsorship, according to Gayatri and Devon, they must put themselves forward to start a relationship and be vocal about their needs and ambitions. This can be challenging for women who may not have always been in environments where this was encouraged—or welcomed. “Many of the women I’ve worked with have been reticent to reach out and ask for my time and advice,” senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director Kweilin Ellingrud has said . “As opposed to men I’ve worked with­­­—or even some I haven’t work with—who aren’t shy to come to me and ask. Young women should keep in mind that those around them want them to take up space and want to help.” There’s no reason women can’t be at the forefront of the sector that’s changing the world. Gayatri’s advice for women in tech? Stay in tech. She sees too many women leave the sector because they feel alone in the field. “Tech holds a disproportionate share of impact, opportunities, benefits. It will shape economic growth. We Need a diversity of perspectives,” says Gayatri. “There’s no reason women can’t be at the forefront of the sector that’s changing the world.” related A McKinsey leader unites women in tech to prepare for the future of work Women in STEM, episode 3: Mentorship and sponsorship Never miss a story"

Sixty-seven stories of extraordinary leadership. March 11, 2022 CEO Excellence , McKinsey’s new book detailing the six mindsets of extraordinary leaders, is written for anyone who wants to inspire others and lead change within an organization. It’s a book of stories shared by 67 extraordinary leaders about the most important moments and insights from their own experiences running major businesses and organizations around the world. It recounts times of public glory and personal failure, moments of epiphany, once-in-a-lifetime events, and the grinding daily work of leading complex organizations.  Most importantly, it shares the thinking and behaviors top leaders have personally developed to thrive. These insights, a sample of which are excerpted below, go beyond the C-suite, and they can shape the way we confront everyday situations where we’re asked to lead—at work, at home, and in our communities. Don ’ t surround yourself with “yes” people. One of a CEO’s first tasks is to carefully shape their top teams—and they differ in what they seek. After confirming expertise and proven experience, some leaders look for emotional intelligence, while others value passion, or the ability to balance the short and long term. One thing most CEOs agree on?  Do not surround yourself with people who are afraid to disagree with you. Sony’s Kazuo Hirai describes his approach to selecting a management team. “What I basically looked for was expertise and proven ability in [an area]…the TV business, digital imaging, the movie business, PlayStation…” On top of aptitude, he looked for attitude: “…a demonstrated ability to push back against their bosses and not be afraid to present their ideas and be bold about it.” To many people, teamwork means getting along, but to Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, “…the best team player is the one who puts up their hand and says, ‘ I don ’ t agree, because I don ’ t think [this] is in the best interest of the client or the company. ’ ” Time management? It’s about the moment. Being a CEO means being subject to a crushing schedule; everyone has his or her own time management approach: color-coding calendar entries; listing quarterly priorities; safeguarding chunks of free time for last-minute emergencies; intensive delegation to teams. In fact, CEO time management is one of the most-read-about topics in business journalism today. But even the most calibrated time-management techniques won’t work without the right mindset: the ability to compartmentalize and focus on the moment. It’s vital to high performance and one of the most challenging aspects of the job from an emotional perspective. As Galderma’s Flemming Ornskov advises, “When you’re there, [be]…there in body and mind.” US Bancorp’s Richard Davis says, “[It’s] essential. If you bring every burden to every meeting…the day [will] start to pile up on you…You just have to take everything as it is and isolate it, manage it; isolate it, manage it...People [will] start seeing that you are discipline and focused.” In a storm, look beyond the horizon. Managing crises comes with the CEO role; it could be company-specific such as a product failure, or an external catastrophe, such as the pandemic. While CEO Excellence outlines protocols, such as stress tests, scenario planning, and how to set up a command center, it emphasizes that for a CEO—or indeed anyone—facing a crisis, it’s essential to keep a long-term perspective. “It doesn’t matter how difficult times are, there is always a world after a crisis. Even if the situation looks bleak, believe in yourself and your people and maintain a positive attitude,” counsels Herbert Hainer, CEO of Adidas from 2000-2016. ""Don’t let yourself or the company be influenced too much by uncontrollable circumstances.”
The company’s current CEO Kasper Rorsted, points out: “…a crisis [can] actually be the best time to make radical change…you can be dogmatic and say, ‘ We’re not going to do this anymore’ whether it’s cutting unnecessary travel, leveraging digital channels, or anything else. It’s a time to move two or three years ahead of where you would have been otherwise.” A longer-term view can also help a leader sidestep tempting short-term solutions that ultimately may be harmful.  When hit by a recession, Eaton’s Sandy Cutler didn’t want to resort to layoffs, noting, “When we grow again, we’re going to need the skills of all of these people.” Be the energy you want to see. The mood of the CEO can permeate the entire organization. “My leadership mantra, which I think about literally every day, is that the role of a leader is to define reality and give hope,” says Ken Chenault of American Express. But it has to be genuine and pragmatic, or employees will see through it. Marjorie Yang of Esquel reinforces the importance of showing up with a positive attitude. “My job is to drive away fear,” she says. “Fear is the worst enemy of any business….As a leader, my job is to maintain...and radiate confidence.” Andrew Wilson of Electronic Arts believes people look to CEOs today for more than professional guidance: they look for personal, spiritual and philosophical support. It's important to show humanity to inspire people. He offers an example. During a pandemic zoom call with seven thousand employees, he paused the call to make a paper airplane for his five-year old son who had just walked into the room. “It took thirty seconds…afterward people reached out and said: ‘ Thank you. You just gave us permission to be parents…to spend the time, ’ ” he said.
“When you talk to great CEOs, the things I hear about aren't how big the company is, how high the share price is, how much money they make...” he observes. “[It ’ s] how they make their people feel. That ’ s the legacy of a great CEO.” And a leader of any kind.

McKinsey acquires team from a leading digital commerce agency: LOBO,Our first LatAm acquisition welcomes the full team from a Buenos Aires-based agency and further strengthens our digital commerce capabilities in the Americas.,2022-03-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20acquires%20team%20from%20a%20leading%20digital%20commerce%20agency%20lobo/laacq-hero-small-1321425499-1536x864.jpg,"Acquisitions,Growth, Marketing & Sales,Digital",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-acquires-team-from-a-leading-digital-commerce-agency-lobo,"McKinsey acquires team from a leading digital commerce agency: LOBO March 14, 2022 “It’s a time of high-growth for e-commerce and digital transformation in Latin America,” says Facundo Bonfigli who, along with Lucas Chimmalez , created LOBO, a boutique digital agency in Buenos Aires. Founded in 2016, the agency has grown significantly over the past six years, working across 25 industries and in 15 countries. [Note: This story is also available in Spanish .] Today, we are very pleased to announce that the full LOBO team will be joining McKinsey. They will double the size of our digital commerce and operations team in the Americas, forming the core of a new capability hub based in Buenos Aires serving clients in Latin America and North America. According to Stephan Zimmermann , a McKinsey senior partner who leads our digital marketing analytics group for the Americas, the region is experiencing a digital revolution due to “a convergence of factors that are hitting all at once—a digital-savvy population, booming smartphone penetration, fast growing tech start-ups and unicorns, and surging ecommerce growth.” The LOBO team has been delivering powerful results for both established businesses and digital-native startups by energizing their digital sales channels. For example, they helped a fragrance company increase revenue by over 1000 percent, and a medical insurer boost lead volume by 85 percent, lowering the cost-per-lead acquisition by 43 percent. McKinsey has been partnering with LOBO for three years. “LOBO brings together a great team of experts who can get on-the-ground quickly and help our clients accelerate to a world-class level of digital marketing,” observes Stephan. Specifically, Stephan says, the LOBO team knows how to help businesses target new customer segments and expand their existing relationships. Their work can identify the most effective digital channels and formats for developing personalized client acquisition and retention campaigns. They also create content that resonates with target audiences, and then can automate the engagement processes end-to-end, from sending emails to reporting results, optimizing approaches, and refining budgets. “Entire industries such as retail, banking, telecoms, and consumer products are being upended by competitors who are digital natives—at a pace that is phenomenal,” says Jesus Moreno , a McKinsey partner in Buenos Aires who is leading the acquisition. “It’s a real challenge for many companies to internally grow world-class digital marketing talent, which is usually very scarce in the market. To help them, we provide the best team with speed and scale, powered by the best analytics and tech assets.” For instance, a McKinsey team could include a data scientist from QuantumBlack , software engineers and designers from McKinsey Digital, and now marketing operations and digital sales talent from this team of experts who have joined our digital marketing operations and technology team. The acquisition will also help us ensure the impact we create for clients can be sustained over the long term. “The LOBO team will help us build capabilities and help them develop their own marketing operations teams,” says Stephan. “This is what differentiates us from other firms. We're there to help clients accelerate results while building the skills of their team so they become fully self-sufficient and realize sustainable growth.” They have execution experts that can get up and running quickly and help a customer go from zero to a hundred miles-an-hour in terms of digital sales. LOBO has built its team through a smart recruiting process that is reinforced by a collegial, flexible, and collaborative culture. Colleagues go through a rigorous program of client rotations, train on different tools, and gain exposure to a variety of industries and geographies. They experience a systematic approach to coaching and advising clients, similar to the way McKinsey trains consultants. “We hire candidates with an analytical bent from a range of backgrounds,” says Lucas. “What we look for is enthusiasm.” Now, that enthusiasm will be put to work in service of our clients. “By joining McKinsey, we can give our people the ultimate opportunity,” says Facundo. “They will be able to work on a variety of challenges and projects they might not have had otherwise, and have the chance to create new, innovative solutions.” To get in touch with our Marketing & Sales Practice, please contact us here . related McKinsey acquires IncepTech, deepening software engineering and technology capabilities in Europe McKinsey accelerates digital delivery capabilities in Australia Never miss a story"
The Mobile World Congress insights shaping our conversations with tech and telco leaders,Mobile World Congress 2022 brought people from the connectivity industry together for the first time in over two years for a look at emerging technologies and opportunities for growth.,2022-03-18T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/how%20insights%20from%20mwc%20are%20helping%20shape%20the%20future%20of%20the%20telco%20industry/mwc22-hero-small-bob-1536x864-new.jpg,Telecommunications,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-insights-from-mwc-are-helping-shape-the-future-of-the-telco-industry,"The Mobile World Congress insights shaping our conversations with tech and telco leaders Bob Sternfels, our global managing partner, spoke at the 2022 edition of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It was the first time the event was held live since 2019. March 18, 2022 Mobile World Congress (MWC), the leading event in the connectivity industry, was held live in Barcelona earlier this month. It’s a showcase for companies to launch their newest devices and experiences for business and entertainment. This year, the first time the event was held in person since 2019, participants could try out virtual time travel, a 4D metaverse roller coaster, musical sunglasses, digital tattooing, and much more. Dozens of McKinsey colleagues attended, delivering keynotes, moderating panels, and leading workshops. Bob Sternfels , our global managing partner, helped set the stage in his keynote by outlining the immense opportunities that telcos have to drive sustainable and inclusive growth, highlighting some important elements that will be needed to achieve this: collaboration, bold leadership, and innovative business models. Coming back together in-person was key, our colleagues said. “I am zoomed out,” says Tarek Elmasry , a McKinsey senior partner. “In-person meetings here are the lifeblood of what we do.” In this post, attendees reflect on what they heard and learned at the event and how these insights are informing their client conversations and plans going forward. “We can do this.” “I was so pleased—and surprised—by the tremendous confidence of telcos overall,” says Ferry Grijpink, a partner. “They met the challenges of the pandemic: the infrastructure worked, businesses accelerated their use of digital technologies at an astounding rate, and it was really clear that without telcos there would be no working from home, no e-learning, no telehealth.” “There was a very strong message of: we can do this!” he adds. Telcos also made a loud and clear commitment to sustainability, according to Ferry, not just for reducing their own carbon footprints but in positioning themselves as enablers for other industries. They presented use cases in transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. For example, in farming, drones connected to the cloud are photographing and monitoring fields to finely calibrate and reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. However, the challenge still remains for telcos to monetize their tremendous investments in 5G. According to Ferry, progress there has been slow. “For the B2C side, they need to start differentiating their products so consumers will start paying for their advanced capabilities, such as increased speed and reduced latency for gamers,” he says. “For B2B, they need to sell more than connectivity and develop business solutions through partnerships that offer added value.” The B2B opportunity B2B is an especially promising growth market, says Dr. Karolina Sauer-Sidor , a partner. The number and types of channels customers expect a business to offer has doubled in six years, from the early basics of email and phone to the procurement portals and mobile apps of today. “Operators can focus on developing next-gen connectivity products such as SD-WAN and 5G private networks and help clients build targeted businesses within the ICT ecosystem , such as services for banking, healthcare, and learning,” Karolina says. “And operators can differentiate themselves by offering exceptional sales, digital, and analytics capabilities.” Finally, 5G and cloud-native networking will be foundational to any such development effort. “They will allow operators to innovate more quickly and easily,” Karolina says, “and scale more efficiently—while also reducing risk.” How to succeed in partnerships Technologies are so fast-moving and complex, few operators can go it alone. And even when they do partner, they are having mixed success. McKinsey senior partner Venkat Atluri explains: “Deciding what role to play in an ecosystem and how to build an ecosystem are critical to success: it has to be treated as a transformation.” Telcos, Venkat says, are finding greater opportunities for creating new products in developing countries across Africa and Southeast Asia by partnering with adjacent industries.  ""We see operators crossing over and launching new products in banking, healthcare and other industries,” he explains, “while the more developed markets in Europe and North America offer intriguing opportunities to create new services based on edge computing. This will require partnering with tech developers and cloud partners.” As a first step to partnering, Venkat says, all participants need to define the shared customer promise and decide the role they will play: to orchestrate or participate? Other decisions include assessing infrastructure and talent needs; and defining the operating model to share the value. For instance, should it be a fee-based structure or a sharing of upside including equity? “Any collaboration should be approached with the thinking that the relationship should deliver value of 1+1=10,” Venkat concludes. related How our latest work helps leaders get ready for the 5G revolution What we heard at MWC Barcelona 2019 Never miss a story"

McKinsey launches new health initiative aiming to add &ldquo;years to life and life to years&rdquo;,"The McKinsey Health Institute is committed to globally lifting quality of life, increasing the portion of life spent in good health, and extending life expectancy.",2022-04-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20launches%20new%20health%20initiative/mhi-hero-small-1157152826-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-launches-new-health-initiative-aiming-to-add-years-to-life-and-life-to-years,"McKinsey launches new health initiative aiming to add “years to life and life to years” April 1, 2022 The speed and scale of the global response to COVID-19, while imperfect, demonstrated that with resources and motivation, scientific breakthroughs and large-scale behavior change can happen quickly. What might be possible if similar levels of focus, commitment, and collaboration were applied to other health problems that affect massive populations? This week, we launched the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) , a non-profit-generating entity within McKinsey, to turn that possibility into reality. MHI’s mission is to catalyze the actions needed across continents, sectors, and communities to realize possible gains in life expectancy and quality of life. MHI is launching with seven initial focus areas critical to the benefit of society, with a near-term priority of brain health. We sat down with MHI global leaders Tom Latkovic and Martin Dewhurst and co-leader Erica Coe to learn more about MHI, its approach, and how it plans to change things for the better. What is the McKinsey Health Institute? Erica : MHI is dedicated to catalyzing the action required to make a meaningful difference in health around the world. It’s non-profit generating, and it’s not a short-term or time-bound initiative; it’s a new entity that will endure. The premise of MHI is that through unprecedented levels of collaboration, it is possible to not only add years to life but life to years. Tom: We believe that over the next decade, humanity could add as much as 45 billion extra years of higher-quality life (roughly six years per person on average — and significantly more in some countries and populations) and our mission is to help drive change across continents, sectors, and communities to realize this possibility. Martin: We know we can’t do this alone. We are fostering a strong network of organizations committed to improving health through a range of collaboration types — convening and enabling leaders, advancing research, creating and promoting open-access data assets, and stimulating innovation. By sharing resources, innovations, data, and insights in the public domain, MHI hopes to galvanize change both directly and through its ecosystem partners. Tell us more about those opportunities and how MHI might realize them. Tom: Realizing the opportunity will be no easy task. A critical first step is changing how we define health from just the absence of disease to a broad, holistic approach that accounts for physical, mental, social, and spiritual health, as well as all of the influencing factors that affect health — personal attributes, personal behaviors, interventions, environmental attributes. It will be an approach aligned with individual aspirations, recognizing that health is relevant only to the extent it enables people to live fully—to build relationships, work or volunteer, and contribute to society while also enjoying pursuits. Martin : It’s also the case that gains in life expectancy and quality of life will require unprecedented collaboration. Shifting society's mindsets and actions means changes not just in the healthcare industry, but across the private, public, and social sectors. Some of these include approaching health as an investment not an expense, accelerating innovation, scaling what works, and empowering individuals as stewards of their own health. What will MHI focus on, specifically? Martin: MHI’s collaborative work will be within areas of health that have often been under-resourced and under-addressed but can have a critical benefit to society. We’re prioritizing those areas that have the most potential to dramatically improve a large number of people's lives around the world. MHI’s first focus area will be helping people across the world achieve the best possible brain health. Additionally, we will focus on healthy living, infectious diseases, equity and health, healthcare worker capacity, aging, and sustainability and health. Erica: On brain health, we aim to make progress by strengthening cognitive function, improving mental health, and effectively preventing and treating brain disorders. People with brain health conditions are at unacceptably high risk for chronic disease, disability, and early mortality. As a result, brain conditions account for a large and growing portion of the global disease burden — a challenge substantially worsened by COVID-19. Yet it remains one of the least addressed, least resourced health topics. Think about what MHI’s overarching goal of adding years to life and life to years means in the context of brain health. There is a 10 to 25-year reduction in life expectancy for people with serious mental illnesses—a huge opportunity to add years to life. In addition, roughly 75 percent of mental disorders appear by the age of 24, meaning that for people without access to high quality prevention, treatment, or recovery services, most of their lives may be spent in poor quality health—a huge opportunity to add life to years. There is a clear and urgent need to focus on brain conditions and start to make progress towards this goal. Those are broad categories and big problems. How is MHI going to solve them? Tom: Through an approach that supports an ecosystem. We’re going to convene and enable leaders from governments, non-profits, for-profits, and academia to share their learnings and act. As part of McKinsey, we can support this group with research and data. We’re working with an ecosystem of experts and partner institutions to design, conduct, and share research on what works and why. We’re also creating and promoting open-access data assets to empower everyone working on health issues. Finally, we’re working to stimulate innovation through crowdsourcing and competitions. Erica: Within brain health, we already have significant momentum from our work through the Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare , a foundation we’re building on with MHI. For example, we’ve already invested in critical areas such as supporting employee mental health and well being, addressing youth mental health needs and child trauma, integrating primary and behavioral health care, and improving community-based crisis response. Our momentum and success are directly related to the remarkable institutions we’ve collaborated with—that ecosystem that Tom describes. For example, bringing together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health to create meaningful impact. We are keen to deepen and extend these collaborations as we move forward. McKinsey Health Institute What will success look like? Tom : Achieving 45 billion years of higher-quality life requires a number of important shifts, such as more investment in health, disproportionally in promotion and prevention; new measurement standards covering physical, mental, social, and spiritual health and recognizing the underlying influencing factors of health; and employer recognition of health as a business priority. Success for MHI is catalyzing action to enable and accelerate these shifts in a meaningful way. Where does your passion for this topic come from? Erica: The brain health focus of MHI is where my heart lies. My family, like many, has been touched by mental health challenges. Seeing all of the difficulties with the mental health care system in the U.S. first-hand inspired me to dedicate my career to improving outcomes. Fifty percent of people will have a mental or substance use disorder during their lifetime­. That could mean you or a loved one – it touches all of us, regardless of age, income, geography, education, or where one is in life. To have the privilege of leveraging McKinsey’s global platform to solve such an under-resourced, under-addressed challenge – it gives me hope that we can make a difference. To have the privilege of leveraging McKinsey’s global platform to solve such an under-resourced, under-addressed challenge – it gives me hope that we can make a difference. Martin: My professional focus for nearly 30 years has been to improve health—primarily through serving life sciences companies across Europe, US, Asia, and the Middle East and Africa. I am excited about the opportunity to extend and deepen this impact through MHI. I believe the combination of our broader definition of health, our commitment to partnering with others, and the non-profit generating part of our mission opens the aperture to make an important contribution to improving health over the next decade and beyond. Tom: I am grateful to be part of MHI. I find deep purpose and fulfillment in trying to help improve the health of my community and those around the world. Strong health makes it easier to fully use our gifts and live fully. I am also impatient—in a constructive way. I know humanity possesses the insight and resources to demonstrably improve people’s health, and I know we can achieve progress if we choose. I hope to channel that energy to drive more action with greater urgency. Finally, what does this move say about McKinsey? Erica: That McKinsey is unequivocally committed to making a difference in health. That we believe in transformative innovations and are committed to bringing people together to make a difference. The launch of MHI puts a stake in the ground that we think it is possible to achieve 45 billion extra years of higher-quality life over the next decade—so much so that we’re committing to invest resources long-term to make a difference.

McKinsey helps launch a new nonprofit aiming to create $20 billion of wealth for working families,Ownership Works will seek to implement broad-based employee ownership programs across the corporate world.,2022-04-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20helps%20launch%20a%20new%20nonprofit%20aiming%20to%20create%2020%20billion%20of%20wealth%20for%20working%20families/ownershipworks-hero-small-1341969666-1536x864.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-helps-launch-a-new-nonprofit-aiming-to-create-20-billion-of-wealth-for-working-families,"McKinsey helps launch a new nonprofit aiming to create $20 billion of wealth for working families April 5, 2022 Ownership Works, a new nonprofit dedicated to implementing broad-based employee ownership programs across the corporate world to benefit working families, has launched today. McKinsey joins more than 60 organizations across the private, public, and social sectors as a founding partner of the new initiative. “We believe our support of Ownership Works is one way that McKinsey can help create sustainable and inclusive growth,” says McKinsey senior partner Aurobind Satpathy , who helps lead the relationship. “Their approach is a powerful way to drive equitable wealth creation, while helping companies attract and retain the people they need to spur outstanding business performance and growth.” Ownership Works will work to raise awareness and interest in shared-ownership programs and furnish organizations with the tools they need to implement them. According to the nonprofit, the initiative could help millions of lower-income workers and people of color, who have for generations been largely excluded from a range of wealth-building opportunities. By 2030, for example, Ownership Works aims to have generated at least $20 billion of wealth for working families. “This movement is about working in concert to create a future of work where employers and employees can win together,” says Anna-Lisa Miller , executive director of Ownership Works. “We believe broad-based employee ownership should be an important pillar of stakeholder capitalism and of an inclusive, equitable, and resilient economy.” Our research has laid out the massive opportunity for driving inclusive growth . For instance, the median Black household today has only about one-eighth of the wealth held by the median White household. In fact , the actual dollar amounts found in Federal Reserve data are striking: while the median White household has amassed $188,000, the median Black family has about $24,000. If that gap were closed, our research has found , as much as $1.5 trillion in economic output could be unleashed. Ownership Works will advance its mission through several key components. It will work to structure and implement broad-based ownership programs offered at no cost to all employees. It will also work to help organizations create cultures of shared ownership, increase employees’ financial literacy and access to cost-effective financial services, and share data and insights on the impact of shared ownership on employee wellbeing and corporate performance. McKinsey is supporting Ownership Works with expertise and a project team on a pro bono basis, building core infrastructure that will help organizations implement shared ownership programs. “By establishing a standardized and modular step-by-step process with supporting tools for each step, Ownership Works will be able to scale up its capacity to bring on board companies who are excited to join the shared ownership movement,” says McKinsey partner Brian Loh, who is helping to lead the effort. This movement is about working in concert to create a future of work where employers and employees can win together. Elsewhere, the organization’s founding partners will contribute in a variety of ways. Financial services firms and pension funds have committed to elevate shared ownership as an ESG strategy; public companies with employee ownership will share expertise; and investment firms have committed to create replicable models for shared ownership. “Ownership Works is incredibly grateful for McKinsey’s investment in our shared vision,” says Anna-Lisa. “Through a significant contribution of expertise and resources, McKinsey is helping us stand up an employee ownership advisory practice that will position companies to not only share wealth with lower-income and diverse employees but also improve workplace culture and employee engagement. We’re thrilled that McKinsey has joined the shared ownership movement to reimagine equity and build wealth for all.” related McKinsey commits $15 million to support Black-owned businesses and help fuel economic development Year one: Lessons from our new think tank focused on Black lives Never miss a story"

Climate technologies are a necessary part of the solution, and leaders must respond to the urgency of this moment by adopting and scaling them at an unprecedented pace. Through MPCT, we can help them accelerate value creation, realize their most ambitious business objectives and emerge as net-zero champions both within and beyond their respective industries.” Over the last 18 months, companies across industries have reached an inflection point on commitments and targets to achieve net zero. While emissions reductions will be essential to avoiding the worst effects of climate change, recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change make clear there is currently no pathway to keeping global temperature increases within 1.5C without permanently removing gigatons of CO2 already present in the atmosphere and ocean. The world therefore needs leaders to ‘break the curve’ to adopting mature sustainable technologies faster; innovating, deploying, and scaling—at unprecedented speed—technologies with the potential to transform every industry, region, and community. While technologies such as wind and solar are already cost competitive with fossil fuels, these need to scale faster, and they alone will not get us there. “This is a clear opportunity to create sustainable growth,” explains McKinsey senior partner and MPCT co-leader Martin Linder . “Across industries, we see significant near-term value-at-stake residing in sustainability technologies that are ready for commercial scaling, along with a long tail of emerging climate technologies that will reach commercial maturity within the next decade.” MPCT is structured around 10 technologies that are critical to decarbonize our society, ranging from hydrogen and battery storage to alternative proteins and nature-based solutions. We will partner with clients as they embrace these technologies at scale and work to protect our planet, helping them define the role of climate technologies in the net-zero agenda, build climate-technologies businesses, and launch tech-enabled decarbonization transformations. Through more than 50 proprietary assets across technologies, and teamwork between our own distinctive talent and leading experts in the field, we’ll help clients anticipate and respond to the impact of new technologies and revolutionize the way they think about established technologies. Climate technology is the single most important contributor to the decarbonization transition. Leaders must embrace and scale it now to drive sustainable growth for their organizations—and a sustainable future for the planet Our research and insights, meanwhile, will help leaders understand the latest on climate technologies and required system changes, covering areas including capital investment requirements, scaling economics, prices, regulations, environmental impact, and much more. To drive collaboration and joint action in the development and deployment of climate technologies, we will convene disruptors and leading players alike in the climate technology ecosystem and partner with organizations on the frontlines of climate innovation. These include the Hydrogen Council , the Long Duration Energy Storage Council , and the Coalition for Negative Emissions , with whom we most recently published an exhaustive analysis of negative emissions and their centrality to achieving 1.5°C pathways. “Climate technology is the single most important contributor to the decarbonization transition,” says McKinsey senior partner Bernd Heid , an MPCT co-leader. “Leaders must embrace and scale it now to drive sustainable growth for their organizations—and a sustainable future for the planet.” related Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero Our latest commitment to protect the planet: Reaching net-zero climate impact by 2030 Never miss a story"

The winners of the HBR McKinsey Award explain. April 12, 2022 When you buy a can of beans, you can read the label and know exactly how many grams of protein, fat, and calories you are consuming. Robert “Bob” Kaplan and Karthik Ramanna have applied the same principle to measuring greenhouse gases (GHG). “When you purchase a car, for example, you’ll see how much CO 2 was created in producing that car, which you can think about amortizing over the life of the car along with the GHG from the fuel you burn, based on the car’s fuel efficiency,” explains Bob. “If companies can start reliably reporting their GHG numbers, and their customers and consumers begin looking for this type of information, it can create lasting, realistic changes in behavior across the economy to address climate change.” Bob and Karthik have won the 63 rd Annual HBR McKinsey Award, which honors the best Harvard Business Review article of the year, for their story outlining a new rigorous approach to measuring greenhouse gases. It integrates basic financial and cost accounting practices with advances in both blockchain technologies and in calculating direct emissions. Using their approach, companies can produce auditable and contractible corporate climate accounts in their pursuit of more sustainable growth. Most companies report their emissions using the GHG Protocol , the authors explain, established 20 years ago and updated several times since. It outlines 3 types of emissions: Scope 1 which are direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a company, such as its production equipment; these are about 15 to 20 percent of a typical company’s total GHG footprint. Scope 2 covers emissions at facilities that generate electricity bought and consumed by the company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain including end users. Bob and Karthik focus on Scope 3 emissions. “As currently defined, they are almost impossible to measure,” says Karthik. “A car maker or aerospace manufacturer would have to reach out to tens of thousands of suppliers and suppliers’ suppliers, and say, ‘Tell us how many greenhouse gases are in every one of the tens of thousands of components we buy from you.’ As a result, companies are allowed to substitute industry-standard metrics for actual numbers, and carbon reporting becomes riddled with guesstimates. Scope 3 eliminates the incentives for companies to invest in reliable and auditable climate data.” In addition, the GHG Protocol requires multiple counting of the same emissions by the many companies in a supply and distribution chain, creating redundancy and reducing accuracy. So, many companies don’t even report Scope 3 emissions. “The largest part of a company’s carbon footprint goes unaccounted for, and this was the measurement problem we set out to solve,” Karthik adds. Bob describes himself as a “quant guy” and is a senior fellow and professor emeritus at Harvard Business School. Trained in electrical engineering and operations research, he learned to teach accounting at Carnegie-Mellon’s Tepper school and has written on healthcare, strategy, and risk management, winning his previous HBR McKinsey Award in 1984. Finalists for the HBR McKinsey Award The Circular Business Model Authors: Atalay Atasu, Celine Dumas, and Luke N. Van Wassenhoven Unconscious Bias Training that Works Authors: Francesca Gino and Katherine Coffman Net Promoter 3.0 Authors: Fred Reichheld, Darci Darnell, and Maureen Burns Karthik is a professor and director of the Master of Public Policy Program at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government. A graduate of MIT and an expert on accounting, business-government relations, and organizational trust-building in society, he is also a prolific writer of case studies, for which he won three international awards. “We work well together,” says Bob, “we finish each other’s sentences.” As Bob and Karthik delved into the research, they independently realized, ‘Actually we know how to solve this.’ It’s basic accounting—but applied to the physical measurements of gas rather than physical quantities of cash. In the article, they illustrate their new approach to GHG measurement using the example of a car-door manufacturer and its supply chain. As a first step, the company records the quantity of GHG in the products and services it buys from its tier-1 suppliers. Then, environmental engineers estimate a company’s Scope 1 emissions from its own production and distribution processes. Both these data are entered into a new E-liability account, and, using activity-based costing , are assigned down to all of its outputs of products and services. For example, a steel sheet’s E-liability would include its share of the on-site greenhouse gases generated in its production, plus the accumulated greenhouse gases from all the input products that had been purchased and used in its production process (including a depreciated share of GHGs from its capital equipment). The E-liability attaches to the steel sheet as it moves through the value chain, adding up or subtracting down along the way, depending on the emissions and offsetting activities of various intermediary companies. For example, when it is transferred to a shipping company for transport, each ton carries its share of accumulated E-liabilities—starting with the mining company, through the plant production process—and now includes emissions from the shipping itself. If one of the intermediaries along the way has engaged in carbon-abatement activities such as reforestation, the E-liability metric may be reduced to reflect this. “This approach is simple, even elegant,” says Karthik. “It leverages the existing accounting system by adding a second field for GHG, alongside the currency field. The E-liability information travels with the product. As you go from stage to stage, you could put it on a blockchain so auditors can go in and check on it, providing both transparency and integrity. The key insight was to measure and transmit GHG information at the output level, exactly the way inventory accounting works—not at your enterprise or facility level.” Since Scope 3 emissions were impossible to measure accurately, companies didn’t have much incentive to reduce them. “We basically lost 20 years of corporate innovation because we had an accounting system that didn’t recognize decarbonization winners, and prospective customers couldn’t trust the numbers,” points out Karthik. “Now, we have a rigorous and low-cost method of measurement, which we hope will take off and align the power of competitive markets to address climate change.” As a next step , Bob and Karthik will be piloting their approach with a number of companies, and have been reaching out to regulators. “We think this is a critical missing element for companies undertaking net zero pathways,” says Bob. “Because if you don’t measure it well, you can’t manage it and improve it.” related Why are innovative cultures so hard to get right?

The joint effort, called Frontier, is an advance market commitment (AMC), which aims to expand the global supply of carbon removal, rather than increase competition for the supply that exists today. McKinsey’s insights have shaped the climate dialogue for more than a decade and this partnership is yet another step in our commitment to building a more sustainable future. “Reaching net zero emissions is key to building environmental resilience and to realizing a future that delivers sustainable and inclusive growth. Carbon removals have an essential role to play,” says McKinsey Senior Partner, Dickon Pinner. “Frontier will play a catalytic role in enabling the supply of high-quality carbon removals.” Scientists estimate that limiting warming to 1.5°C would reduce the odds of initiating the most dangerous and irreversible effects of climate change. Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make clear there is currently no pathway to keeping global temperature increases within 1.5°C without removing gigatons of CO 2 already present in the atmosphere and ocean. Indeed, to reach a pathway to 1.5°C , IPCC models require carbon removals to ramp up from 0.1 gigatons of CO 2 today to an average of around 6 gigatons by 2050. Carbon removals work alongside emissions reduction solutions; they are not a substitute. But at the current pace, the pipeline of carbon removal projects will fall short of the volume of carbon removals the IPPC says is required in 2025 by 80 percent . How negative emissions can help organizations meet their climate goals While this outlook seems bleak, recent analysis by McKinsey Sustainability for the Coalition for Negative Emissions finds that it’s possible to scale carbon removals sustainably to meet the climate need with a portfolio of approaches. To achieve this will take extraordinary efforts in building new capital projects, developing specialist skills and scaling supply chains. However, once carbon removals are deployed at gigaton scale, the average cost could decrease dramatically, saving anywhere from $4.2 trillion to $8.4 trillion to deploy as compared to today’s costs. What’s more, our analysis shows scaling these efforts could create as many as ten million new jobs by 2050. It’s with this urgency in full view that McKinsey Sustainability has chosen to join the Frontier effort in support of developing carbon removal technology. This move is aligned with our commitment to sustainability and our view that joining forces with leading organizations and creating scalable solutions are necessary steps toward reaching this essential goal. Getting such huge amounts of carbon removed from the atmosphere requires the buy-in of companies and governments. But new technologies tend to be more expensive than established ones, making it challenging to attract enough buyers to help drive those prices down. That’s where an advanced market commitment like Frontier can play a crucial role. As an AMC, Frontier will both facilitate low-volume pre-purchase agreements for new carbon removal technologies and invest in future tons of carbon removal to help scale effective technologies. This AMC model was first effectively used to advance pneumococcal vaccines in an effort to save lives. AMCs can be effective because they send a strong and immediate demand signal, encouraging further innovation and development of new technologies in the space. Reaching net zero emissions is key to building environmental resilience and to realizing a future that delivers sustainable and inclusive growth. Carbon removals have an essential role to play. Frontier will play a catalytic role in enabling the supply of high-quality carbon removals. This partnership comes on the heels of our recently launched McKinsey Platform for Climate Technologies , part of McKinsey Sustainability. MPCT focuses on helping clients plan, execute and scale net-zero technologies in recognition of this urgent call to action. And while we have prioritized helping clients achieve net zero emissions, we’re also deeply committed to it ourselves. Last year, we pledged to achieve net-zero climate impact as a firm by 2030. Today, by joining as a founding member of Frontier, we are committing to help rid the atmosphere and ocean of gigatons of existing CO 2 through further expansion of the global supply of carbon removal. Together, we aim to send a strong demand signal that not only is there a market for this technology, there is, on our part, a commitment to make it happen. Never miss a story"
Why hybrid intelligence is the future of artificial intelligence at McKinsey,"This week, our firm marks a new chapter for QuantumBlack, which becomes the unified AI arm of McKinsey. Find out what differentiates our approach to AI and how it&rsquo;s helping our clients.",2022-04-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/hybrid%20intelligence%20the%20future%20of%20artificial%20intelligence/quantumblack-hero-small-sougwen-0370-1536x864.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/hybrid-intelligence-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence,"Why hybrid intelligence is the future of artificial intelligence at McKinsey Artist and researcher Sougwen Chung creates a painting using AI to guide robotic arms. The work brings to life the concept of hybrid intelligence and will form the basis for QuantumBlack’s new visual identity. April 29, 2022 In 2015, McKinsey acquired QuantumBlack, a sophisticated analytics start-up of more than 30 data scientists, data engineers, and designers based in London. They had made their name in Formula 1 racing, applying data science to help teams gain every possible advantage in performance. Healthcare, transportation, energy, and other industry clients soon followed. Many times, acquisitions melt quietly into the parent company. This isn’t the case for QuantumBlack; it has been an accelerating force for our work in analytics. Today, it enters a new chapter by officially becoming the unified AI arm of McKinsey. “When we talk about helping our clients achieve sustainable and inclusive growth , AI is naturally part of the conversation. It’s transforming all businesses, including the way we, as McKinsey, serve organizations,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky , who along with Alex Singla leads QuantumBlack. Over the past seven years, the QuantumBlack community has helped McKinsey achieve a number of feats: building and then donating Kedro , an industry-leading developer tool, to the open-source community; being named a Leader in AI ; and supporting women in technology through community efforts and mentorship. The team grew quickly, to 400 in 2020, and now has more than 1000 technical practitioners across the globe today. Along the way, QuantumBlack has been a critical part of many digital and AI transformations across industries. “We have now brought together all of our analytics colleagues under one umbrella called QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey,” says Alex Singla, “sharing a single culture and strongly defined career pathways, and using common methods and tools.” Team members range from deeply experienced data scientists and engineers to AI-fluent business consultants. The firm has also undertaken intensive training and certification in all aspects of AI and machine learning, including digital and analytics risk. “One thing that hasn ’ t changed: our original principle of combining the brilliance of the human mind and domain expertise with innovative technology to solve the most difficult problems,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky. “We call it hybrid intelligence , and it starts from day one on every project.” AI initiatives are known to be challenging; only one in ten pilots moves into production with significant results. “Adoption and scaling aren’t things you add at the tail end of a project; they’re where you need to start,” points out Alex Singla. “We bring our technical leaders together with industry and subject-matter experts so they are part of one process, co-creating solutions and iterating models. They come to the table with the day-to-day insights of running the business that you’ll never just pick up from the data alone.” Our end-to-end and transformative approach is what sets McKinsey apart. Clients are taking notice: two years ago, most of our AI work was single use cases, and now roughly half is transformational. Another differentiating factor is the assets created by QuantumBlack Labs . “We capture the insights we have learned over the years with industries and fuse them with the best technologies to stay at the forefront,” explains Matt Fitzpatrick , a senior partner who leads QuantumBlack Labs with Jeremy Palmer. These tech assets can solve up to 70 percent of the work that used to be done on a bespoke basis. “We already know how to tie the analytic model into the client’s data pipelines. Now we have industry models that are plug-and-play with security, scalability, and risk management already baked in,” says Paul Beaumont , a senior principal data scientist based in Singapore. For example, the CustomerOne toolkit for telecommunications companies can reduce time to market for analytics campaigns by 75 percent. QuantumBlack Labs will expand significantly over the next year: “We want to become a magnet for the best technologists in the world and create assets that bring together all of our knowledge, so we can take this to our clients,” says Matt. Today, our experts work in major cities around the globe, but one tradition from QuantumBlack’s early days remains. “There has always been beautiful art on the walls, a deep commitment to high-quality design, and a fantastic community and culture,” recalls Kat Shenton , who has been with QuantumBlack since 2017. The team recently engaged Sougwen Chung , an AI artist and researcher, to create a painting that brings to life the concept of hybrid intelligence and will form the basis for QuantumBlack’s new visual identity. As a first step in the artistic process, QuantumBlack data scientists processed data from a river to train its CausalNex machine learning model. “It was the ideal tool for this project because it intrinsically requires humans and tech to work together,” explains Paul. Sougwen further developed the model, adding her own biofeedback. The model guides the movement of two robotic arms that paint alongside her to create a beautiful swirling visual. The result, as you can see in the film on this page, is a meld of artistry and technology that expresses the cutting-edge work we do for our clients. related QuantumBlack continues expansion with two new offices in Asia QuantumBlack opens in Montreal, a leading center of AI Never miss a story"

Protecting workers through award-winning design,"3M and McKinsey Design have partnered to create a welding helmet that has transformed the daily lives of welders around the world. The product has won nearly a dozen international awards, including a 2021 &ldquo;Best of the Best&rdquo; Red Dot Award.",2021-12-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20design/how%20we%20help%20clients/protecting%20workers%20through%20award%20winning%20design/3m-page-thumb_clay-sculptures_39_final%20for%20scan_1536x1536.jpg,"Design,Product Design",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/protecting-workers-through-award-winning-design,"Protecting workers through award-winning design Welding is hot, dangerous, and dirty work. Welders spend long hours on their feet and often work outside: on bridges, at race tracks, in oil fields, and other sites. Welding strains eyesight, the neck, and shoulders. Fumes are toxic and burns common. For 40 years, our Sweden-based design team has collaborated first with Speedglas and then with 3M to design, and continually improve, welding helmets. With every product cycle, the joint team started from scratch, reimagining and redesigning the helmets, with innovations that sometimes shifted the entire industry. Our partnership has helped to improve welders’ safety and comfort under dangerous and strenuous working conditions. It started in 1983 when a tiny company called Speedglas invented a new type of welding glass. It darkened automatically in response to the bright light of a welding arc, freeing welders from having to constantly “nod” the shield up and down as they worked. Other innovations over the years included a device that pivots the shield up and back over the crown of the head, rather than resting at the forehead, easing neck pain. Internal padding that skirted pressure points, reducing headaches. A two-way fan system that improved breathability. A textile covering that captured stray glass crystals. A curved design for glass that extended peripheral vision. Our partnership has produced seven signature helmet designs, with accessories, which have won 11 international awards, including a 2021 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award , and are now sold in 60+ countries. But most importantly, our work together has helped to protect welders around the world . Our North Star How do you sustain a 40-year partnership and reinvent the same product in fresh, new ways, again and again? “From our first contact in the mid-80s, we realized that if we worked together we could do something exceptional for our end users: the welders,” reflects Anders Grönberg , the global portfolio leader of welding at 3M. An engineer and market economist by training, Anders has led the development of the helmets for 25+ years, since joining Speedglas in 1990, and then moving on to 3M when it bought the company in 2004. “This has been our common interest during all these years: That we fulfill their needs today and in the future. The fact that we have been successful has, of course, also strengthened the relationship.” When Speedglas was first invented, industries in Sweden were advanced when it came to personal protective equipment. “Organizations were very keen to take care of their users,” recalls Anders. “We got a lot of suggestions and improvements from welders. We took notes with paper and pen and would go back to the office, share the information, and it would grow from there.” “Our North Star has always been to do the research where the welders are most comfortable: at his or her welding bench,” explains Oskar Juhlin , a McKinsey Design alumnus who led the helmet design work from 1983 to 2019. “If you bring someone into a design workshop, office, or other synthetic area, they won’t be as straightforward as they would be in their own environment. We also welded in our own studios, so we could test out the designs ourselves .” Design matters We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design. Early on, it was a challenge to talk to welders about design; at the time it was typically understood to be a field concerned with aesthetics alone. “One guy told me ‘I don’t care about how it looks, as long as I like it,’” he remembers. “Many welders work on race cars. Well it was a different story when I said, ‘So it doesn’t matter what wheels you put on your car?’ Yes, it does! So, then design is important? We had to teach people how to have a discussion about design.” Over time, the customer base grew to include countries in Asia and the US, where customers were very interested in the helmet technologies and had ideas for improvements. “There were more regulatory requirements to fulfil, so user research expanded into a more formal system,” recalls Anders. “We also realized we had to look beyond the current moment and anticipate the welders’ future needs.” Today, a product road map guides the design planning from three to five years out, with the goal of introducing a new helmet model every two years. “The cycles are getting shorter as the technology is changing more quickly,” says Anders. How we work The typical product cycle begins with the R&D team at 3M presenting the newest technical capabilities to three our four McKinsey industrial designers.  Many have worked together for years. The designers will have a wish list of what they’d like it to look like, as well as new materials, textiles, and fabrics to consider. “You design the helmet with several design concepts, on paper, in computer, foam and clay models, exploring different shapes and trying out materials,” explains Emelie Hedén Edlund , a design director who specializes in color, materials, and finish —or CMF, as it’s known— and worked on the later models. “You touch it, feel it, and then you go back to the computer again. There is a lot of back-and-forth between digital and physical hands-on testing.” The design studio is located in a large converted missionary church in Stockholm, with workshops for sewing, foam and wood working, metal working, and welding. As the design phase unfolds, the joint teams meet in a series of workshops, sitting together for one or two days testing out new prototypes, splitting up to work separately and do homework, and then coming back together to validate new iterations. Then they go to the welders to try out the prototypes and confirm they are moving in the right direction. If so, they go on to the next stage: the critical step of ensuring that the helmet model can be manufactured in high volumes . Hans Nyström , associate design director at McKinsey, recalls one inspiring meeting. “The extended 3M team and our designers were at the table, discussing a very complicated prototype. And it was clear that it weighed too much. No one wanted to raise their hand and say ‘it’s my work that’s causing this.’”  On the spur of the moment, the McKinsey team proposed a workshop: to get tools and drills out, then and there, and find ways to cut the weight. Together the entire team looked at every component—drill a hole here, nip away material there. They lost ounces. “From that experience, we all saw a better way of working. By sharing the common goal, it changed the whole mindset of the team,” Emelie said. “It doesn’t feel like a client relationship, but like a partnership.” “It feels good to work with a partner who has so much trust,” says Hans. “3M has an appreciation of good design—we share that as a starting point. We complement each other skill-wise. They have the deep technical and mechanical expertise while we focus on the design and exterior surfaces. We are on the same software systems, so it’s a seamless integrated workflow. Together we share a wealth of knowledge.” Giving emotional resonance to a functional object Over the years, our designers have drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources including medieval knights, superheroes, ergonomics, and Chinese acupressure. But for many, the helmet model closest to their hearts is the 9000 launched in 1996. It was the first time user research had been incorporated into every step, and it was a major departure in design. The shape of the helmet morphed from a square mailbox into a mask that felt more like a natural extension of the wearer’s face. “The design team had a lot of discussions with the welders about the emotional aspects or character we wanted to express,” explains Hans. “It had to be very professional, powerful. Welders are very proud of their work–just think of the image of Rosie the Riveter, who was a welder. This was the heritage of the profession. If it were in a movie, the helmet would have to be fit for a hero knight on a black dragon.” Designers introduced a ridge down the middle of the helmet face to suggest the look of armor and expressed trust through open forehead lines and other facial nuances. The ‘line of sight’ is angled downward, focused on the hands—the work. This model also incorporated the ability to exhale through side vents. “At the time, they were actually put on mannequins in the windows of one of Stockholm’s finest department stores as a fashion item because they looked so cool,” recalls Emelie. “They went from being a very functional object to having an emotional element.” The helmet would be cited as an example of ‘futuristic’ design for the next ten years. After it was launched in 1996, the strikingly futuristic 3M Speedglas 9000 helmet was displayed on mannequins in the department store Nordiska Kompaniet in Stockholm. Breathing easier Three years later, the team introduced the Speedglas Adflo, an air-purifying respirator that circulated air to reduce heat and improve breathability. It was a fan attachment that fit snugly down the welder’s body, fastened with a belt at the waist. This tight profile reduced the risk of the welder getting snagged on the equipment. “It was a revolutionary change,” said Oskar. “All of the other fans on the market had a round filter attached to the back which looked like a mushroom. By 2014, we went to a trade show, and every fan on market had this tight, streamlined look—our design had moved the market.” Last year, 3M launched the G5-02 for highly precise TIG welding. The helmet holds the world’s first curved glass shield, a design that follows the shape of a user’s head and opens up the full range of their peripheral vision. This year, it won the Red Dot award with a Best of the Best distinction. Looking ahead, Oskar predicts: “The helmets will become almost like a second skin, with softer, high-tech materials rather than hard plastic which is bulky, uncomfortable, noisy. Shields are already connected to blue tooth so you can maneuver equipment with a phone; there will be developments with cameras and video, and radar may be used for detecting the target, rather than light.” The evening news While the awards and external praise are gratifying, some of the most satisfying recognition has come from welders themselves. “We have had many, many stories, but there are a couple that are more famous within 3M,” Anders says. “We had a welder here in Sweden who we were visiting at his work site. We had just introduced the respiratory protection together with the helmet. After a moment’s thought, he said that he liked the helmet now because he could actually watch the late news on television. Before he began using the respirator, he was so tired that he would fall asleep before the news had started. That was an indication to us that the product that we had supplied to the market was actually helping to improve our users’ quality of life. It is a huge motivation for all of the people in our company to continue working with this kind of product.” For Oskar, the ultimate recognition came with the futuristic 9100 series. “Some welders tattooed themselves with images of that shield,” says Oskar. “That says something about our design.” Related Practices Design | Operations | Technology Related Articles How a McKinsey co-designed robot is creating a better future for minimally invasive surgery Innovation by design: How we helped Hyundai create an award-winning charger How award-winning design is helping older adults live safely and with dignity at home"

Historically, such uncertainty has catalyzed organizations to invest in modernizing the technology behind their business operating models. But traditional approaches to ERP modernization have too often fallen short in maximizing business value, leaving C-suite priorities like corporate strategy and organizational mindset as afterthoughts. Case study: Merck KGaA Merck KGaA, a world-leading life sciences company, worked on an ERP transformation with SAP and McKinsey. According to Alessandro de Luca, group CIO at Merck, the company initially approached the effort as a technical project. They hadn’t considered the fundamental strategic challenges of cross-sector business objectives, including disconnects between system architecture and operational reality. Through physical and process redesign efforts, SAP and McKinsey helped Merck identify possible complexities and develop a global ERP roadmap that resulted in an integrated business case that addressed business value and IT changes. Overseen by an organizational structure and supported through CEO governance, the effort consolidated Merck’s ERP landscape while decommissioning legacy systems. “The combination of SAP’s technical skills and McKinsey’s consulting expertise has boosted Merck’s ERP strategy and roadmap, helping us deliver more value for Merck’s business divisions and enabling functions,” said Mr. de Luca. “Working with both organizations for this project was critical. Without the seamless integration of their teams, we would not have been able to achieve the level of impact we did.” To address this, SAP and McKinsey have drawn on their individual strengths to create a strategic alliance that merges technology modernization with strategy execution, thereby driving business results and addressing critical business challenges. With an initial industry focus on consumer products, retail, automotive, and manufacturing, SAP and McKinsey will offer an end-to-end design for SAP S/4HANA migration. Most recently, Merck KGaA, a world-leading life sciences company, worked with SAP and McKinsey to transform the company’s complex ERP system, moving from a collection of legacy platforms to a consolidated global system, complete with a new organizational structure and governance model. “Every enterprise needs to develop new business models to avoid being disrupted, gain efficiencies to fund innovation, and transform mission-critical systems in a way that minimizes business risk,” SAP CEO Christian Klein told a Sapphire Orlando audience this week. “This alliance ensures that McKinsey and SAP can work side-by-side to focus on deploying the right ERP with the highest ROI and sustained value from technology investments, enabling clients to tap into numerous new value pools.” In addition to the Merck case, this alliance has already delivered compelling impact for a range of clients, including a renowned European grocer that was able to counteract increasing cost pressures from competitors while fulfilling the increasing digital demand of customers. Within the four-month initiation phase, the grocer set up a transformation management function that evaluated outside-in perspectives on current trends and future requirements for all business functions. This helped determine a target operating model for the future ERP landscape, and as a result, the grocer developed target operating models for retail, supply chain, category management, and finance, establishing a new future-proof business model. “Technology enables speed, and it can play an outsized role in driving sustainable, inclusive growth,” said McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels . “SAP and McKinsey’s relationship brings together strategic thinking with technical implementation, helping the boldest leaders find enduring solutions to our most urgent challenges.” related Partnering with the world’s leading tech companies to accelerate innovation Never miss a story"

Sometimes called product owners or technical product managers , people in these roles are responsible for several things: shaping a software product based on customer needs, pressure testing it for business viability, collaborating across engineering teams to build the product, and working with sales and marketing to commercialize and take the product to market. Our latest research shows that about 60 percent of companies across industries say that they view software as a source of competitive advantage or the primary focus of their business. As companies grow their product management function , they will need to quickly train new product managers (PMs) and upskill existing ones. But effective, accessible training is hard to find. McKinsey Product Academy is an ongoing, cohort-based speaker series featuring prominent leaders on an array of timely topics. We spoke with Rikki Singh, a Silicon Valley-based associate partner in McKinsey Digital , about the launch of the McKinsey Product Academy . The program, which launched earlier this month, has over 9,000 signups as of this publication. What is the McKinsey Product Academy? McKinsey Product Academy is McKinsey’s investment in empowering product managers of the future in an inclusive way. On May 13th, we launched our Product Academy Fundamentals program, an eight-part speaker series featuring leading voices from across the product world. This is an extension of our existing Product Academy Immersion program, an eight-week bootcamp tailored to the needs of an organization. Why is McKinsey making an investment in product managers? We conducted research with more than 400 companies and found that product management is key to driving successful business impact of software investments. What we’re also seeing is the rise of product roles even in non-software or non-traditional tech companies. Think about a retailer using a software transformation as a source of growth, its success relies on getting the product management role right. By 2025, there will be three to four million PMs globally, many of them new. And they wouldn’t all come from traditional tech paths. They may be in other roles and transitioning to a PM role because their organization is going through a software transformation. So, upskilling and equipping these PMs for success is critical. We want to become the top destination for existing PMs to learn and grow on that journey and for those looking to switch into the product management track to be able to do that successfully. This is aligned with our firm-wide mission of sustainable and inclusive growth. Everyone who needs to be a PM should have an accessible starting point. People participating in Product Academy Fundamentals will be from a wide range of sectors. How did you approach designing the series to meet broad needs? The fundamentals of building a software product are always the same. There are some nuances that come up as far as hardware or software, and we do adapt based on that. Our overarching goal was to cover topics that touch every aspect of a product development lifecycle ranging from defining product strategy to customer advocacy to building platforms. We then found leaders with hands-on experience to share their expertise and unique backgrounds. Finally, we included topics such as product outside of traditional tech companies and responsible product management to cater to the wide breadth of PMs. How will empowering more product managers affect businesses and business leaders? We’re aiming to empower product executives who are going be leading the charge on the next wave of product management. There are big-picture questions executives will ask PMs to lead on: How do we become more innovative? How do we ensure that we're customer-backed and what we're building is addressing their needs? Companies also need to think about responsible product development . How do they, as product leaders, build products that take into account privacy, sustainability, and inclusion? We want product managers to work with product leaders to move the field toward these goals. What will success look like? Training and enabling over one million PMs in the next three to five years would be our definition of success. We want to create a community of engaged product managers. This speaker series is just the first wave, so we’ll gather feedback and continue creating and refining future programs to serve this community as best as possible. We believe all companies can get product management right and they should start the journey now. Would you like to learn more about how we help software companies?

"Growth, inflation, and adapting to unpredictable times","With inflation continuing to impact consumers, businesses, and economies globally, Alex Abdelnour breaks down the best strategies for adjusting and thriving.",2022-05-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/adapting%20to%20inflation%20ask%20an%20expert/inflation-hero-small-v2-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/adapting-to-inflation-ask-an-expert,"Growth, inflation, and adapting to unpredictable times May 20, 2022 From boardrooms to grocery stores, inflation is affecting everyone. Prices are up over 7 percent in the United States and more around the world—with no signs of coming down anytime soon. Businesses are already reeling, and tired, from two years of a global pandemic that required nimble, innovative solutions. But it’s time again to strategize, says Alex Abdelnour , a partner working with clients on growth strategy, price optimization, and revenue management. Managing inflation effectively to limit disruption is possible, and Alex has helped identify a variety of tools and practices to help. Alex grew up in Lebanon and came to the US in 2005 to earn his Ph.D. at Georgia Tech in engineering. He’s made Atlanta home and built a family of four children with his wife. The inflation crisis is top of mind not only for his work, but for his family in Beirut, a nation that has been struck by soaring inflation. The currency has drastically devalued even as prices have skyrocketed. We spoke with him to get insight into strategies that businesses and consumers need to weather the coming months. What are consumers and business leaders facing right now? In short, a new reality. According to our latest research on consumer sentiment , consumer confidence dipped in February 2022. Only 38 percent of our survey respondents said they feel optimistic, down from 44 percent in October 2021. And the steepest drop was among high-income consumers, a group that had been buying more-expensive products and brands in 2020 and 2021. Business leaders will need to figure out what consumers today find most compelling when it comes to value. To do this well, the big picture for them is visibility and insight into operations, data to inform decisions, quick thinking, and strengthening business relationships. Is raising prices the only option for companies? What else should they consider? They need to address their own leaky buckets. Most companies don't measure the cost of inefficient operations that eat away at profits. A client who orders three times a week rather than one big order requires more shipping costs, and three people to answer phone calls and conduct follow up. Ordering specialty items and processing returns—all of these cost money but are rarely measured or accounted for. So even though an account or a customer could look very positive from a profitability perspective, once you add in all the elements of cost to serve, it might come as a shock how many are not profitable. This visibility end to end allows for addressing issues that erode profit margins—rather than raising prices. How can companies approach auditing these ‘leaky buckets’ and finding solutions? By collecting and understanding data. I’ve seen multiple situations recently where companies are not tracking data at the rep level, account level, or VP level. They’re not reporting data weekly to hold people accountable. They’re not doing that drum beat of reviews week over week, not doing the necessary analytics to understand which accounts are rejecting a price increase, which items are still struggling, and where the company is out of sync with the market. All of that tracking and heavy analytics is often not there. By missing these things, opportunity is left on the table. When price increases must happen, is a flat approach best or is there an art or science to it? It’s very important to play around with the knobs of the price increase to go more aggressive on some products and less on others, because customers have power here as well. They can choose to find another vendor, do without certain items, or substitute with generic or cheaper products. There’s the science of understanding what the market will support, but also the art of knowing your customers and who’s going to be pushing back and leaving you. So, it’s not just about keeping good margins now, it’s about keeping customers for the long term? Definitely. The last thing companies want is to be perceived as price gouging under cover of inflation. Customers are expecting some price increases, but it does not mean that they’re happy about it. It might go alright now because of known supply-chain constraints, but when the situation turns around, companies that have not been surgical around price increases, knowing exactly where to push up prices and where not to push, will pay a price with consumers and clients. There are ways companies can support customers now for long-term retention, even amid price increases. In distribution, companies can partner with customers and identify products in their supply chain that can be swapped out for lower cost substitutes to help them save money. When there is a price increase, communicating about the rationale behind it is key, but it must happen in the context of overall service and strategies to keep providing the best business. The moment the conversation is purely on price is when half the battle is lost. How does inflation affect growth and overall business profitability? What’s important to keep in mind is the difference between gross profit and gross margin. By raising prices revenue increases, and it looks like the company is growing. But if companies do this without maintaining or expanding their gross margin (which is profit dollar as a percent of revenue) then they are effectively less profitable despite topline growth.  Well, that equation destroys shareholder value. The equation that creates the most shareholder value is profitable growth, which is the ability to grow revenue at the same rate as profit. That’s the challenge with inflation: passing cost increases, while maintaining margins and without losing customers. That makes the surgical approach to price increases so important. In this volatile market, how important is it to stay nimble? Decisions in this time have to be accelerated tenfold. With such rare inflation, there’s no business as usual. Every change made has to be monitored and evaluated closely and adjusted quickly if needed. It’s like a military control room—watching as the situation unfolds and making fast decisions. Think of that level of visibility into operations and that speed of assessment and reaction. What should companies keep in mind in these unpredictable times? What goes up must come down. At some point, we’ll be in a deflationary world. Customers will expect prices to come down, and companies that have been disciplined around capturing cost increases they’ve incurred and passed on to customers will be in a better position to reduce prices when deflation happens. Inflation is just a difficult reality now, but the best-in-class companies that I’ve worked with are using this as an opportunity to build long lasting partnership with their customers. They not only maintain profit margin, they work to win market share by partnering with customers, showing them that they care, that they’re willing to go the extra mile on services—so that once this craziness ends, they’re ahead on margin but also on strengthening a relationship with customers. related How to weather inflation Five ways to ADAPT pricing to inflation Never miss a story"
"In Davos, shining a light on the economic future of America: Manufacturing.","Manufacturing was once thought to be a declining industry in the US&mdash;but according to our North America managing partner, the US industrial technology sector is booming.",2022-05-24T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/ask%20an%20expert%20the%20future%20of%20manufacturing%20in%20america/davosasutosh-hero-small-1383599820-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/in-davos-shining-a-light-on-the-economic-future-of-america,"In Davos, shining a light on the economic future of America: Manufacturing. May 24, 2022 Business and political leaders from around the world have gathered in Davos for the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting this week. Asutosh Padhi , McKinsey’s North America managing partner, is on site to share insights on an economic solution for inclusive growth hiding in plain sight: manufacturing. The very word might inspire visions of a fading era that has given way to technology as the harbinger of economic growth. But according to Asutosh, the manufacturing industry is on the bleeding edge of technological innovation. Across the US, he says, it offers well-paying careers and the potential for social and economic upward mobility. Asutosh is a co-author of the upcoming book The Titanium Economy: How Industrial Technology Can Create a Better, Faster, Stronger America . We caught up with him to learn about the economic promise of this sector. Many people might be surprised by your assertion that manufacturing is the future of the economy in the US. What is “The Titanium Economy”? Apple, Google, Amazon, and the like have become synonymous with innovation and symbols of future economic growth. There’s good reason for this: they are among the best-performing stocks of the last decade. But because of their cultural dominance, these digital technology titans can overshadow an impressive set of industrial technology companies that have performed just as well. These companies comprise what we call “The Titanium Economy.” Generally speaking, they produce products that our economy runs on—but consumers don’t necessarily buy: aerospace parts, color enamels, recycled-plastic lumber, and more. They’re further characterized by lean operations, competitive salaries and benefits, inclusive workplace cultures, and a commitment to intelligent innovation. This economy is geographically diverse and product diverse. What’s the biggest misperception about manufacturing you’ve heard at Davos this week? Despite headlines of robots taking jobs and displacing manufacturing, the opposite is true. Making and moving things are still both the fundamental building block for equitable wealth creation and social improvements—but the digital revolution changed the skills needed for careers in this field. In addition, the average lifespan of an industrial company is 28 years, far exceeding that of tech companies, which is six years. It’s true that US manufacturing industries carry heavy scars from the loss of jobs in the 1980s, when plants went dark and entire communities emptied of young people. But today, many companies are bringing their workforces back to the US as they recognize the benefits of building domestically. The industrial tech economy is rising and resilient, beating analyst expectations, and creating jobs with strong salaries and benefits. Nearly half of the companies I studied for my upcoming book outperformed the S&P index from 2015 to 2020. What is the profile of a titanium company? What are the characteristics and values that define them? There are a variety of attributes. Typically, shareholder value comes from operational performance and market share, not solely expansion. These companies create jobs in the US and pay better-than-average wages and benefits. Their boards are generally very engaged, implementing ahead-of-the-curve standards for self-analysis, governance, and oversight. They are often family-owned, but aggressively innovative and committed to ongoing community relationships and education. You’ve talked before about the multiplier effects that a revitalized US manufacturing industry could have. Can you elaborate? Titanium industrials are opening plants, creating jobs, offering training programs, and generating indirect economic and job effects. Economists calculate that every 100 durable manufacturing jobs results in 750 or more indirect jobs—one of the highest multiplier effects of any industry. Industrial tech companies that succeed are often regenerating a community, drawing crops of young professionals, new immigrant families, gig workers, and artists. They also benefit stakeholders across the product cycle, leading to broad social benefits that keep pace with the success of the business. What challenges lie ahead for titanium industrials? If the last two years of empty grocery shelves and delayed deliveries taught us anything, it’s that we need to invest in stronger supply chains. Over decades we have been building supply chains that rely on lean warehouses and just-in-time systems that depend on predictability. These have left companies vulnerable to the risks associated with single suppliers or countries of supply, as well as newer threats like natural disasters and cyber-attacks. To run a healthy, well-functioning supply chain, we must invest in workforce training programs, such as community colleges, technical training programs, and high school courses like wood shop and metal shop. There’s also a stigma associated with manufacturing. Parents and society writ large often have a huge misperception as to the benefits of industrial jobs, which offer stable employment, highly livable wages, and a career path; yet many grads don’t consider a factory job. Beyond economic benefit, what else do titanium industrials promise? Many of these companies are emphasizing environmental responsibility and sustainability, and not just because decreasing environmental impact is a boon with investors and regulators. These companies are forward-thinking innovators. It’s the environment, bolstering food security, making clean energy safer and cheaper, keeping our air and water safe, and fostering and investing in entrepreneurship for the many, and more. Their potential is limitless. Never miss a story"

Years later, when a client enlisted Caserta to bring its data assets to the cloud, we began collaborating with them again. In the past year, we partnered with Caserta to help a financial services client launch a new business offering data and analytics software to a new market. Within weeks, Caserta mobilized improvements in the performance and stability of their cloud-based data infrastructure, improved the pace at which new features could be launched, and began coaching and developing the client’s engineering team. The data-driven enterprise of 2025 That collaboration proved how well-matched our organizations are—and how powerful our complementary skills are. We formalized our relationship, welcoming Caserta’s nearly 50-person team of data engineers, data architects, and data strategists into our firm. Caserta will be fully aligned to our Data Transformation Practice and will focus its work on the highest impact transformation opportunities across sectors. “The teams at Caserta want to work on challenging, cutting-edge problems, and they want their work to have impact for businesses—and their employees, particularly through capability building,” says Kayvaun Rowshankish , McKinsey senior partner and global co-leader of the firm’s Data Transformation Practice. “Unlike a lot of other data engineering shops, which tend to want to build code and get out, Caserta is more focused on long-term impact. This is consistent with our values, which makes it an undisputable fit.” Founded in 2001 by Joe Caserta, considered a visionary and pioneer in the data-engineering space, Caserta has established a stellar reputation, having designed and implemented cutting-edge data architectures for many Fortune 100 companies. They have built and created cloud native data lakes, data streaming capabilities, and pioneering thought leadership in metaverse data engineering. In one instance, they helped a leading music streaming service build out the complex cloud platform crucial to its operations. “When I formed Caserta, McKinsey was the model I used to stay laser-focused on positively impacting the goals of our clients,” says Joe. “There is nothing more exciting as a CEO of a tech consulting firm than building a business around solving uniquely complex problems, having our teams get completely immersed in issues that matter, and creatively constructing winning, actionable solutions that launch our clients into success.” Caserta has created a unique approach to solve the most complex data engineering challenges. They use a proprietary method of linking business needs into tailored data architecture designs. This acquisition creates a significant opportunity to help clients overcome the challenges in building competitive, industry-leading enterprise data environments. “Data is integral to every transformation that’s happening across sectors and geographies in the next three to five years. It’s the competitive edge most firms will be creating and defending and an area where we will see the greatest innovation,” says Kayvaun. “The combination of McKinsey and Caserta will position us to play a pivotal role in moving industries to the next stage of technology transformation.” Caserta enhances how we can work with clients on data strategy and design. They strengthen our ability to deliver end-to-end data transformations, bringing innovative approaches, accelerators, and talent to implement cloud data architectures at enterprise scale, all of which is core to our clients’ digital and analytics development. “Having Caserta join McKinsey allows us the opportunity to solve more comprehensive data challenges and have a significantly elevated role in advancing businesses and society with data,” says Joe. “I am very excited to apply our joint efforts to creatively and deliberately improve lives and businesses around the world.” Never miss a story"
Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech,Generation Singapore is training hundreds of mid-career workers with little or no tech experience for entry-level jobs in the industry.,2022-06-10T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/reskilling%20the%20hardest%20to%20place%20older%20workers%20for%20new%20jobs%20in%20tech/generationsingapore-hero-small-students-1536x864.jpg,"Generation,Sustainability,Inclusive Growth",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/reskilling-older-workers-for-new-careers-in-tech,"Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Participants of Generation Singapore's #GetReadySG initiative, which is training hundreds of mid-career workers with little or no tech experience for entry-level jobs in the industry. June 10, 2022 They won’t catch on to the technology. They’ll have a hard time developing new skills. They won’t relate well to teammates of different generations. These, according to a study by the McKinsey-founded independent nonprofit Generation, are just a few of the misperceptions hiring managers around the world have about job candidates who are between 45 and 60 years old. Generation conducted global research on mid-career workers, surveying more than 1,400 hiring managers and 3,800 job seekers and workers. “Individuals who are 45 and older are wrongly perceived to be the least desirable cohort in terms of skills, readiness for training, and ability to fit into an organization,” explains Mona Mourshed , the founding CEO of Generation. “What was also quite stark was that this perception bias was absolutely universal across every country we surveyed.” But the research also revealed that managers rank these workers the same or higher on job performance than employees a decade younger. Meeting the world’s midcareer moment Generation recently celebrated a milestone of more than 50,000 graduates across 16 countries. While many institutions have contributed to its exponential growth, our firm has served a unique role as founder, funder, and advisor. “We believe in the power of work to transform people’s lives. In our work with Generation, we are contributing our most valuable resource—our people—by enabling them to work side-by-side with Generation staff on a wide range of operational and program initiatives,” says Anna Navratil , head of giving back at McKinsey.  “Reskilling mid-career workers is a critical aspect to helping businesses and communities achieve more inclusive growth.” Generation Singapore has been retraining older workers since 2018. Along the way, the organization has identified specific interventions to help this group secure jobs. Their most recent initiative, #GetReadySG , launched with Microsoft, is training 1000+ unemployed people—40 percent of whom are mid-career workers—with little or no tech experience for entry-level jobs in the industry. These include positions in cloud support and DevOps, business intelligence and data analytics, and full-stack development. By the end of this year, the program expects to have prepared some 500 of its participants for job placement. There is keen demand for tech workers in the island nation, and the government there helps subsidize training for citizens. According to Phua Huishan , the operations lead for Generation Singapore, this has played a key role in the program’s success. “The allowance allows the participants, who may be supporting a family or living on their own, to focus on their training,” Phua says. Reskilling mid-career workers is a critical aspect to helping businesses and communities achieve more inclusive growth. As with all Generation programs, the curriculum is shaped by the organization’s more than 50 employer partners and includes guidance for developing both hard tech capabilities and soft skills:  behaviors and mindsets.
The program starts with an intensive, three-month boot camp specific to a tech role followed by up to six months of apprenticeship with a company. A recent graduate of the program, Syaffi, had a decade of experience in publishing when his company closed due to the pandemic. He explains why he chose Generation over a number of other programs: “It’s a 360-degree approach that is about more than learning the nitty gritty of coding; it’s also training you to think like a coder, with support in your job search that you won't find elsewhere.” Each student works with a mentor, receives training in interview skills and resume writing, and participates in employer networking events. After eight interviews, Syaffi landed a position as a developer with a consulting firm. The tech training is intensive, according to participants. “During boot camp, you learn the basics with a few hundred lines of code per page,”  explains Kenneth, a former restaurant manager who recently graduated from the program as a junior full-stack developer. “But in the apprenticeship, when there is an error, you’re sifting through a few thousand lines of code per page. It’s quite intimidating.” Such challenges demonstrate why “soft skills” training for a growth mindset and persistence are so valuable. Pichaya Deesomsak is a McKinsey fellow who supported the Generation Singapore program and is now helping to set up operations, secure funding, and develop partnerships for Generation Thailand’s program. “Adaptability and willingness to take initiative and find answers are intrinsic to working in tech,” Pichaya says. And for at least one mid-career program graduate, these new skills combined with his long work experience have made him particularly well-suited to flourish his new career. Timothy, a cloud specialist who is over 40 years old, was on the job for a month when his manager told him as much. “Your past experience with people actually helps in being a cloud engineer,” the manager said. “You portray yourself more maturely.” related In just five years, Generation has helped tens of thousands around the world find jobs Making a $30 million commitment to address global unemployment Never miss a story"
Meet the metaverse: Creating real value in a virtual world,"McKinsey senior partners Eric Hazan and Lareina Yee, both lead authors on our new metaverse report, discuss the potential and momentum around this rapidly evolving space.",2022-06-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/meet%20the%20metaverse%20creating%20real%20value%20in%20a%20virtual%20world/mettaverse-hero-small-1381483246-1536x864.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-the-metaverse-creating-real-value-in-a-virtual-world,"Meet the metaverse: Creating real value in a virtual world June 15, 2022 Welcome to the metaverse. Now, where exactly are we? Imagine for a moment the next iteration of the internet, seamlessly combining our physical and digital lives. It’s many things: a gaming platform, a virtual retail spot, a training tool, an advertising channel, a digital classroom, a gateway to entirely new virtual experiences. While the metaverse continues to be defined, its potential to unleash the next wave of digital disruption is clear. In the first five months of 2022, more than $120 billion have been invested in building out metaverse technology and infrastructure. That’s more than double the $57 billion invested in all of 2021. McKinsey has now taken a deep dive into the potential of the metaverse, surveying more than 3,400 consumers and 450 senior leaders globally in its recent report, “ Value Creation in the Metaverse ,” launching this week at VivaTech in Paris. The report aims to better understand the value of the metaverse, how broad adoption could be, where the greatest traction might take place, and what businesses can do now to capture value. We spoke with McKinsey senior partners Eric Hazan and Lareina Yee , both lead authors on the report, about the potential and momentum of this virtual world. How would you define the metaverse? Lareina: What’s exciting is that the metaverse, like the internet, is the next platform on which we can work, live, connect, and collaborate. It’s going to be an immersive virtual environment that connects different worlds and communities. There are going to be creators and alternative currencies that you can buy and sell things with. It will have a lot of the components of Web3 and gaming and AR, but it will be much larger. Eric: At its most basic, the metaverse consists of a sense of immersion, real-time interactivity, and user agency. Consumers and companies are experimenting with the early metaverse for everything from socializing to fitness, commerce, virtual learning, and other daily activities. Like any technology, the metaverse is neither inherently good nor bad. It will be what we make it, and we can learn from previous eras of dramatic technological change. Why does it suddenly feel like it’s in the spotlight? Lareina: The metaverse is early and new and that means there’s a lot of creative freedom in how it evolves. But there’s also a lot of skepticism and challenges like data privacy and cybersecurity that need to be addressed. Practically, you have a very diverse set of use cases across industries. The complexity and excitement of the technology that underpins the metaverse is a whole source of renewal for innovation. Eric: There are similarities to the transition to Web 2.0 in 2004 that was sparked by social networks and user-generated content. Back then, people were busy imagining utopian visions of consumer control and the democratization of the internet. There’s a lot of excitement about the potential this technology holds, but the computing power isn’t there yet to make the metaverse of people’s imaginations feasible. That said, billions of dollars are flowing into every corner of metaverse infrastructure to help get it there. This ranges from back-end tech enablers like engines, blockchain, and hardware devices to platforms and virtual worlds. Across the board, capital is flowing in to make advances. What do consumers think about it? Eric: We surveyed more than 3,400 consumers around the world and found two-thirds are excited about transitioning everyday activities to the metaverse, especially when it comes to connecting with people, exploring virtual worlds, and collaborating with remote colleagues. Almost 60 percent of consumers prefer at least one activity in the immersive world versus the physical alternative. More surprisingly, 79 percent of consumers active in the metaverse have made a purchase. And how about executives? Lareina: Executives often don’t agree on very much, but our research shows they overwhelmingly agree on one thing: 95 percent of them believe the metaverse will have a positive impact on their industry. About a third of them think the metaverse can bring significant change in how their industry operates, and a quarter of them believe it will generate more than 15 percent of corporate revenue in the next five years. How big could this opportunity be? Eric: We expect the economic value of the metaverse to rise exponentially. Its appeal spans genders, geographies, sectors, and generations. Consumers are open to adopting new technologies; companies are investing heavily in the development of metaverse infrastructure; and brands experimenting in the metaverse are getting positive feedback from consumers. Our bottom-up view of consumer and enterprise use cases suggests it could generate up to $5 trillion in impact by 2030 — about the size of Japan’s economy, the world’s third-largest. How can the metaverse drive sustainable and inclusive growth? Eric: There’s an opportunity to reimagine public services and infrastructure in the metaverse. This opens new avenues to providing public services like education and healthcare, creating employment, and planning community spaces. We’re already seeing this, for example, with the government of Seoul, which plans to spend at least $32 million on a metaverse ecosystem to improve city services, planning, administration, and support for virtual tourism. Overall, one big challenge will be making sure the public sector talent base is well equipped to shape priorities for the greatest social good and to work with technology providers to make that happen. Lareina: There’s a lot of hope around the metaverse as an inclusive environment for creators, providers, and consumers. You can think about access and inclusion in the metaverse economy as something not for a few but for many. That creates a space to help democratize opportunities like learning, development, and education. Removing geographical barriers opens the doors to access in exciting new ways. What risks and broader implications should leaders plan for? Eric: How you think about digital trust in the metaverse is still to be defined. But there are urgent challenges that need to be considered. For one, there’s going to be a need to reskill part of the workforce to take advantage of, rather than compete with, the metaverse. And stakeholders will need to build a roadmap to make sure the metaverse experience is ethical, safe, and inclusive. This likely means creating guidelines around issues like data privacy, security, ethics, physical safety, sustainability, and equity. There’s a lot of promise and potential here, so long as these challenges are taken into account along the way. What is McKinsey doing for clients in this space? Lareina: We’re doing research to understand, share, and help companies demystify both the potential and the challenges of the metaverse. We’re also helping businesses with experimentation and business building. We help them on strategy, technology, and digital trust—not just how to conceive of a metaverse idea, but how to stand it up and operate it. Finally, what’s one thing every executive should be doing about the metaverse right now? Lareina: Be open-minded in terms of what some of the potential applications for your business might be. Have a long-term mindset. This is evolving. You’re not planning for an investment this quarter, you’re planning for a longer term trend. Eric: It’s a good idea for companies and executives to dip their toes into the metaverse experience to get a better sense of what it entails. There is no avoiding the fact that if you want to both understand consumers and opportunities that may be available to your organization, you need to be familiar with the metaverse . The best way for business leaders to explore is by becoming metaverse users themselves. related What is the metaverse? Why the recovery can’t be about “growth at all costs” Never miss a story"
New McKinsey center helps clients build capabilities in cell and gene therapy technology,"Our new Digital Capability Center, which has opened in Newark, New Jersey, serves clients in the life-sciences industry and helps biopharma companies optimize operations.",2022-06-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20digital%20capability%20center%20in%20nj%20preps%20life%20sciences%20for%20next%20wave%20of%20therapeutics/dccnj-hero-small-2people-1536x864.jpg,"Capability Building,Digital,Operations",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-digital-capability-center-in-nj-preps-life-sciences-for-next-wave-of-therapeutics,"New McKinsey center helps clients build capabilities in cell and gene therapy technology The Digital Capability Center New Jersey uses a mock autologous cell therapy manufacturing setup with authentic production equipment, where operators walk through the manufacturing process in a realistic setting. June 16, 2022 One of New Jersey ’ s fastest-growing industries is life sciences. Already home to some of the world’s largest biopharma companies, the state is now also home to our newest Digital Capability Center . Dedicated to life sciences with a focus on cell and gene therapies, the center was developed in partnership with the New Jersey Innovation Institute and is operated by BioCentriq. McKinsey operates 12 such facilities globally. They’re immersive learning environments where people can develop new skills by experimenting with digital technologies, explore new ways of working that will be critical to success, and plan the transformation of their operations both within and beyond their own walls. Cell and gene therapies are next-generation treatments for a number of diseases. Whereas traditional medicines often require repeated dosages, sometimes with negative side effects, these new therapies are individualized to the patient, offering potentially permanent benefits. In lay terms, cell and gene therapies restore, alter, or replace cells or genes in the body to prevent, treat, and sometimes cure diseases—some of which were previously incurable. Often, they are effective in a single dose. Digital Capability Centers for Operations Twenty-three gene therapies have been FDA-approved with promising results for treating diseases including blood cancers, hemophilia, congenital blindness, and spinal muscular atrophy, which is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. “Five years ago these treatments were really just ideas being tested in very small clinical trials,” explains McKinsey partner Katie Kelleher , who along with partner Andrea Gennari and a team of experts  established the center. “Now they are the fastest-growing area in therapeutics, and the industry is beginning to commercialize them. But they are very laborious, complex, and expensive to produce and many businesses aren’t ready to do this.” This is where the new Digital Capability Center can help. “As life-sciences companies everywhere are under pressure to hire talent and grow quickly, while improving quality and reliability,” says Andrea, “we can help them upskill people in operational excellence and transform their use of technology to enable new performance highs.” In particular, the new facility simulates the autologous CAR-T manufacturing process, a therapy used to treat cancer. In it, cells are taken out of a patient at a hospital, transported to a lab where they are purified and modified, and then injected back into that same patient. “It’s a complicated, weeks-long process requiring highly skilled technicians,” explains Emily Simon , a McKinsey solution manager. “For example, the cells have to be frozen in liquid nitrogen during transportation to ensure stasis.” A variety of demos in the lab show how digital technologies can improve effectiveness at different points of the process. One use case focuses on how to optimize yield through advanced analytics, which can increase output through more productive cell growth or greater cell viability in the lab. “Hundreds of factors can influence yield,” says Emily. “From the attributes of the raw materials—the serums and buffers that contain your cells—to the health of the patient who produced the cells, to factors of the process itself: temperature, pH, oxygen level.”  Predictive modelling using advanced analytics can help a lab technician forecast potential issues, identify root causes, and identify the ideal conditions for growing new replacement cells. When you see the digital technologies brought to life, you can truly grasp their full potential. In another use case, augmented- and virtual-reality technologies help train lab technicians in fundamental skills, such as changing cell-culture media. They can also be used to provide a refresher course for complex processes by practicing first with a virtual version of the equipment; this allows equipment and operators to stay focused on the actual production. The programs range from half-day workshops for leaders showcasing “what the future could be” to intensive four-day problem-solving, skill-building classes for teams undertaking a complete transformation. The center has already hosted several clients, creating moments of insight and impact that perhaps can only be realized in this cutting-edge, hands-on environment. “When you see the digital technologies brought to life,” a recent participant observed, “you can truly grasp their full potential.” related New Digital Capability Center in Italy prepares businesses for digital renaissance McKinsey launches new health initiative aiming to add “years to life and life to years” Never miss a story"
&ldquo;A rare opportunity.&rdquo; A non-binary transfeminine consultant makes their mark at McKinsey,"The face of the business world continues to evolve, and Danny Hurvitz is not only breaking the binary, but a barrier to inclusion for all gender expression in the workplace.",2022-06-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20rare%20opportunity%20a%20non%20binary%20transfeminine%20consultant%20makes%20their%20mark%20at%20mckinsey/pride-danny-hero-small-1325040531-1536x864.jpg,"Our People,Diversity",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-rare-opportunity-a-non-binary-transfeminine-consultant-makes-their-mark-at-mckinsey,"“A rare opportunity.” A non-binary transfeminine consultant makes their mark at McKinsey Danny Hurvitz works in our People and Organizational Performance practice, focusing on helping our clients with their diversity, equity, and inclusion transformations. June 29, 2022 The fullness of the gender spectrum is represented at McKinsey, and our work is richer for it. Danny Hurvitz joined the firm almost a year ago. Based in Chicago, they predominantly work in our People and Organizational Performance practice, focusing on helping our clients with their diversity, equity, and inclusion transformations. Danny ’s gender identity is non-binary, an umbrella term for gender identities that are outside of the binary—not solely male or female. They are also transfeminine, which means they are affirmed by their feminine side. (This is different than trans women, who are women.) Danny can typically be seen sporting earrings, makeup, nail polish, or other elements of traditionally feminine presentation. A non-binary transfemme identity can be challenging in a business setting. To those without knowledge of gender identity, a person such as Danny could be misperceived or mistreated. Danny is showing up as their authentic self and doing their job like everyone else but being effeminate often diminishes a person’s perceived power in a society that is still mostly heteronormative and male dominated. “Sometimes feedback I get is about being ‘sassy,’ which is similar to calling a woman ‘opinionated,’ something that is good for a man but seen as too aggressive for anyone else,” says Danny. “People don’t always know how to interact with me in a professional setting, and they aren’t necessarily conscious of it.” According to McKinsey research , trans people are twice as likely as cisgender people to be unemployed, earn less money even when they are as well qualified, and feel less supported at work and by their managers. More than half are not out at work. “Entering consulting, I had major concerns about if I would be safe and welcome,” says Danny, whose experience in business school suggested they were entering a field that had few people who are trans or gender non-conforming. “During recruiting, McKinsey was the only firm that could connect me with a trans employee. That made all the difference in my decision to come here.” That colleague was David DeLallo , who is a trans man and executive editor at McKinsey. While his experience is different from Danny’s, the conversation made Danny feel like they’d be welcome at McKinsey, even though they would become one of the first client-facing, openly non-binary trans-femme person at McKinsey. Since Danny was recruited in 2019 a number of other client-facing trans people have joined the firm. Danny’s experience since joining the firm has been positive overall but not without its growing pains. For instance, at the end of Danny’s summer internship at the firm, a survey to assess intern experience asked for gender identification and offered three options: male, female, and prefer not to disclose. “I emailed the survey creator and said, ‘I’d love to disclose my gender identity, but it’s not an available option,” Danny says. “I got a fast reply saying they had changed it. It was real allyship. I can’t tell you the number of times elsewhere I had to keep pushing to get change over the line.” Danny finds McKinsey to be an affirming place where the trans community is growing. An internal Slack channel for trans and gender non-conforming people started with a handful of people and now has several dozen. Past experiences have not felt as safe. Danny grew up outside Detroit and came out as gay at age 16, later identifying as queer. While their family and educational environment was supportive, opportunities for queer guidance or mentorship were lacking, which inspired Danny to become a teacher. In early experiences teaching first and third grade students, Danny was able to educate their students about queer people, even if initially receiving some difficult reactions. But when Danny relocated for family reasons, the situation changed. Students were quite hostile, and it became untenable to teach them. “A student had to be carried out of the room screaming at me for being gay,” says Danny. They left teaching and applied to business school while working for a nonprofit, where they found a community of trans people. This new support inspired Danny to embrace their femininity after years of trying to suppress it. It was revelatory for Danny, who finally understood how gender dysphoria had played a role in their life and the joy of living their true gender identity. When people talk about these issues, they are rarely talking about people like me. I wanted to change that. This knowledge gave them the strength and determination to push for greater recognition and respect. “There have been times when I felt entirely disrespected for who I am,” they say, “and this definitely affected my work.” But Danny fought for use of their correct pronouns and name (like many trans people, Danny changed their name), and triumphed over many challenges to pursue their career goals of working in diversity, equity, and inclusion. “There’s been a lot of progress on inclusion efforts, but so little of that is focused on the spectrum of gender diversity,” Danny says. “When people talk about these issues, they are rarely talking about people like me. I wanted to change that.” Today, their work at McKinsey centers on creating and leading workshops and individual coaching sessions to help organizations develop new DEI strategies, addressing their unique needs and challenges. They advise on employee resource groups, such as for LGBTQ people and people of color, and how organizations can recruit and retain a more diverse workforce and create an environment where everyone will thrive. Monne Williams , a partner who works with Danny, says that their identity offers a unique perspective for clients to learn from. “For many of our clients, it’s their first time working with someone gender non-conforming,” says Monne. “So not only do they see that it’s like working with anyone else, but they also have Danny who is so open and willing to have generous conversations about their experience. It’s a rare opportunity.” Never miss a story"
More than 700 new tech colleagues to join McKinsey in Atlanta,"By 2025, we will nearly double our tech workforce in Atlanta, rising from 800 to 1500 colleagues, and open a new Technology and Innovation Hub.",2022-07-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/700%20plus%20new%20tech%20colleagues%20to%20join%20mckinsey%20in%20atlanta/atltechtalent-hero-1327443336-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Our Offices",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/700-plus-new-tech-colleagues-to-join-mckinsey-in-atlanta,"More than 700 new tech colleagues to join McKinsey in Atlanta July 7, 2022 Atlanta is a storied city. It’s the birthplace of Coca Cola, was an epicenter of the American Civil Rights Movement, and is a leading hub of music, television, and film creation. For McKinsey—building on our 44-year history here—it’s our fastest growing location in the US. By 2025, we will expand our workforce from 800 to 1500, creating a new Technology and Innovation Hub that will join our recently re-launched Digital Capability Center there. This growth in technical expertise reflects the next wave of consulting innovation: using the latest in tech and analytics to better serve our clients. “Two years ago, we made a commitment to expand and create a modern and diverse tech workforce. We knew this would mean hiring hundreds of new colleagues,” says Steve Reis , a senior partner who led the Atlanta office for four years. “As we looked at cities across the globe, Atlanta had a magical mix of both diversity and a large pool of tech talent from nearby universities, including four historically Black colleges and universities.” In choosing Atlanta to make these investments, our firm is following an approach to increasing diversity that was covered in a recent McKinsey Quarterly article. The authors point out that Black workers are underrepresented in corporate roles beyond entry level, dropping from near parity to seven percent at the first promotion. They suggest businesses move to locations with a strong Black workforce rather than hoping Black talent will move to them. In Atlanta, 51 percent of the population is Black. The city is also home to other underrepresented groups that offer opportunities for companies to increase the diversity of their workforces. Spanish and Korean are the second and third most common languages, for example, and the city boasts a vibrant LGBTQ community. Tiffany Burns is the senior partner who leads the Atlanta office today. “You will see and hear this difference between Atlanta and other cities the moment you arrive at the airport,” she says. The Tech and Innovation Hub brings together two McKinsey groups: the Client Capabilities Network and the Tech Ecosystem. The Client Capabilities Network is made up of industry and functional experts who support clients, both in person and remotely, with solutions, frameworks and diagnostics. “Our people can come in at different points during a project to do targeted analyses and due diligence,” explains Robert Tesoriero , leader of the network. “These repeated, sophisticated analyses provide a fact base, accelerate results, and support our integrative consultants in strategizing and co-creation with clients.” The Tech Ecosystem, according to their chief operating officer Leslie Giordano brings together a range of technical experts who conceive, build, and run our firm’s digital capabilities. “They focus on cloud, security, and maximizing the effectiveness of the technologies we use as a firm and with our clients,” she explains. Aligning tech and consulting in one location gives us the opportunity to deeply integrate and bring the best of our firm to our clients. The newly expanded Digital Capability Center in Atlanta, formally re-launched this May , is a state-of-the-art facility that helps companies build expertise and capabilities they need to adopt next generation digital technologies. The Atlanta office also features a McKinsey Design-to-Value lab that helps clients improve the performance of products and services. “Aligning tech and consulting in one location,"" says Tiffany, “gives us the opportunity to deeply integrate and bring the best of our firm to our clients.” So what can a new colleague expect if they join McKinsey Atlanta? Tremendous apprenticeship opportunities to help them develop quickly as professionals, and the support and friendship of welcoming communities through our affinity groups . “We have teams focused on sustainability, building businesses, working with organizations to upskill and reskill their people, and helping with transformations across a variety of industries and functions,” says Tiffany. “So, what we can offer colleagues is the chance to do exciting work on issues that people are passionate about.” Learn more about jobs in Atlanta related Why sponsorship is key to helping Black employees advance—and more takeaways from our new research A first step to racial equality? “Fundamentally improve job quality.” Never miss a story"
McKinsey&rsquo;s new parental leave program supports inclusive career advancement,The revamped policy expands firmwide parental leave in most regions and offers a re-integration program for career growth.,2022-07-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinseys%20new%20parental%20leave%20program%20drives%20inclusive%20career%20advancement/parentalleave-hero-small-jac-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinseys-new-parental-leave-program-drives-inclusive-career-advancement,"McKinsey’s new parental leave program supports inclusive career advancement Jacqueline Carey, senior recruiter based in Boston, with her wife, newborn daughter, and corgi. Jacqueline was surprised to learn she’d be returning from her parental leave to a promotion. July 12, 2022 Not long after Sarah Kleinman , a partner at McKinsey, came back from her maternity leave, she got the chance to help pilot and develop a new re-boarding program at the firm for partners returning from parental leave. That re-boarding pilot became the seed of a newly expanded global parental leave policy for all colleagues launched this spring. It extends firmwide parental leave in most regions and includes a re-integration program to help ensure returning colleagues can maintain their career growth, rather than having to play catchup. Research shows women in the workplace overall tend to feel more negative consequences when they take leave, with 20 percent of women surveyed saying their leave had an adverse impact on their career, compared to 10 percent of men. McKinsey encourages all firm members, especially leaders at the partner and senior partner level, to make the most of leave benefits. In the last senior partner-elect class, 48 percent took parental leave while at the firm and 49 percent of the women elected in the latest partner cycle had also taken parental leave. The pilot program Sarah participated in takes this support a step further. “When you return from extended leave, especially as a partner, it can feel like you have to start from scratch rebuilding your client base. For some people, that can be an anxious and lonely experience,” she says. “We wanted to figure out: How can we give people more support so they know the firm has their back and really believes in them?” Working closely with Gretchen Berlin , head of our diversity, equity and inclusion programs for North America, and Nadine Ray , director of partner programs, Sarah first took a look at how she wanted to best spend her time at the firm and what her career goals were now that she was back from leave. She knew she wanted to invest in building client relationships in particular, and together with Gretchen and Nadine, developed a proposal for what that might look like. “I presented that proposal and got a group of senior partners engaged,” she says. “A program like this rallies everyone around your aspirations in order to support you in your transition back.” The re-boarding program is now being extended to firm members around the world. This includes extended time to bond with and care for a new infant for parents who have given birth and all other parents. It also includes added re-boarding benefits like a re-integration plan and one-on-one support, coaching, and support for a phased return to client work. The new support has been heartily welcomed by parents across the firm, who have cherished that time with their newborns. Associate partner Whitney Zimmerman , who is based in the United Kingdom, heard the news after returning from leave. Having recently taken three months after his daughter’s birth by adding on his paid time off, he is an advocate for new fathers taking full advantage of the extended benefit. “I feel privileged that I could take three months to support my wife and daughter,” he says. “I know the full leave isn’t always taken by every dad, and I think it’s important for new parents to feel empowered to take that time.” Jacqueline Carey , a recruiter in North America, was surprised to get a call partway through her maternity leave, letting her know that when she would be returning to work, it would be to a promotion as senior recruiter. For Jacqueline, the opportunity came at a time when new parents often feel they’ve been sidelined from their careers. “I always knew I wouldn’t be dinged for taking maternity leave, but I didn’t think I would actually be promoted,” says Jacqueline. “There are a lot of biases against working parents and that just wasn’t the case here.” A program like this rallies everyone in line with your aspirations in order to support you in your transition back. A senior recruiter with GLAM , McKinsey’s LGBTQ+ network, Jacqueline said she and her wife felt supported at every step along the way of deciding to have a baby, which for same-sex couples is often a more complicated process involving multiple medical procedures, all of which were fully covered for her by the firm’s health benefits. “In many workplaces, the benefits for same sex couples are not acknowledged,” she says. “For me, the culture around parenthood felt very supportive here. My being a mother is acknowledged and valued by my team.” The same goes for all new parents at McKinsey. “Becoming a working parent isn't an easy transition, which is why I’m proud that we're able to make the 'working' part as easy as possible,” says our chief diversity and inclusion officer Maria del Mar Martinez . “We hope these changes allow parents to focus on family— then successfully return to doing the work they love.” Never miss a story"

Having better data transparency, insights into potential decarbonization levers, and the ability to create a comprehensive plan and track progress against it are all fundamental elements to enable leaders to decide where to begin—and know which moves will pay off. Recognizing this issue, McKinsey has sought to deliver a distinctive digital solution to drive change. Today we’re pleased to announce the official launch of Catalyst Zero , our end-to-end decarbonization solution that helps clients find and remove carbon from their business operations. “Catalyst Zero brings together McKinsey’s sustainability expertise, sector-specific technical knowledge, and proven transformation experience,” says McKinsey senior partner Tolga Oguz . “We work with companies across all sectors, and at all stages of maturity, to accelerate their sustainability journey.” Catalyst Zero combines our firm’s proven business-transformation approach with advanced technology to help clients establish their carbon footprint, evaluate their decarbonization options, set ambitious targets, and manage execution progress while tracking impact of their actions. Through a digital platform that pairs decarbonization decisions with broader business goals, we give leaders a powerful new way to compare side by side the expected monetary and emission reduction impacts of various interventions—and choose what’s best for them. Catalyst Zero uses an end-to-end digital user interface, industry leading data, and the best of McKinsey’s deep decarbonization knowledge. It allows users to create an accurate and comprehensive view of emissions and match emissions to decarbonization levers through our AI-driven mapping engine. By doing so Catalyst Zero can quickly give management the ability to create a comprehensive plan to meet their company’s decarbonization goals. “This solution can help companies remove carbon at the company, product, and value-chain levels,” says McKinsey senior partner Dr. Ruth Heuss . “Our technology helps clients clearly see the key drivers of emission and our people help them create decarbonization plans that are tailored to their organizations.” Catalyst Zero is one of our most powerful tools for shaping clients’ decarbonization transformations Companies that have used Catalyst Zero are already seeing impact. One global company, for example, used Catalyst Zero to determine which of its nearly 300 manufacturing sites emit the most CO 2 . This has enabled them to create a plan to rapidly reduce emissions by 27 percent. In another case, Catalyst Zero helped a global retailer working with more than 800 suppliers reduce both costs and emissions by 200 million metric tons of CO 2 . “To transition towards a sustainable future, businesses need to reset their strategy, asset allocation, and operating models over time,” says McKinsey senior partner Thomas Hundertmark . “They need transparency on available benchmarks and levers. And they need a performance engine to track progress. Catalyst Zero is one of our most powerful tools for shaping clients’ decarbonization transformations.” related McKinsey launches new climate technology effort to accelerate decarbonization Never miss a story"

Every job is an opportunity to develop skills that can lead to a better position. A waitress manages people while multi-tasking, fitting experience for customer service. An inventory clerk observes first-hand the complexities of juggling logistics in a warehouse. An IT person on the help desk masters the basics of managing a network. Human capital at work: The value of experience Our team of researchers analyzed 700 occupations across four countries and found that skills acquired through work experience account for 40 to 43 percent of average lifetime earnings in the US, UK, and Germany, and 56 percent of earnings in India. “What this means is that y ou’re not limited to a low-earning bracket simply because of your level of education or lack of personal and professional networks. This is a story of possibilities,” explains MGI partner Anu Madgavkar , who led the research with Bill Schaninger, a McKinsey senior partner in our People & Organizational Performance Practice. But it takes a willingness to try new jobs, including at your current employer. In our sample, workers switched roles an average of every two to four years, increasing their skill set by about 25 percent with each move.  And those who made bold moves early on and more frequently saw the greatest increase in earnings. “You have to try something new that stretches you,” says Bill. “You don’t know if it’s going to work. You build on that stretch. Repeat. And that’s the essence of it really. You have to say, ‘Surely, there’s more than this’—and even be willing to fail miserably.” He is speaking from experience. Following an early stint in academia, Bill joined McKinsey as an associate in London. “In the first weeks, I was convinced I had made a massive mistake. I was so bad at top-down communications and problem solving,” he remembers. “But each time I moved to a new role, I improved my skills, always building on what I had just learned.” Changing jobs requires energy and resilience, and higher education institutions can better prepare their young people, says Anu. “They can take the perspective that they are growing ‘future employees,’ not just graduating students,” she suggests, “and double down on life skills such as critical thinking, public speaking, how to engage and influence others, how to be a systems thinker, and—most importantly—how to cultivate a constant learning mindset.” If companies can adjust some of their people processes and approaches to management, Anu adds, they can attract top talent by offering their employees opportunities for continuous growth and mobility. It starts with recruiting. “In addition to focusing on skills, they should widen their scope and look for personality, adaptability, curiosity,” she points out. “And once hired, coaching and mentoring new employees is especially important in the first year.” Those who become known as ‘learning organizations’ will ultimately attract and retain the best talent, their single most important resource. With the right analytics and processes in place, businesses can quantify both their employees’ current skills and attributes and their longer-term potential to grow—information that’s often scattered in performance reviews, informal communications, and sometimes in the heads of supervisors or colleagues. Companies have an opportunity to establish and communicate a full and flexible array of different learning pathways both within and outside the organization. They can even celebrate when someone leaves—and communicate that they are welcome to return in the future with deeper skills. “For some businesses, this will be a different paradigm and a lot of work,” observes Anu. “But those who become known as ‘learning organizations’ will ultimately attract and retain the best talent, their single most important resource.” “Today, when a young person asks me for advice on how to manage a career in such a dynamic environment, I tell them to go for the experience, not the compensation,” says Bill. Anu agrees. “Twice I’ve made lateral moves for the experience,” she says. “When I joined McKinsey, people in my former profession didn’t understand why I would leave. But I believed it was the chance of a lifetime to join an organization where I could learn from the best.” related Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech The Great Attrition is making hiring harder.

This effort brings together governments, local communities, Indigenous Peoples, and funders to develop accountable, actionable, and science-based conservation plans that create opportunities for sustainable economic growth. Central to this approach is Project Finance for Permanence, an innovative and proven model that fully funds conservation efforts to ensure durable and scalable impact. McKinsey is contributing to this model through the analysis and optimization of socioeconomic impact, identifying sustainable financing mechanisms, and enabling access to carbon markets. To date, nearly 90 million hectares across five nations have been conserved with the goal of protecting another 600 million hectares across 20 nations by 2030. We spoke with McKinsey partner Duko Hopman , who works closely with Enduring Earth, about how and why sustainable conservation efforts impact our planet and communities. How did you first get interested in conservation? As is the case for many clients I work with, it’s been a lifelong passion of mine. I was passionate about nature and conservation from the age of 4 or 5 years old. I was a member of the World Wildlife Fund’s “rangers,” where every weekend we would go into the woods and do what, in our minds then, was very important conservation work in the forest. I studied biology in my undergraduate studies. And I’ve tried to make conservation part of the work I do since my early days at the firm. Early on, I worked on anti-poaching efforts with governments in Africa and nature conservation strategies for Central Asian countries. And now I’m thrilled to be able to focus on important conservation projects like Enduring Earth and the Blue Nature Alliance . The global nature crisis, though just as important, gets less awareness and action than the climate crisis. Tell us more about this. First of all, the climate crisis and global nature crisis are incredibly interdependent. Nature degradation accelerates climate change, and climate change accelerates the loss of ecosystems. But the nature crisis is also devastating in its own right. There are estimates we are using up what amounts to 1.8 planet earths through habitat destruction, pollution, and the impacts of over-fishing and industrial activity. Obviously, we only have one planet. We have lost 68 percent of wildlife populations in the last 50 years. There are many people just like me who feel very passionate about preserving these incredibly beautiful ecosystems, but there are also economic reasons to care about this. Close to half of the world’s GDP is reliant on nature and intact ecosystems. You can see that in action with some of the clients I work with. Collapsing fish stocks are affecting people in coastal areas. Deforestation, which affects rainfall, threatens crops and our food systems. Remote local communities who rely heavily on nature suffer the consequences most directly. What can we do about it? In the past, a “fortress conservation” approach was common -- put a fence around an area and kick everyone out of it. That’s a very non-inclusive and violent way to conserve an area, and it’s also ineffective because you’re pushing out people who have deep ties to, and are stewards of, the land. That is the absolute opposite of what Enduring Earth is doing. Instead, it’s asking the question: How can we partner with local people and strengthen their stewardship of their land and waters? It’s about working with communities on how we can build a sustainable and highly inclusive economy that creates better conservation outcomes. Tell us more about Project Finance for Permanence. Traditionally, many conservation projects and programs around the world struggle annually to figure out the best way to protect an area and fund that preservation. But a short-term approach to conservation -- especially when it comes to funding -- can be risky. In difficult economic times or when there are funding disruptions, support for conservation can struggle. As a result, ecosystems get degraded and it’s very hard to build that back. That’s why keeping ecosystems intact requires a long-term, perhaps even a permanent approach. The approach closely follows the project financing methodology commonly used in large infrastructure projects. It ensures all funding and pre-conditions for success are committed in a single deal moment, before funding is released. That means the commitments of one stakeholder, say a government, can then leverage the commitments of others, like philanthropists or the private sector, and vice versa. Early community buy-in and involvement is a very important part of the process. Communities are in the driver’s seat every step of the way. The result is funding in perpetuity and the right technical assistance for ecosystems to thrive at scale. Some of the PFPs we work on with Enduring Earth are tens of millions of hectares—the size of some countries. What’s McKinsey’s role in all of this? We partner closely with the Blue Nature Alliance and Enduring Earth to provide analytics and other support to inform decision making. For example, we analyze proposed conservation efforts to see which type of funding mechanisms can be designed or accessed for long-term funding. We look at a range of potential options and models, from accessing global carbon markets to innovative bond issuances. We also analyze the potential socioeconomic benefits of conservation efforts, and what needs to be in place to maximize those benefits. Take for example, the number of community jobs created through sustainable fisheries. All of this fits in the context of McKinsey’s ambition to be catalytic in the world’s transition to become both carbon net zero and nature positive. We help provide the data and insights that illustrate for stakeholders how these ambitious programs fit into a broader context of sustainability targets. How, for example, does a Project Finance for Permanence that includes the conservation of large coastal mangrove systems contribute to a country’s climate change mitigation strategy? All of this fits in the context of McKinsey’s ambition to be catalytic in the world’s transition to become both carbon net zero and nature positive. Conservation has an incredibly important role to play in this as does our work with corporations and countries on their journeys to become nature positive. What excites you most about the future of conservation work? More than 100 countries have committed to the target of 30x30 proposed by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity to conserve 30 percent of the earth’s land and marine area by 2030. This commitment is an incredible step, but it’s not just political will that makes this happen. It needs to be matched by technical expertise and funding coming together. I’m very happy McKinsey can help with that. There’s potential for huge impact and I’m excited for us to be involved. related Can data science turn ocean conservation dreams into reality?

An explicit choice: Three leaders on making the decision to grow,"McKinsey leaders share stories about how the pursuit of sustainable, inclusive, and profitable growth can elevate business performance and inspire people.",2022-08-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/an-explicit-choice-three-leaders-on-making-the-decision-to-grow,"An explicit choice: Three leaders on making the decision to grow August 16, 2022 Our recent research, “ Choosing to grow: The leader’s blueprint ,” finds that about a quarter of companies don’t grow at all, and just one in eight achieved more than 10 percent revenue growth annually between 2010 and 2019. Sustainable, inclusive, and profitable growth requires leaders to make an explicit choice, our authors write—and those who choose growth generate 80 percent more shareholder value than their peers over a ten-year period. Beyond creating shareholder value, our research finds that growth attracts talent, fosters innovation, and creates jobs. Here, three authors of our new report share their experiences working with growth leaders and the challenges and wins along the way. How an energy incumbent avoided stagnation by choosing sustainable growth We’d been working with an energy incumbent that had been in a stagnant growth state: Their core commodities business faced challenges in achieving transformative growth, and they needed to embark on expanding beyond the core to adjacent business opportunities. But this was challenging for a couple of reasons: The new venture required capabilities and talent the organization didn’t have—and it wouldn’t be profitable for years. Still, the client knew that the move was necessary—all market signals pointed to that need, and they feared falling behind competitors who could move faster. The transition also reflected their values: If one of the largest energy companies wouldn’t move on critical changes needed to reach global decarbonization efforts, who should do it? We’re now working with the client to create an ecosystem to support this transition, partnering with insurance companies, original equipment manufacturers, and others. Through this process, the client has also developed new knowledge and capabilities to make their core business stronger. - Tjark Freundt , senior partner, Hamburg How a leader stopped paying lip service to growth—and made a bold investment in innovation We’ve been working with a new CEO in the financial services industry who said they were focused on growth—even as they were allocating the same budget to the growth service line as they were to the core business. As we discuss in the article, this was another example of not making an explicit choice to grow and executing accordingly. Recently, the CEO changed their mindset and made an intentional choice to double down on the growth service line. They were partly inspired by a conversation with a fellow CEO—and they had settled into their role a little more and became more comfortable in making these bolder moves. The CEO asked the leader of the growth service line what they needed, and allocated all the resources requested. In fact, the organization is now exploring how to accelerate a second growth service line that’s adjacent to the core. - Jill Zucker , senior partner, New York How a CEO aligned aspiration, investment, and people to unlock growth We had a client conversation that began—like many others—with a request for growth. The company had a strong portfolio and was churning out hundreds of products a year. However, that activity was only filling declines in revenue from previous years. If it continued to go this way, the client would not have the funds nor the people to run fast enough to fill revenue gaps and grow the top line. Additionally, there was an attitude of, “Oh, we’ll just innovate more products incrementally to meet immediate customer needs and that would be enough,’” which is a fairly common mistake. We mapped out a growth model that would help the CEO reach a bigger aspiration, and then we asked: “Are you bold enough to really pursue this path?” The CEO acknowledged it was a lot more change than he thought it would be, and while the organization aspired to be an industry leader, the investment behind that goal wasn’t there. This realization became the catalyst for a mindset shift for the CEO, who ultimately aligned the management team on the new path forward. The leadership team agreed to breakout growth and the work required to achieve it—including each executive offering funds and the people from their own function—was more valuable than any other alternative. Success required the commitment of the entire management team to pursue the new growth agenda. We partnered with them to map out the most exciting and valuable opportunities while they rewired their marketing and commercial capabilities to strengthen their core business in parallel. It was an 18-month journey with substantial performance and cultural impact. - Erik Roth , senior partner, Stamford related Why the recovery can’t be about “growth at all costs” Never miss a story"
A relief effort accelerates and expands: The story behind 2.3 million saved meals,What began as a pro-bono effort to help vulnerable families during Ramadan amid the COVID-19 pandemic is now a full-fledged initiative to reduce food waste and insecurity across the Middle East and beyond.,2022-08-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/from%20relief%20to%20repurposing%20the%20story%20behind%202%203%20million%20saved%20meals/10milmeals-hero-small-box-1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/from-relief-to-repurposing-the-story-behind-2-3-million-saved-meals,"A relief effort accelerates and expands: The story behind 2.3 million saved meals August 22, 2022 A third of the world’s food is wasted annually, but saving and repurposing just half of that waste would feed nearly all undernourished people globally. This lopsided equation—and the painful reality it represents for many—became the impetus for action for a group of McKinsey colleagues in the Middle East Office in April 2020. At the time, the devastating effects of COVID-19 were unfolding fast around the world, disrupting lives in countless ways. With Ramadan just weeks away, our colleagues knew that many families in the region would have difficulty securing food for the month. “It was a really scary time, where a lot of people were facing challenges,” says Reem Mouazzen Alyawer, a senior associate in McKinsey’s Middle East Office. “We knew we had to help however we could.” Reem and our colleagues partnered with the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives and sought to deliver 10 million meals throughout the month of Ramadan. The campaign well exceeded its goal, delivering 15.3 million meals across the United Arab Emirates in 2020. “It was amazing and so inspiring to see how all the community members just came together,” says Reem. “And that was just the start of this incredible journey.” A year later, the effort scaled to deliver more than 216 million meals—more than double their goal—to more than 30 countries, helping vulnerable communities in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. It became—and remains the biggest food donation drive in the region. “I feel blessed and very grateful that I had the chance to be a part of this team because it was the kind of work that led to impact that was very real for so many people,” says Ali Baqueri, a senior associate. This spring, the team continued their efforts for a third year, alongside Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives and the UAE Food Bank to deliver a further one million meals, either saved or repurposed. Our colleagues built on the sustainability effort, partnering with supermarkets, retail chains, hotels, and restaurants to repurpose food items that were near expiration and would otherwise be thrown out. They also worked with hotels and restaurants with excess food, especially during Ramadan. Elsewhere, hotel and restaurant kitchen leftovers were recycled into compost that was then donated to farms across the UAE. “I was inspired to see that we could distribute more than 50,000 meals each day from food that would otherwise have gone to waste,” says Martijn Leenhouts, a senior implementation expert. “Once we saw that impact, we knew we wanted to make this a standing effort.” To ensure an efficient and effective system, the team developed a digital tool that manages the ecosystem of food suppliers and partners, including a dashboard for tracking the number of meals packaged and delivered, and the number of vulnerable individuals and families who received the meals. Ultimately, these efforts led to a total 2.3 million meals saved and donated in 2022, again doubling the outcome of our original goal. One million saved meals “I’m grateful to be a part of this project and be reminded daily that what you take for granted can make a huge difference for someone else,” says junior associate Batool Aljufairi. “Food waste is an ongoing problem, and my hope is for our communities to continue to repurpose excess food beyond the month of Ramadan.” That effort is already underway. McKinsey is now working with the UAE Food Bank to develop its strategy and design clear initiatives to take its mandate to the next level. And hopefully, bring a little more balance to that lopsided equation. related Through education and cricket, building hope among Middle East refugees Never miss a story"
McKinsey and Microsoft join forces to accelerate decarbonization transformations,Companies are working to meet ambitious net-zero targets. But they haven’t had the right technology to help them achieve these targets quickly and at scale—until now.,2022-09-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20and%20microsoft%20join%20forces%20to%20accelerate%20decarbonization%20transformations/msftcloud-hero-small-1346415763-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-and-microsoft-join-forces-to-accelerate-decarbonization-transformations,"McKinsey and Microsoft join forces to accelerate decarbonization transformations September 12, 2022 Organizations driving towards net-zero often face a major impediment—the lack of an efficient, scalable technology solution. To calculate their organization’s overall carbon footprint, build a robust decarbonization plan, and execute it with confidence and transparency, leaders need technology that can rival the challenge. To address this, Microsoft and McKinsey have joined forces to create an integrated solution that combines sustainability data intelligence from Microsoft Sustainability Manager with decarbonization planning and an execution engine using McKinsey Sustainability’s Catalyst Zero . This technological collaboration will enhance companies’ sustainability transformations by integrating their data from activities that produce emissions with initiatives to abate them. Powered by Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, this combined solution uses Sustainability Manager to automate and scale the collection of companies’ sustainability-related data and support establishing an emission baseline. Following that, McKinsey’s Catalyst Zero solution, which draws on our sustainability expertise and proven transformation experience, provides a holistic understanding of emissions at company, product and value chain levels, and helps leaders create a detailed decarbonization plan by leveraging a vast proprietary library of decarbonization levers. Creating value beyond the hype During execution, the ongoing data feed between Microsoft’s and McKinsey’s solutions regularly monitors whether the impact forecasted in the decarbonization plan is happening as planned. This creates confidence in the decarbonization impact achieved and transparency for all stakeholders, including clients, consumers, shareholders, and regulators. The joint solution is powered with tens of thousands of emission factors and decarbonization levers across 70+ industry sectors to rapidly quantify baseline emissions, generate a company-specific Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC), and finally plan and track granular decarbonization initiatives. “We are focused on accelerating progress to achieve a more sustainable future, and our collaboration with McKinsey, to deliver innovative Cloud for Sustainability solutions will help customers unify their data intelligence, build robust IT infrastructure and gain insights into their overall carbon footprint in order to help them develop and execute robust decarbonization strategies to achieve their sustainability goals.” says Elisabeth Brinton, Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Sustainability. Catalyst Zero: Accelerating decarbonization transformations at scale “Urgent and decisive action to curtail emissions is needed if we are to reach net zero by 2050,” says Tomas Nauclér, senior partner at McKinsey and global co-leader of McKinsey Sustainability. “By combining our tech and sustainability expertise and experience, Microsoft and McKinsey will help businesses accurately and swiftly measure and reduce their overall carbon footprint.” By combining our tech and sustainability expertise and experience, Microsoft and McKinsey will help businesses accurately and swiftly measure and reduce their overall carbon footprint. Microsoft and McKinsey have a long and successful history of collaborating to accelerate and scale client impact. Over the past three years alone, the two organizations have worked together to help clients de-risk transformations, redesign business processes through data and analytics, and build new digital businesses. These collaborations span across industries and include, for example, a technology transformation for a wireless-equipment manufacturer that achieved a 125 percent increase in output and tripled build speed, or technological innovations for a real estate company to mitigate COVID-19 risk for employees returning to the office. Our two companies look forward to building on this history of collaboration of proven successes as we enter the next horizon of this alliance. related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story"
McKinsey launches new Sustainable Materials Hub to accelerate the net-zero transition across value chains,"Companies utilizing steel, cement, and more have pledged to reach net zero—but face major challenges. Our new hub will meet the urgency and promise of the moment.",2022-09-13T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20launches%20new%20sustainable%20materials%20hub/susthub-hero-fullwidth-building-1280x497.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-launches-new-sustainable-materials-hub,"McKinsey launches new Sustainable Materials Hub to accelerate the net-zero transition across value chains September 13, 2022 Metals, cement, batteries, glass, plastics, and more account for nearly 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. To arrest the rise in global temperatures, the materials sector must radically decarbonize. Meeting this moment requires the value chain to cooperate as never before and solve a complex chicken-egg problem. For example, if upstream producers, such as steel suppliers, don’t decarbonize, then downstream producers, such as car manufacturers, won’t have the low-carbon materials they need to reach their sustainability targets. At the same time, however, upstream producers can’t decarbonize without clear downstream demand for sustainable materials. McKinsey’s Sustainable Materials Hub aims to help solve this problem and accelerate the materials transition. The new initiative offers an approach that combines upstream and downstream perspectives to find joint solutions for materials sustainability—and create value while doing so. In fact, we estimate that nearly $9 to 12 trillion will reside in new sustainable value pools by 2030 , including about $300 billion in new green materials and the products they enable . “This is a system-level opportunity,” says partner Anna Moore . “Making the most of it requires the value chain to work together; supply and demand need to come together. We’ve launched the Sustainable Materials Hub in order to help our clients develop integrated perspectives, commitments, and concrete action plans.” The new hub combines decades of functional expertise in sustainability and operations with deep perspectives across commodities and industries to help reduce materials emissions from production through sourcing to use. “We house experts at every step of the value chain,” says partner Eric Hannon , “from miners, smelters, processers, and distributors, to end purchasers, equipment manufacturers, and industrial players.” The hub also offers in-depth insights on the supply, demand, and low-carbon premiums across a wide range of commodities. “Capabilities that until today existed in multiple pockets of the firm are now coming together to build holistic, uniquely-effective solutions for decarbonization,” says senior partner Michel Van Hoey . “That’s the power of the hub.” The Sustainable Materials Hub will focus on several areas: Creating transparency on materials related to GHG emissions; Defining realistic materials-related decarbonization aspirations and developing practical decarbonization plans to achieve these; Commercializing sustainable materials; and developing future-proof sourcing strategies for low carbon offerings. These areas will give our clients the opportunity to address decarbonization opportunities through an ecosystem approach, helping put leaders in the best possible position to pursue emissions reductions boldly, and ensure they thrive in the green transformation. “Most players will have to find ways to work across the value chain,” associate partner Anna-Christina Fredershausen says. “They can’t do this in a silo and get where they want to go. That’s why in the new hub we’ve organized ourselves the way we have.” To cut across verticals and break down silos, the hub will leverage McKinsey’s distinctive tools, such as Catalyst Zero , to help clients take a fact-based perspective on decarbonization. Capabilities that until today existed in multiple pockets of the firm are now coming together to build holistic, uniquely-effective solutions for decarbonization. That’s the power of the hub. The hub will also help clients reskill and upskill the people who touch these verticals, ensuring the impact we deliver, and the decarbonization work we catalyze, can endure. Associate partner Yvonne Huemer explains: “If sourcing teams buy products for manufacturing that are high carbon or commercial teams sell solutions but don’t capture the value of lower-carbon offerings, you’re not advancing,” she says. “Every function in producer- and purchaser-organizations needs to be upskilled, and we can help.” Reaching net-zero by 2050 is the imperative of our time. The Sustainable Materials Hub is our latest move to help accelerate progress toward it. “Whenever we go to a materials player and do an end-to-end assessment, we always find levers that reduce carbon and create value,” says associate partner Marcelo Azevedo , “When clients want to move, we can tell them exactly where to go and how to get there.” related Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero Never miss a story"

Yet, diversity without equitable and inclusive work environments leads to challenges for people of color, often hidden to managers and colleagues, that can inhibit performance. When an employee is the only, or one of few, from their identity group, they carry a daily burden of representation on top of systemic inequities they face in their broader careers. These can hinder advancement and take a personal toll. After George Floyd’s murder, McKinsey announced 10 Actions toward racial equity. This included creating Black Leadership Academy, which comprises leadership development programs with customized content relevant to Black leaders, to support leaders and equip them with skills, capabilities, and networks to accelerate their trajectory. A year later, based on participant feedback, the program expanded to create content relevant for Asian and Latino and Hispanic leaders and became Connected Leaders Academy . “We created a program that takes a 360 view of support and advancement,” says senior Michael Park , who leads McKinsey’s People & Organizational Performance practice. “We’re supporting the individual directly, through their organization and through an alumni network.” Targeting support across career levels CLA started with two levels: Executive Leadership Program , for senior executives, and Management Accelerator , for mid-career managers. In July, we added Leadership Essentials for early career leaders. This program addresses the broken rung , the juncture before manager where women and people of color tend to lose ground, making advancement more challenging. “Organizations see leaders of color and women dropping off in their first move from entry level to manager,” says associate partner Ankur Kumar , who is a leader of Connected Leaders Academy. “This is a chance for us to support talent pipelines end to end.” To date, more than 850 organizations have participated in the no-cost, virtual programs, enrolling upwards of 35,000 employees over the last two years. Ninety six percent of participants rated the program as a high value, and 95 percent said they would recommend it. Collaborating with organizations The academy is dedicated to a driving a major shift toward building more diverse talent pipelines. The program is open to organizations whether they are McKinsey clients or not. “We want to move beyond the organizations that typically know McKinsey and support progression of leaders across an ever-expanding universe of companies and people,” says partner Ingrid Millán , who leads the Hispanic and Latino Leadership Academy. Participating companies identify a program champion, usually from DEI or HR teams, who works on nominations and applications, supports their employees, and liaises with Connected Leaders Academy. “We’re counseling organizations and ideating with them to build the ‘ surround sound’ support leaders need as part of the experience,” says Ankur. “It’s a deep collaboration.” Creating psychological safety It takes ongoing work to be inclusive. Sometimes that means giving identity groups their own space and opportunities to build community. “One thing is true for Black professionals—you are almost always at a table where few people who look like you have sat,” says partner Sara Prince , a leader of Connected Leaders Academy and our global 10 Actions lead. “Connected Leaders Academy brings professionals together to address executive leadership concepts without requiring they translate their personal identity for others and that is powerful—and can accelerate careers.” Professional development with customized content relevant to identity-based experience gives participants a rare freedom in learning. “You’re in a group of leaders who look like you. The vulnerability, the authenticity, the psychological safety, those are things that pop from the beginning,” says Ankur. Building long-term change The psychological safety built into the sessions is hard earned. To keep program graduates on track for upward mobility, the academy created a robust alumni network called NEXT. For Ingrid, the network is perhaps the most vital part of the program. “The word we hear most often to describe the alumni network is ‘unparalleled,’” she says. While too many Hispanic and Latino professionals are still the ‘only’ at work, the CLA alumni network makes sure they aren’t growing and stretching alone. This is especially important for those who may be the first in their family to be a business leader.” The shift is happening before our very eyes, and it’s a privilege to be part of it. The program works to ensure lasting change isn’t just on these leaders to deliver—the organizations are there with them. Ankur spends time counseling the program champions around building inclusion lessons into the broader organization. “The dedication from the companies collaborating through CLA is palpable. It gives me a lot of hope, seeing this change in hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals,” Ankur says. “The shift is happening before our very eyes and it’s a privilege to be part of it.” related How we’re building the next generation of Black executive leaders Never miss a story"

She was very excited about her career move, but things didn’t go as planned. “Somewhere in my second year, I had a confidence crisis,” she explains. “I had started a different role in a new environment and my inner voice kept telling me I wasn’t good enough; I was out of my comfort zone.” Jacqueline had always experienced low-grade anxiety but now it reached a new level. “I would freeze in meetings, work harder and harder to compensate, and ultimately began having secret panic attacks,” she recalls. “Finally, there came a moment when I said: ‘Enough! I cannot hide this. I’m going to talk about it.’” So she did talk to colleagues and friends. Reactions ranged from “Thank goodness someone is finally acknowledging this; we all are secretly struggling” to “Don’t talk too much about this; it’s best to keep it private.” But she kept on sharing her experiences, started researching the topic, and pursued an additional medical degree in affective neuroscience. In 2015, she partnered with Nick Van Dam , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and IE University who led learning at McKinsey and is now a senior advisor to the firm, and Arjen van Witteloostuijn , dean of the School of Business and Economics of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, to write a book called Advancing Authentic Confidence through Emotional Flexibility . A second updated English edition will be published in September 2022. Today, Jacqueline is McKinsey’s chief scientist and director of research science for our People & Organizational Performance Practice and a co-leader at the McKinsey Health Institute . What exactly is authentic confidence? “It means you can face challenges because you know you have the skills to handle them. You are clear-eyed about your weaknesses and accept them; you know your purpose in life which guides your personal growth,” explains Jacqueline. “You are also comfortable with the uncertainty of meeting new situations.” When you lack authentic confidence, you let self-doubt and anxiety distract you from pursuing what matters to you. And for some people, a lack of authentic confidence can show up as over-confidence, arrogance and over-estimating true capabilities. Nick van Dam adds: “In order to remain employable, every person needs to upskill or reskill themselves . People only learn when they do things that they have never done before and move outside of their ‘comfort zone’ into their ‘learning zone.’ This is where the magic happens from a development perspective, and the confidence comes in.” From a company’s perspective, employees who are not developing themselves can hinder an organization from advancing the people capabilities they need to execute their business strategy. The book is based on acceptance and commitment training, a cognitive behavior therapy founded by Steven Hayes and others, translated to the context of work . The authors explain how anxiety and stress manifest in the brain and body and influence behavior and experience. It includes insights from neuroscience and organizational behavior; a playbook with 32 on-the-spot tools; and personal stories to bring the concepts to life. For example, in the face of stressful situations, the book helps readers learn how to utilize special breathing, voice, and defusion techniques. One chapter in particular is devoted to the cultivation of specific skills in support of ongoing self-development, including tactics for leading and navigating difficult conversations. The anxiety and stress experience which Jacqui describes in her book can lead to reduced work performance and even to burnout. A recent study by the McKinsey Health Institute, Addressing employee burnout: are you solving the right problem? , found that one in four employees report experiencing burnout symptoms. McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating entity founded on the conviction that, over the next decade, humanity could add as much as 45 billion extra years of higher-quality life. Through its signature Employee Mental Health and Wellbeing initiative, MHI is convening and engaging with leading employers to collect global data, synthesize insights, and encourage innovation. By collaborating, we can learn together and co-create solutions that help workplaces become enablers of health in a way that is good for business, for employees, and for the communities in which they live. Join us at Mckinsey.com/MHI . The report outlines the workplace factors that influence employee mental health, and identifies toxic workplace behavior—interpersonal actions that make people feel excluded, belittled and unsafe, which many organizations don’t recognize—as the single biggest predictor in employee burnout. Another factor has to do with leadership—the stress and toxic behavior of leaders is often cascaded through the hierarchy in organizations. Here’s where Authentic Confidence can help. If leaders and employees learn how to better regulate anxiety and stress, manage their emotions, and develop the courage to make choices that support their values, they can “buffer” or moderate difficult workplaces. However, these are the very same employees—emotionally resilient, confident, effective—who are 60 percent more likely to leave an unhealthy organization. “Clearly any business needs to address both individual employee resilience and the broader workplace factors that cause burnout,” says Jacqueline, “or risk losing some of their most resilient, adaptable employees.” related People are leaving jobs in droves.

McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels agrees. “The combination of McKinsey’s expert insights paired with Salesforce’s best-in-class technology allows us to help companies address their most urgent business challenges and drive sustainable, inclusive growth.” McKinsey and Salesforce have a strong history of collaboration and creating impact together, with this alliance building on McKinsey’s May acquisition of Salesforce Platinum Partner S4G Consulting. The combination of McKinsey’s proprietary knowledge, analytics, benchmarks, client-capability building, and direct impact creation through hands-on delivery with S4G with Salesforce’s CRM platform has helped numerous organizations accelerate their digital transformations for the future of work. “Our alliance with McKinsey has enabled us to bring the power of Salesforce to life in transformative ways that are tailored to specific customers and industries,” said Tyler Prince , EVP, Alliances and Channels at Salesforce. “We look forward to continuing this collaboration and helping drive success for our joint customers.” In one case, McKinsey and Salesforce teamed up to help a European gas-distribution leader create a new digital solution for CapEx management. The solution allows the organization to have end-to-end management of its capital expenditures, which increases productivity across the organization. In fact, the client expects a significant overall reduction in CapEx deployment time of 10 percent. The combination of McKinsey’s expert insights paired with Salesforce’s best-in-class technology allows us to help companies address their most urgent business challenges and drive sustainable, inclusive growth. Elsewhere through the alliance, an AI solution was developed for a global banking leader that helped the organization optimize their client selection processes and make more informed decisions around new opportunities. The solution also provided a real-time view into their deal pipeline, improved account planning, and automated pricing. The effort not only led to better performance in deal execution—through a productivity uplift of 1.5-2X per relationship manager—but also a better customer experience for clients. “By bringing the best of McKinsey and Salesforce together, we can help clients seamlessly navigate their end-to-end customer-centered digital transformation journeys and capture more value from Salesforce’s CRM and other cloud platforms,” said McKinsey senior partner and global head of Alliances and Acquisitions Peter Dahlstrom . related McKinsey acquires S4G Consulting to help businesses ignite growth Never miss a story"
McKinsey opens Global Decarbonization Hub in Houston to accelerate clean energy efforts,"Partnering with the Houston Chamber of Commerce, our firm is contributing to a major energy transition in the region",2022-09-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20opens%20global%20decarbonization%20hub%20in%20houston%20to%20accelerate%20clean%20energy%20efforts/houston-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-opens-global-decarbonization-hub-in-houston-to-accelerate-clean-energy-efforts,"McKinsey opens Global Decarbonization Hub in Houston to accelerate clean energy efforts September 20, 2022 Today, McKinsey’s Houston office is pleased to launch the Global Decarbonization Hub , a joint effort between McKinsey Sustainability and the Global Energy and Materials Practice, to unlock transformational opportunities for the community and our clients. Houston is one of the largest industrial bases in the world. Situated in the Gulf Coast, which is responsible for approximately 10 percent of emissions in the United States and three percent of global emissions, the city is home to 40 percent of all publicly traded oil and gas companies. Given its scale, energy infrastructure, and community of stakeholders, Houston is primed to lead the energy transition across green technologies including hydrogen; carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); circular plastics; and power management. McKinsey’s Houston office has been working to help accelerate that transition in collaboration with the Greater Houston Partnership’s Houston Energy Transition Initiative and Center for Houston’s Future Hydrogen work. Over the last two years, McKinsey has supported these initiatives through a variety of efforts, including a pro-bono study on ways to catalyze the energy transition and a roadmap whitepaper on what it will take to get there. “Texas is the nation’s largest renewable energy producer, home to half of the nation’s hydrogen pipelines, and its companies have unparalleled capabilities in building and operating complex projects,” says McKinsey senior partner Filipe Barbosa . “This is Houston’s moment in time on the global stage.” Over the next decade, McKinsey will invest $100 million into driving asset decarbonization programs across Texas and the Gulf Coast;  scaling climate technologies like CCUS; and building new relevant businesses across energy and materials value chains. In the last six months alone, McKinsey’s Houston office has successfully delivered more than 30 client sustainability engagements spanning CCUS; hydrogen; energy transition strategy; and green business building. For example, in our work with a major oil and gas company, we used McKinsey Power Solutions modeling capabilities to develop a roadmap to abate up to 50 mega-tons of carbon over a ten-year period. We simultaneously developed a plan for green power sourcing that meets massive electrification and infrastructure needs, involving multiple power-sourcing levers and partnerships. Texas is the nation’s largest renewable energy producer, home to half of the nation’s hydrogen pipelines, and its companies have unparalleled capabilities in building and operating complex projects. This is Houston’s moment in time on the global stage. In another engagement, we conducted a strategic review for a major global petrochemical player that found the client could exceed its 2030 targets and accelerate its path towards net zero. To illustrate this, we created a roadmap for how to reduce carbon emissions by 67 percent, an analysis the client is using to increase climate ambitions and build a site-level assessment across its portfolio for capital deployment. The impact on energy markets in the region will be significant with the goal of abating 100 million tons of annual emissions by 2050, and the opportunity to create half a million new jobs.  Given Houston’s global influence in the industry, there is also potential for significant impact and learnings for the energy transition globally. “Decarbonization will lead to a new chapter of economic development, while also addressing a critical problem of climate change,” says McKinsey partner Nikhil Ati . “I am excited to lead this effort in driving impact for our clients, our people, and our community.” related McKinsey launches new Sustainable Materials Hub to accelerate the net-zero transition across value chains McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story"

How a manufacturing moonshot was made,"During COVID-19, the global respiratory medical-device pioneer Vyaire faced an extraordinary demand situation. With partnership from Spirit AeroSystems and McKinsey, they reached unprecedented new production heights.",2022-04-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/operations/how%20we%20help%20clients/a%20manufacturing%20moonshot/vyaire_thumb_workers_591168885_1536x1536.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-a-manufacturing-moonshot-was-made,"How a manufacturing moonshot was made In March 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, the New York Times ran a story under the headline: “There aren’t enough ventilators to cope with the coronavirus.” It explained that the number of ventilators in the world at the time could not meet the rising demand of patients seriously afflicted with the disease. There appeared to be no solution. The complexity of the devices, whose supply chains comprise hundreds of specialized manufacturers scattered across the globe, made production surges seemingly impossible. “Italy wanted to order 4,000,” a European manufacturer told the paper, “but there’s not a chance.” Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, an effort was underway that would unite a group of optimists and problem solvers from Vyaire Medical, Spirit AeroSystems, McKinsey, and an array of Vyaire’s suppliers. Together, they embarked on an ambitious quest to dramatically increase ventilator production, thereby giving medical professionals a chance to better care for critically ill patients. Before it was all said and done, the venture would put thousands of furloughed people back to work, stand up a new ventilator-manufacturing facility, and bolster links in far-flung supply chains on the way to hitting a production rate that would deliver nearly a years’ worth of ventilators every three days . “At Vyaire, we take pride in accepting and facing challenges that others might shy away from,” says Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal. “In this case, we achieved something others might not dare to imagine.” Beyond business as usual The history of mechanical ventilation goes back hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until the polio epidemics of the early 20th century that the devices were widely used. Among the most well-known was the Drinker respirator, or “iron lung,” which looked like a mini submarine and was powered by vacuum-cleaner motors. They’ve come a long way since then. Today, these devices are the size of a large briefcase and utilize multiple circuit boards, complex software, and hundreds of components to control things like air pressure, flow rate, oxygen level, humidity, and temperature. Their engineering has more in common with aerospace systems than with household appliances. Ventilators are much scarcer than either of those things, however, and the outbreak of COVID-19 introduced a vast and widening gulf between supply and demand. In April of 2020, for instance, a McKinsey team looking at global medical supplies estimated that there were about 23 ventilators per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the most plentiful supply. “In Africa,” says Miyu Toyoshima Galliart, a McKinsey associate partner, “the region with the lowest supply according to the analysis, the estimate was fewer than one [ventilator] per 100,000 people.” Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth “To call this extraordinary-demand scenario ‘unprecedented’ would be a gross understatement,” says McKinsey partner Ron Ritter, who helped lead the effort. “Nothing about ventilators—their supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, service, or support—was ever designed for anything like what happened with COVID-19.” Typical ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day. Vyaire’s production team suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Of course, Vyaire’s operations were built for typical demand—not the increased needs of a pandemic. Its usual ventilator production lines make five to seven units a day, which is a lot considering the complexity, quality-control requirements, and capital-asset value. (By comparison, the highest-demand commercial aircraft in modern history never once exceeded a production rate of 60 per month. While different in many ways, both are highly engineered capital assets.) In April of 2020, Vyaire’s main ventilator product line suddenly faced a demand projection of 35,000 units needed immediately. Making that number would require a ramp in production toward 700 units a day in a matter of weeks. “Our executive team heard the concern in the voices of colleagues in the field, who were speaking with clinicians and providers across the world,” says Tammy Noll, senior vice president and general manager of Vyaire’s ventilation franchise. “We knew immediately no amount of business-as-usual was going to work.” So, the company got to work on business-as- unusual . The first step was to maximize output at Vyaire’s Palm Springs, California plant. Joined by industrial engineers from a major auto manufacturer in North America, Vyaire and McKinsey teams worked to revalidate basic manufacturing numbers, dial-in labor, and machinery capacity. Stopwatches and toolboxes in hand, these experts did everything they could—timed process cycles, analyzed bottlenecks, reviewed floor layouts, tweaked machines, and more—to get the most out of the capacity they had at hand. “We started with a spreadsheet,” says Bhavuk Tandon, a McKinsey associate and member of the team walking the factory floor, “and we were conducting time studies on the floor, going through every cell, understanding all the lines and how they worked. We needed that information to help us understand what we had to do to build a facility that [would] give 30 times and more—fast.” Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations. The practice, Ron says, can be an effective first step during critical shortages. “Without constant industrial discipline and performance pressure, a ‘hidden factory’ of latent capacity normally waits in everyday operations,” he explains. “Finding it normally produces a 20 to 30 percent boost in output right away.” Once the analysis was complete, Vyaire added shifts to the reoptimized line. The moves helped increase production by about threefold. It was a huge leap by industry standards, but well short of what it would take to begin meeting demand. To get there, the company would need to make an even bigger move—to the American heartland. An interview with Vyaire Medical CEO Gaurav Agarwal A new workforce, a new building With its Palm Springs plant running as hard as it could—yet still falling behind demand—Vyaire leaders began working hard to find more workers. “This was about finding an entire second workforce,” says David Marchand, now a McKinsey alum, who helped lead the project. “In a single product line, we needed an estimated 800 people: front-line operators, supervisors, process engineers, maintenance techs, security guards, department leads, site executives, warehouse staff, shipping departments, buyers—and they needed to know how to perform extremely well together, right away.” When needed immediately, a workforce like that can’t be hired incrementally. The only way to acquire one was to locate an intact team—which came from Spirit AeroSystems. The aerospace and medical-device industries may seem like strange bedfellows, but Spirit was the right partner for several reasons. Operationally, their people know industrialization, have high production standards, and operate complex supply chains. And in this case, given COVID-19’s impact on air travel, the company had people who were furloughed and more than ready to get back to work. We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world. This was clearly an international-security-level situation. But beyond that, it was Spirit’s culture that made them the perfect fit. According to Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile, “Spirit cultivates a ‘can be done,’ mission-oriented culture that has been built on accepting challenges.” This challenge tapped the company’s core values of transparency, collaboration, and inspiration, and it inspired the combined workforce of over 1000 employees. “We embraced the opportunity to do something so relevant for the community and the world,” says Tom. “This was clearly an international-security-level situation.” To get the most out of this workforce, Vyaire looked beyond California in search of more production capacity. They found it 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, where Vyaire decided to open an additional ventilator plant. That may be easy to imagine, but it was hard to execute. Beyond a suitable 55,000 square-foot building, it took machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, quality control, assembly, testing facilities, and much more. Capacities for each manufacturing-process step had to be calculated. Several miles of copper, medical-grade oxygen gas-flow lines, electrical drops, and industrial-grade air compressors had to be installed. Data connectivity to handle huge test-protocol transactions with cloud-based legacy software needed to be set. Workstations, production tooling, and a range of fixtures had to be built or sourced and calibrated. Even basics like car parking for 200-person shifts, break rooms, badging, security, and fire-control had to be installed. Most critically, Vyaire and Spirit had to design and build workforce COVID-19 safety, including social-distancing fixtures, temperature screening, reporting, and testing protocols. “We were hyper focused on providing a safe environment for every single person who was about to work in that building,” says Noll. “We also knew the risk of outbreak in this facility carried added weight. Not only were we concerned about their health and that of their families, but we were also cognizant that the consequences of illness there would be felt by patients in need of these devices across the globe.” Vyaire and Spirit were now ready to chase a benchmark that, months prior, would’ve only existed in a company’s wildest dreams. All they needed now were enough parts to make it a reality. Supply-chain reaction Supply-chain operations make and deliver tangible aspects of our lives and create the fundamental material pathways in a functioning society. Unappreciated in normal times, they rush to the forefront in times of crisis, such as the great wars and most recently, COVID-19. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. During COVID-19, these suppliers were just as pressed as Vyaire. Ventilators depend on outsourced materials. Much of their supply-chain expense sits among fasteners, precision-machined valves, resin-molded components, electronic circuits, batteries, and more. During COVID-19, the plants that manufacture these components were just as pressed as Vyaire. Versions of the same efficiency processes happening in Palm Springs and Wichita unfolded in hundreds of operations across the ventilator supply chain. The effectiveness of these moves was critical to boosting output, but they were harder for Vyaire to control. The suppliers medical-device manufacturers use were scattered globally. During the COVID-19 outbreak, they were often hit by competing demands. For example, an electronics manufacturer that makes medical-device circuit boards could see a wave of demand for virtual-work devices. Suppliers did their best to respond. Many found ways to ramp-up quickly and help get Vyaire and Spirit what they needed. Others lost adjacent demand and had capacity to spare. But in some cases, suppliers lost capacity or had exceedingly long lead times. The most critical of these situations—the ones whose projected output would limit the team’s target rate—were placed on a “red list.” Early on, the red list was long. “It was apparent that dozens of material sources might hold us back,” says Jenna Stauffer, a McKinsey engagement manager who worked on supply chains in the effort. Clearing the red list would require advanced intervention. A group comprising Vyaire’s most experienced buyers and manufacturing experts worked directly with suppliers to get specific information on process flows, bottleneck constraints, shipping delays, and the company’s own component constraints. In most cases, these interventions worked. But in extreme cases, teams cleared to travel during COVID-19 lockdown conditions worked directly with vendors on site. In one example, a European producer of pressure transducers emerged as a key constraint. Teams traveled to the plant, mapped the entire process flow, and installed IoT sensors on a key rate-determining step in a single day. The work provided live, digital tracking of actual production against the max potential rate, and it helped the site raise its output within 48 hours. The red list work was among the most relentless of the entire effort. It went on around the clock daily, as time zones rolled through the global night, demanding nonstop problem solving for months. The impossible made possible—by people If machines and technology were this effort’s arms and legs, people—many of whom have never met in person to this day—were its head and heart. They were united through a relentless drive to help, a product of the cultures at both Vyaire and Spirit, and they had the skills necessary to do so. “Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring,” says Catherine-Sophie Haigh, a McKinsey operations specialist who worked on the project. “Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity, and they trusted the teammate by their side—in many cases by their ‘virtual’ side.” Vyaire and Spirit were so driven and daring. Together, everyone realized this was a once-in-a-career opportunity. This was especially evident around one of the initiative’s most critical moments. When it became clear that the Palm Springs plant would never have the capacity to hit rising target rates, and splitting focus between it and the Wichita plant was sapping energy, leaders decided to execute what became known as “lift and shift” to consolidate the entire operation under a single roof. This meant shutting down the key ventilator production lines in the California plant over a weekend, crating all production equipment, and moving it as quickly and safely as possible to Kansas. Given the stakes, the risk of losing equipment in transit, having it not restart, or suffering irreparable damage was frightening. “I’d done something like this on a smaller scale before,” says McKinsey partner Jonathan Tilley, who helped lead the effort. “It’s not plug and play. I was nervous, and we all knew what a loss in output meant for people who needed ventilators.” During removal, teams would video-record and catalogue every screw, bolt, and connector to help the receiving teams put it all back together. The transit process was scrutinized for weather conditions and other variables. The team even consulted a satellite manufacturer to learn about preventing vibration damage en route to the new facility. “This entire move was conceived, decided, and completed in less than ten days,” Jonathan adds. “By working together, we all pulled it off.” The “lift and shift” success turned out to be one proof point in a massive success story. As the project progressed into the fall of 2020, Vyaire’s global delivery of ventilators crossed 35,000, with peak rates of more than 600 per day sustained on one product line, with more than 1,000 across all. “I still remember when the call came across to join this effort,” says McKinsey senior expert and associate partner Phil Duncan, who helped lead the work. “It was one of those moments in your career when you know you’ve just got to do it. It was a little nerve-wracking at points. It was emotional and meaningful. We all have a ton of pride in this because we did the work together.” Ten lessons on supply-chain readiness. By Ron Ritter Vyaire and Spirit got so much right in this unprecedented effort. Here’s what we learned from them. There is tremendous gain in getting this ever more right, as Vyaire and Spirit have shown us. Routine cost and delivery performance can improve through everyday enhancements across the organization. Stronger, more confident, and better-prepared organizational talent will build lasting culture around a sense of purpose. More rigorous design standards and better supplier networks are better able to respond with resiliency, and the brand will be stronger and more credible in projecting to the market. In normal days, operations will deliver better, faster, cheaper, safer. In a crisis, it may make all the difference in a decisive response. At peak, Vyaire was producing more ventilators in three days than their entire 2019 output. Over 19,000 units were built in the Kansas factory in just over 12 weeks by Spirit’s workforce. Similar feats were accomplished at other plants around the world, including among thousands of component suppliers. “We all worked together to create a state-of-the-art ventilator-production operation, supply chain, logistics, and workforce in less than six weeks that sent critical devices to patients in need around the world,” says Spirit’s CEO Tom Gentile. “I could not be prouder of what we all have done.” Vyaire CEO Gaurav Agarwal agrees. “Yes, it was bold, and daunting at times, but there was never a chance we weren’t going to stand up to this moment,” he says. “Patients and customers were counting on us and our collective teams to meet the challenge.” This particular moment may have passed, and critical-care ventilator demand has since eased, but according to McKinsey’s Ron Ritter, the campaign nevertheless stands as an epic industrial success: “It also says a lot about what organizations can do when they have the courage to face what feels like an impossible objective, and inspire their people to do the same.” Related Practice To learn more about how McKinsey helps organizations improve manufacturing, please visit our Operations website , where you can also gain insight into CEO leadership of operations, supply-chain resilience , and much more."
Black-owned brands eye &lsquo;unicorn&rsquo; success with McKinsey&rsquo;s Next 1B,"McKinsey is equipping Black founders of consumer and retail brands with tools, resources, and community to put them on the path to billion-dollar valuations.",2022-09-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/black%20owned%20brands%20eye%20unicorn%20success%20with%20mckinseys%20next%201b/next1b-hero-1536x864.jpg,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/black-owned-brands-eye-unicorn-success-with-mckinseys-next-1b,"Black-owned brands eye ‘unicorn’ success with McKinsey’s Next 1B Myles Powell and Danielle Tubbs September 22, 2022 In the business world, unicorns are real. But these startups with valuations of a billion dollars or more are rare, and Black-founded unicorns are exceedingly so. In the last 10 years, for example, less than 2 percent of the 400 US unicorn startups had Black founders—with less than five Black brands reaching this milestone in consumer and retail . At the same time, McKinsey research shows that consumers want to be inclusive in their purchasing. Forty five percent—likely representing well over a hundred million shoppers— believe retailers should actively support Black-owned businesses and brands . “We looked at this data and said, ‘What role can McKinsey play in jump-starting growth for Black-owned businesses?’” says Tabitha Strobel, engagement manager at McKinsey. The answer is Next 1B , a business acceleration program for founders of Black-owned consumer and retail brands in the US that provides essential tools and resources for growth. Next 1B launched in 2022 with two offerings for founders at different stages of growth. Next 1B: Founders is a 10-week cohort-based program designed to deliver practical tools, McKinsey expertise and insights, and leadership coaching to help founders and brands grow. The program targets brands with below $15 million in annual revenue and is building a large, supportive community of Black entrepreneurs in consumer and retail. Next 1B: Scalers provides dedicated McKinsey support for a small subset of Black-owned brands typically with over $15 million in annual revenue who receive a growth diagnostic, execution blueprint, and follow-on targeted support to unlock the next phase of growth. Scalers launched in the summer of 2022 and is currently expanding through end of year and beyond. Next 1B grew out of the firm’s 10 actions toward racial equity, including investing $200 million in pro bono efforts aimed at economic empowerment . “We spoke to over 30 Black founders while designing Next 1B and we heard common themes around lack of access—to capital, to networks and insider knowledge, and channels,” says Tabitha, who worked to build the program along with colleagues Tyler Harris, Liz Pharis, Pamela Brown, Sara Prince , and Tiffany Burns . “So, we designed Founders to address these challenges, to share knowledge, build networks, introduce capital partners, and share retailer support and expectations as brands scale.” Tyler, an associate partner at McKinsey, says that Black founders face particular challenges in brand perception among a range of stakeholders, including partners and investors. “Some founders are restricted in that their brands were perceived as being only for Black consumers despite having a wider reach,” she says. “Others were less sure how much of their identity they wanted at the forefront of their brand.” The founder identity, she says, is the foundation of Next 1B: Founders, and the program gives space for discussions around identity, aspirations, and roadblocks to build community. Myles Powell is the founder of 8 Myles , a brand of gourmet comfort foods. Myles wanted to provide a home-cooked-meal experience to consumers, inspired by the comfort foods he ate growing up. As a member of the Founders program, Myles has found the opportunity to network particularly impactful. “It can be very, very lonely as an entrepreneur. When you can be with people who understand where you are operationally and mentally—it’s the community and camaraderie that makes this special,” Myles says. Next 1B: Founders brings in industry experts in retail, social media, and venture capital to share lessons learned and open their networks to participants. And the community camaraderie building is designed to be a support system that can lift business owners up in ways that expertise and networks can’t. For instance, during a breakout session, a participant practiced a pitch for a major retailer and got feedback and support from fellow founders, later winning the business deal. Danielle Tubbs, a member of the Founders program who sells vegan cookies through her brand Tubby’s Taste , reflected on the power of community, saying she’s never stepped into a business room with people that looked like her. “Being able to share challenges and wins as Black entrepreneurs has been one of the most powerful experiences in my eight years as an entrepreneur,” she says. “It’s been our aspiration to build the biggest community of Black business founders in consumer and retail, and seeing it take shape has been one of the gems of this program,” Tabitha says. As much as McKinsey aims to build skills, resources, community and networks, Tabitha stressed that many of the business owners in the program have dedicated years to building impressive brands and amassed considerable expertise with the resources available to them. She says the program took shape as a partnership rather than a traditional learning atmosphere, with all parties sharing knowledge and experience. “I'm so inspired by the people in the room,” she says. “They've already accomplished so much.

A new nationwide campaign is encouraging employers to change hiring practices.",2022-09-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/tearing%20the%20paper%20ceiling%20mckinsey%20supports%20movement%20for%20upward%20mobility%20of%20millions%20of%20workers/paperceiling-hero-small-1301427171-1536x864.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/tearing-the-paper-ceiling-mckinsey-supports-movement-for-upward-mobility-of-millions-of-workers,"Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers September 23, 2022 There’s a hidden talent pool that most employers overlook—the more than 70 million workers in the US who are STARs, or workers ‘skilled through alternative routes.’ Whether through community college, workforce training, bootcamp or certificate programs, military service, or on-the-job learning, STARs have the skills for higher-wage jobs but often find themselves blocked from consideration. This week, nonprofit Opportunity@Work and the Ad Council have launched a nationwide campaign to ‘ Tear the Paper Ceiling ’ and encourage employers to change hiring practices. McKinsey is providing pro bono support to the effort through data and analytics tools that enable recruiters to recognize STARs and their skills. “While companies scramble to find talent amid a perceived skills gap, many of their job postings have needlessly excluded half of the workers in the country who have the skills for higher-wage work,” says Byron Auguste , founder of Opportunity@Work and a former senior partner at McKinsey. “Companies like the ones we're proud to call partners in this effort—and those we hope will join—can lead the way by tapping into skilled talent from a far wider range of backgrounds.” McKinsey has driven extensive research on skills-based hiring and human capital , and built data-driven solutions that help employers implement new ways of screening for knowledge, skills, and capacity to learn. “A few years ago, we looked at many talent solutions in the market. There was a real risk of hard-wiring outdated notions of being a skilled worker,” says McKinsey partner Carolyn Pierce , who leads the technology team in the People and Organizational Performance practice . “Those systems gave little credit even to our own team members for skills learned on the job.” People & Organizational Performance: Equipping people and organizations to unleash sustained performance Carolyn and her team began collaborating with Opportunity@Work to prove the value and transferability of skills developed through work experience. “The Opportunity@Work team has done some incredible research that makes the business case for hiring STARs into today’s most in-demand jobs” says Carolyn. Our pro bono support will help make those insights more widely available to employers. “We increasingly hear from employers that they want to recruit from the STARs talent pool,” says Shad Ahmed, COO of Opportunity@Work. “But they need practical, data-driven tools to replace degree screens and hire STARs. The portal we are building with support from McKinsey will help employers identify which jobs should be open to STARs and help them source from this valuable talent pool. It’s a key part of our mission to create vital technology infrastructure wired for inclusion.” McKinsey is committed to tearing the ‘paper ceiling’ in our own hiring practices. “We have made significant investments to ensure that our own talent culture is both distinctive and inclusive, attracting and developing talent from a wide range of backgrounds,” says Katy George , senior partner and CHRO of McKinsey. “We are investing in more ways to recruit, hire, and grow STARs through a holistic approach that recognizes candidates’ skills and experience, problem-solving ability and intrinsic capabilities.” McKinsey’s technology organization is at the forefront of this effort, with many entry-level roles already open to STARs who have the necessary knowledge and skills. “We already have technologists at the firm—from entry-level through partner—who are STARs,” says Katy. “Our technology teams work on important and challenging problems, from helping organizations reduce their carbon footprint to improving worker safety. Our best path to solving these problems is to attract talented people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Our recruiting teams are actively working to make more STARs aware of these opportunities and encourage them to apply.” Creating more opportunities for STARs requires more than simply removing degree requirements from job descriptions. “We are scaling support for apprenticeships, bootcamps, and training programs to accelerate pathways for STARs into our firm” adds Katy. “The programs will help STAR talent build any additional skills needed for success at McKinsey and beyond.” There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential. We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up. Byron is hopeful that having McKinsey as a sponsor of this campaign will encourage more employers to change their talent practices. “A lot of organizations know that McKinsey is very data driven. It’s a strong signal that they are helping to build better ways to screen for talent and creating opportunities for STARs through their own hiring,” he says. Challenging the misconceptions associated with not having a college degree is key to helping more people tear through the paper ceiling. “Screening for a degree is one way to find people with skills and the capacity to learn—the problem is that you’re also screening for who had the right social and economic conditions in place to attend college,” says Carolyn. “There are lots of reasons why someone might not begin or complete a degree that have nothing to do with their intrinsic abilities or potential,” Carolyn adds. “We know there are better ways to screen for talent and now we have the research and tools to back that up.” related No such thing as a dead-end job, new McKinsey research finds Reskilling older workers for new careers in tech Never miss a story"

Building on a proven history of client impact, our organizations have now blended select Cloud by McKinsey offerings with AWS Professional Services , giving clients new ways to identify the right cloud transformation opportunities from day one—and deliver them at greater speed and scale than ever before. “From day one, the essence of our collaboration with AWS has always been to help clients tackle their toughest business and technical problems through cloud transformations,” says Peter Dahlstrom , McKinsey senior partner and global head of Alliances and Acquisitions. “But over the last three years, it has proven to be so much more than that. Today, we’ve become true impact partners to our clients as we drive full end-to-end, cloud-enabled business transformations that build capabilities clients need to fuel resilience and drive growth.” McKinsey and AWS first started working together to help organizations accelerate transformations through digital-native, disruptive capabilities enabled by cloud technology. Together, we help clients ‘innovate’—through advanced analytics, IoT, automation at scale, and more—and ‘rejuvenate’ by using cloud to lower traditional legacy IT costs and risks. By combining McKinsey’s expertise and impact approach with AWS’ growing cloud innovations and ‘learn by doing’ model, our relationship has already delivered impact in nearly 100 client engagements to date. The collaboration is part of McKinsey’s open ecosystem of alliances and acquisitions and leverages the AWS Partner Network of more 100,000 members. Working together, McKinsey and AWS have helped a pharmaceutical company transform the patient experience by enabling remote triage through a virtual agent that is expected to handle more than one million calls annually. We also helped an automotive manufacturer consolidate real-time data from 30,000 locations in the supply chain, driving a 30 percent efficiency improvement by 2025 and $1 billion in anticipated supply-chain savings. And using Amazon SageMaker, we helped Emirates Team New Zealand successfully defend their America’s Cup title by creating a new sailor for their team: an AI training bot . By introducing a new suite of joint offerings with AWS Professional Services, we have a new way to help our clients solve their toughest technical problems and build capabilities over time. Our new offerings include SpeedLab for Customer Experience and SpeedLab for Supply Chain. Additionally, Jumpstart Cloud helps organizations set up the right technical foundations and tools for rapid cloud adoption, and Jumpstart Mainframe helps organizations unlock business value when migrating from their legacy systems. Creating value beyond the hype “Our work at AWS is guided by our leadership principles, with customers at the core of everything we do. Combined with McKinsey's values and industry expertise this partnership presents an opportunity to raise the bar by bringing the best of AWS’ offerings and capabilities to customers. We are excited about the possibilities ahead in unlocking business value for our customers” said Al Opher , vice president, Worldwide Head of AWS Professional Services. While the purpose of our collaboration remains the same—to help business leaders build the technology and capabilities they need to drive enduring change—we now bring in the deepest and broadest range experts in McKinsey and AWS to enable end-to-end execution from day one at greater scale. “We are highly committed to our partnership with McKinsey and look forward to expanding across multiple industries to solve complex problems and drive significant business impact,” said Ruba Borno , vice president, Worldwide Channels & Alliances at AWS. “McKinsey’s expertise in key technologies and industry knowledge, coupled with AWS’ role as the leading cloud provider, is what customers are looking for to innovate and achieve their business ambitions.” As the capabilities from McKinsey and AWS continue to grow—at pace and alongside the evolving needs of customers—we know we are only in the beginning stages of what will be a long, impactful, and enduring alliance. related Flying across the sea, propelled by AI McKinsey acquires Candid Partners, a leader in cloud consulting Never miss a story"
&lsquo;A sense of journey&rsquo;: McKinsey&rsquo;s new Mumbai office designed for age of hybrid work,"With remote and hybrid work increasingly common, McKinsey&rsquo;s new Mumbai office makes the office a home away from working from home.",2022-09-28T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20sense%20of%20journey%20mckinseys%20new%20mumbai%20office%20designed%20for%20the%20age%20of%20hybrid%20work/mumbai-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-sense-of-journey-mckinseys-new-mumbai-office-designed-for-age-of-hybrid-work,"‘A sense of journey’: McKinsey’s new Mumbai office designed for age of hybrid work September 28, 2022 McKinsey’s presence in India has grown and changed with the country. We opened our first office there in 1992, in what was then Bombay, as the country’s economy opened up. The expansion of our work, in hand with growth in India’s economy, led to office openings in Delhi, Chennai, and Bangalore, India’s tech capital. But the latest change in our physical presence in India is one of innovation in addition to expansion, with a new Mumbai office opening in early July. When it came time to expand our footprint in Mumbai’s burgeoning financial and business district, Bandra Kurla Complex, our Mumbai office managing partner Kanika Kalra knew it had to be a space that reflected the drastic changes in work brought about by COVID-19. McKinsey Global Institute’s The future of work after COVID-19 report found that the bar for the appeal of an office had gone up dramatically since the pandemic. “We started designing this office during the pandemic, and we were sure work would not be what it was before,” Kanika says. “The office would have to be a special place that fosters a sense of belonging to a larger organization.” The space is spread over six floors of an office tower, each with its own theme, brought to life through artwork—all made by Indian artists, such as a map of Mumbai made of computer keys, and natural design elements such as a fishpond. The materials were largely sourced within India, including Athangudi (native to the Chettinad area of Tamil Nadu) tiles in the second-floor bistro and Indian motifs on the carpets. “We wanted to encourage people to move around, to explore,” says Kanika, “to incorporate a sense of journey into an office day.” Ishita Kayastha , associate partner in Mumbai, was slow to return to the office as the pandemic eased, but the opening of this new office changed her outlook. “It’s just so bright and vibrant, with lots of sunlight,” she says. “The various themes, seating, colors; we get to explore different moods and sides of ourselves depending on what we want.” The underlying goal of creating an in-office journey worthy of journeying to is to build and strengthen connectivity among employees. “Work happens no matter where you are,” says Kanika, “but collaboration and the elevation of work doesn't. So, this is all about making that magic of collaboration.” As employees make their way through workspaces and floors, from the couch to the café to the roof, they might strike gold and catch a chance to pick someone’s brain who they’d normally not have reason to set up a meeting with. Ishita says she’s received impromptu help from firm experts a few times this way. “It’s different than just running into someone in a hall or an elevator. The space encourages you to talk,” Ishita says. “I can feel the increase in energy and feeling of connectedness between teams.” It really came together with this new office, which became a natural center of gravity to gather people together around shared senses of purpose and meaning. Staff have also been proactive about building connectivity. Shivanand Sinha , a partner in Mumbai, helped set up the Mumbai chapter of Fab Clubs, a dozen activity groups for employees with common interests, such as hiking, films, biking, board games and music, and attributes their success to the office. “We had the idea to do something like this to encourage people to come back after COVID, but it was slow to start,” says Shiv. “It really came together with this new office, which became a natural center of gravity to gather people together around shared senses of purpose and meaning.” McKinsey is currently not requiring employees to come into the office daily, giving people the freedom to create work conditions that work best for them. The challenge for many companies using remote and hybrid models is to blend this freedom with the cohesion attained by physical gatherings. Kanika believes rethinking the office is key and likens this new era to how workplace attire has evolved. “There used to be formal wear and casual wear and then this wonderful mix of the two that evolved from the tech revolution,” she says. “I think now there’s the office, there’s home, and there’s a little mix of the two that is happening, something warmer and more comfortable to be at.” related The rebirth of workspace design: An interview with Gensler co-CEO Diane Hoskins Never miss a story"

Our largest media day ever, the event drew dozens of journalists, including bureau chiefs, columnists, and editors from 15 countries, who spent the day moderating panels and participating in discussions and interviews. McKinsey partners and experts representing 12 countries shared insights with the standing-room-only audience on topics that reflected the wide range of our research, from inflation to decarbonization, innovation, security, and economic inclusion. It was also an opportunity to preview our latest perspective on Europe, “ Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap ,” published with McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). McKinsey also used the event to launch its new, pan-European publishing series, Lifting Europe's Ambition . As part of his opening remarks, Europe managing partner Magnus Tyreman introduced the flagship series, explaining to journalists that the series will be a multi-year, multi-media project covering the most important issues on European business leaders’ and policymakers’ minds. It features a dedicated microsite where visitors can find all of McKinsey’s European insights in one place, along with a video interview series featuring McKinsey leaders and external experts. Magnus continued with his opening remarks by noting the meeting had been planned and cancelled twice due to the pandemic; for this third time, the moment was auspicious. “Never has there been so much uncertainty. We are experiencing a convergence of issues—war, inflation, an energy crisis, and geopolitical tensions are at their highest level,” explained Magnus Tyreman , the managing partner of McKinsey Europe in his opening remarks. “We will not return to normal. This is the end of an era.” The second panel examined how the war in the Ukraine was upending the development of net zero pathways; another discussion posited the industries in which Europe could lead; in the closing session, the managing partners from France, Germany and the UK shared findings on what keeps CEOs up at night in their respective economies. Lifting Europe’s Ambition While European leaders have shown great resolve in responding to the war  and resulting shocks, they will need to build the same momentum to face the region's ́slow-motion technology crisis, as outlined in our report. Europe has many high-performing companies, but in aggregate, they are falling seriously behind. Between 2014 and 2019, large European companies with more than a billion in revenue were 20 percent less profitable, grew revenue 40 percent more slowly, and spent 40 percent less on R&D, compared with US firms. “In this study, instead of looking at Europe through the lens of sectors, we look at it through the lens of 10 transversal or interlinking technologies,” explains Solveigh Hieronimus , a senior partner. “Europe leads on only two of these—next generation materials and clean tech. We have strong STEM talent…a strong bio industry…we should be able to gain excellence here. However, there are some technology areas where it is too late to lead, particularly where we have not invested in the past few years.” While this trend is not new, the issue now is that technology is overtaking almost every sector, and reshaping competitive dynamics. Eric Hazan , a senior partner, outlined the reasons for this slow rate of growth: “The region leads in so many areas: cleantech, materials, the bio revolution, advanced industries, and more. Our human capital is second to no one. But there’s the question of scale, particularly when it comes to technology investment. There are few established ecosystems for sharing expertise and data, and our regulatory environment and scarce risk capital don’t encourage disruption and innovation.” “It's not surprising that in such a challenging environment, 'resilience' comes up again and again as business concern,” points out Maria del Mar Martinez , a senior partner. “For businesses, this means having the ability and all of the levers—resources, flexibility, redundancy—to deal with adversity and shocks and continually adapt. Companies have to prepare not only for the coming recession, but also how to recover after it.” At times throughout the day, the discussion turned existential. “Are we being too pessimistic? too focused on fragmentation and regulations? Maybe we should be looking more at our mindsets, correcting our self-image, and raising our levels of ambition?”  These were just some of the questions raised by the audience. Everyone agreed that it will take bold action to solve the challenges facing Europe’s business leaders and policymakers and to lift the continent’s ambitions. related Partnering with the world’s leading tech companies to accelerate innovation Never miss a story"
Latest McKinsey tech outlook identifies 14 key trends for business leaders,"The McKinsey Technology Council has released its second annual Technology Trends Outlook, helping leaders track the tools that matter most to their businesses.",2022-10-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20research%2014%20tech%20trends%20to%20track/techtrends-hero-small-1178244831-1536x864.jpg,"Innovation,AI & Analytics,Sustainability",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/latest-mckinsey-tech-outlook-identifies-14-key-trends-for-business-leaders,"Latest McKinsey tech outlook identifies 14 key trends for business leaders October 4, 2022 The McKinsey Technology Council— a global group of over 100 scientists, entrepreneurs, researchers, and business leaders—has published its second annual Technology Trends Outlook . By assessing metrics of innovation, interest, investment, and adoption, the council has prioritized and synthesized 40 technologies into 14 leading trends. Following on from last year, applied AI once again earned the highest score for innovation in the report. Sustainability, meanwhile, emerged as a major catalyst for tech around the world, with clean energy and sustainable consumption drawing the highest investment from private-equity and venture-capital firms. And five new trends were added to this year’s edition:  industrializing machine learning, Web3, immersive-reality technologies, the future of mobility, and the future of space. In this post, McKinsey senior partner Lareina Yee , expert partner Roger Roberts , and McKinsey Global Institute partner Michael Chui share their thoughts about what the findings may mean for leaders over the next few years. There are a number of tech trend reports published each year. What’s unique about this one? Lareina: It provides a bird’s eye view of the full spectrum of technology trends, from the bio revolution to advanced connectivity to space exploration. It also shows how all of these trends are threading together so leaders can understand the opportunities they create. For example, the metaverse is not a single trend but includes cloud computing, advanced connectivity, applied AI, and also immersive reality technologies and Web3, all of which allow for the creation of truly new experiences and modes of interaction. What this means is that creativity—how these technologies can be used together—may be the ‘constraining’ resource now, more than just computing or storage or network bandwidth. What surprised you most about the findings? Roger: One thing that I think is under appreciated is the potential in next-generation software development , the tools and capabilities which allow software developers to better write, develop, and test code faster and to therefore innovate in much quicker timeframes. That has huge power, so if I looked at which of these trends that people should be pushing faster and harder, that would be one. Also, over the next year or two, I think we’re going to see a lot more clarity emerging about the potential impact of quantum computing , which has been moving from science to engineering and will start to really scale in certain use cases. Michael: I am excited about the huge leap forward that industrializing machine learning (a form of AI) has taken, even over the past year, moving from pilots into production scale for real-world business use. Machine learning has an incredible variety of applications, creating value across multiple sectors. Some examples include predicting when customers are at risk of “churning” and dropping a service, identifying potential financial fraud more accurately, and assuring autonomous vehicles can navigate the streets of our cities safely. What should business leaders take away from this tech report? Roger: If a company can better understand those technologies which have the most momentum—by which we mean research, venture funding, use-case development—they can identify those that they need to act on in the next several years, and those for which they can take on a posture of watchful waiting. In practical terms this means thinking about, “What tech curves am I going to ride here and then what curves am I going to try to bend?” And by “riding,” I mean utilizing outside R&D and talent and letting that lift my business. On the “bending” side, leaders would say, “I’m putting my own engineering muscle behind thinking about how to shape something to our needs or build something unique on top of these platforms.” That’s where the combination of creativity, design, engineering, and data science need to come together at the front lines to build a new consumer experience or to launch that new business. Lareina: Companies also need to think about how these tech initiatives might shape the partnerships or alliances of their ecosystem. We know that companies with stronger networks of relationships will be better positioned to win in the world that’s being reinvented by these technologies. McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2022 How will this research shape the work McKinsey does with its clients? Lareina: We’re sharing the findings and partnering with industries to think through how specific trends can best help companies achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. Some examples of this include:  identifying opportunities for consumer brands to develop beauty products with biodegradable ingredients; exploring the ways that advanced connectivity can extend healthcare and education services for more inclusive access; and looking at how immersive tech can deepen training and product support, so manufacturers can enhance customer and employee experiences together. Any predictions for next year? Michael: From year to year, the names of the trends aren’t going to shift so much. But the level of investment, the way in which they’re being applied, the rate of transition from science to engineering to practice will change. I’d love to see enterprises employing the engineering and also using their talents in creativity, design, and organizational change to combine and apply these technologies in new and unexpected ways. Roger: I would highlight that it’s not just what the tech trends are, but how fast they are moving that is really extraordinary.  We have seen this during the pandemic with the unprecedented pace of development and delivery of mRNA vaccines. This happened at a rate that many experienced people did not think would be possible. It shows that there are a range of players—governmental, environmental, technological—combining to accelerate technology change on many dimensions.  Leaders need to prepare to move at this pace. related Three experts offer an inside look at the state of AI Microsoft’s Wright joins McKinsey as chief technology and platform officer Never miss a story"

For Alberto, who had been living in Spain until recently, the new office represents a homecoming: “I was born and grew up in Uruguay—this is a very promising time, and it feels great to be back.” The country has a vibrant, diversified economy and is a leader in South America in sustainability. It’s also a strong democracy, with stable institutions and advanced social legislation. “ Uruguay is a country with a distinctive culture of consensus, in which changes are broadly agreed,” explains Alberto. “This is attractive to investors who are looking for a long-run, stable environment. ” The new office will also serve clients in Paraguay and Bolivia. Uruguay has a green grid: 98 percent of the power is renewable, a combination of wind, solar, and hydroelectricity. And it has a growing and promising talent pool. “Large companies are moving here and the startup ecosystem is vibrant,” shares Xavier. He  also leads McKinsey Sustainability in Latin America, which helps companies and countries improve their sustainability performance and build green businesses. For example, we have helped develop a comprehensive green hydrogen roadmap for the country. Welcome to McKinsey Uruguay Other types of green business building in Uruguay, in which we have been involved at different stages, include bio energy and biofuels, synthetic fuels for exports, carbon credits, and sustainable agriculture. “Such green businesses represent a significant economic opportunity—possibly up to 50 percent of the GDP—and would clearly accelerate the socio-economic development of the country while advancing sustainability for the planet,” says Xavier. The Montevideo office will also develop teams in analytics and digital expertise to help both startups and established companies use these capabilities to improve performance and to innovate products and services.  “This could range from helping manufacturing companies increase the effectiveness of operations to banks and retailers creating digital ecosystems,” says Alberto. One way our experts will help companies grow is by cultivating an ‘ accelerator approach ’ —to look beyond the local economy to regional and international markets for partnerships to quickly build their businesses. This involves a greater opening of the economy, transitioning towards an export mentality, attracting external investors and cultivating connections to global supply chains. The Montevideo office looks to expand to 60 people or more by 2025 by recruiting and developing local and international talent. “Our team is 65 percent  women—and we’d work on maintaining parity at the least,"" says Xavier. “In terms of nationality, the office already comprises colleagues from France, Argentina, and Uruguay.” And the office culture? “A new location is a new venture and as such, it will necessarily be very entrepreneurial,” says Xavier, “and we will encourage this.” related ¡Bienvenidos a Panamá!

Three days earlier, Reina, 15 at the time, had acted on suicidal thoughts, and Kana spent nearly every hour since searching for mental health crisis resources for adolescents. Everyone told her the same thing: take her to the ER. Kana, who is now the director of brain health at the McKinsey Health Institute, is also a 25-year veteran in the behavioral health arena and knew the ER wouldn’t help her daughter—but there was no other option. The doctor recommended inpatient care, but no beds were available, so for three and a half days, Reina was confined to a glass-walled room under bright lights and constant surveillance, isolated from everyone except her mom, who slept in the hospital chair next to her as they waited for a bed to open up in the adolescent psych unit. “Sitting in an emergency room for days at a time, not being able to get the help your kid needs is devastating,” Kana says. “I had advocated for evidence-based mental health services throughout my career, yet couldn’t find them for my own child.” A growing behavioral health crisis Kana and Reina’s experience isn’t uncommon. In the United States, crises related to behavioral health, a term that refers to both mental and substance use disorders, have been on the rise for more than two decades—particularly among youth. Between 2009 and 2020, the United States saw a 30 percent increase in the national age-adjusted suicide rate. By winter of 2021 , the weekly rate of ER visits by adolescents who attempted suicide was 39 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the average rate for adolescent girls had increased 50 percent over the previous year. Despite these alarming numbers, community crisis-care resources remain limited. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline center, roughly 39 million Americans aged 12 and older could benefit from having access to a service for vulnerable people dealing with suicide, mental health, or substance use issues. Limited crisis services mean law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and ERs end up responding to most behavioral health crises, regardless of whether the individual is a threat to public safety or in need of emergency care. “What we're doing now is services that are high cost and low efficacy,” says Kana. “It’s the wrong recipe.” Dr. John Palmieri is a senior medical advisor and the acting director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Behavioral Health Crisis Team , which includes the 988 Lifeline. He spent the early part of his clinical career working in emergency psychiatric departments and witnessed firsthand the misdirection of care and resources for those in behavioral health crisis. “You see the downstream effects of where the system fails in so many ways when you’re in those settings day after day,” he says. “How are we looking upstream to prevent these crisis situations from happening in the first place or recurring?” A hotline to help those in need The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, passed in 2020, made “988” the official nationwide three-digit behavioral health crisis number as of July 2022. This meant that, for the first time, those experiencing a behavioral health crisis anywhere in the country would only have to remember three digits to find the appropriate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline first launched in 2005 as a ten-digit number. At the time, Kana was working for the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA, which oversaw the number’s rollout. Over the years, she watched the Lifeline evolve, expanding to include options for Spanish language, veterans’ crises, and disaster distress help lines. “I've been along for the journey of the growth of the Lifeline and saw advocacy from the field trying to advance a three-digit calling number,” she says. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. The new easy-to-remember number, while hugely promising, raises at least one potential challenge. Call volume—rising over the years—has already begun skyrocketing since the new number launched. In the first week after 988 launched on July 16, 2022, the total call volume increased by 45 percent and Lifeline counselors answered 23,000 more calls, texts, and chats than the previous week. To help localities and stakeholders across the country prepare for this surge, the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), the firm's non-profit-generating entity that focuses on addressing public health challenges, has been involved in a range of nationwide efforts. This includes helping ensure states, contact centers, first responders, and community behavioral health providers know exactly what they need to meet demand—be it new strategies, workforce training, data infrastructure upgrades, or other support. Learn more about how we are accelerating sustainable inclusive growth Defining effective crisis care In December 2020, MHI came together with a group of national behavioral health and crisis-care stakeholders for a series of working sessions organized by Vibrant Emotional Health , the not-for-profit administrator of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; RI International , a global organization focused on the design and delivery of behavioral health crisis services; and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) . The goal was to help prepare for the launch of 988. MHI began by listening to 911 managers, mental health and substance-use treatment providers, contact center operators, and first responders to develop a consensus around the critical dimensions of crisis care. MHI gathered input from participating partners on what critical elements of community-based crisis care were necessary for the delivery of the 988 Lifeline. These conversations helped establish a shared understanding among stakeholders around the priorities of community-based crisis care: ensuring that anyone in crisis has someone to call, someone to help, and a safe place to go, as envisioned in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care . Simple as it sounds, this involves developing a continuum of care that includes the 988 crisis line staffed by local workers who can provide information, deescalate crises, and—when in-person support is needed—connect people with nearby services and relevant resources. Had this kind of response existed in 2019, Kana and her daughter would have had a place to go besides the ER; one that might have provided appropriate care and helped ease already constrained hospital capacity. About the McKinsey Health Institute The McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is an enduring, non-profit-generating global entity within McKinsey. MHI strives to catalyze actions across continents, sectors, and communities to achieve material improvements in health, adding years to life and life to years. Core to this aspiration is improving brain health. Brain disorders take a significant toll on both life expectancy and quality of life. In particular, the urgent and rising rate of mental health, substance use, and suicidal crises globally calls for a transformation of access to mobile crisis response and community-based crisis services. Through its foundational collaboration-based approach, MHI brings together the clinical expertise and public-sector missions of partners with McKinsey’s strengths in strategy, analytics, design, and organizational health. The result is meaningful impact on initiatives like the rollout of 988 in the United States and similar multistakeholder partnerships on crisis care around the world. Measuring costs and savings involved What would it take to ensure such crises are handled by trained professionals—including clinicians, peers, and other provider types—across a coordinated continuum of care in every community? To help answer this question, MHI began working with RI International in 2021 to build the Crisis Resource Need Calculator , a web-based cost calculator that allows local leaders to see a projection of annual behavioral health crisis care costs by county or state. The calculator enables them to understand the cost of providing for every individual in need of local, in-person crisis care based on SAMHSA’s national guidelines. It also considers how many mobile crisis teams states and counties would need, and what resources that would involve to build out to scale. The Crisis Resource Need Calculator also highlights potential healthcare savings available by making this shift in resources. Overall, the calculator estimates that with fully resourced community-based crisis systems in place, the United States could save a total of $34 billion in annual behavioral health costs otherwise spent on ER visits and inpatient beds. Helping build an action plan In addition to care costs, MHI also attempted to better assess responder readiness for the transition to 988. To do this, from November 2021 to March 2022, MHI partnered with state, federal, and local entities to develop detailed operational assessment playbooks to help key audiences, including states, tribes and territories, crisis contact operators, 911 centers, and behavioral health providers with understanding how they can prepare for the change. “The McKinsey team has been the glue that helped put this all together,” says Brian Hepburn, executive director of NASMHPD, which partnered with SAMHSA to prepare for 988’s 2022 rollout. “The effectiveness of the work is dependent on what happens between meetings, and McKinsey filled those gaps with needed data.” In March 2022, the 988 playbooks were released at a gathering of federal, state, and local stakeholders from across the field. They have since been shared with organizations like the National Council of State Legislators and the National Governors Association to help inform the efforts to scale 988. They’ve also been distributed by partners including the National Emergency Number Association , the National Association for State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors , and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing . Each playbook is geared toward a specific crisis-response group, including 911 professionals, Lifeline network contact centers, mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers, states, territories, and tribes. The playbooks were designed to help state and local leaders understand whether they’re properly staffed, funded, and prepared for 988 response and how to get there. “These playbooks offer stakeholders a self-assessment of their own readiness and links to specific recommendations and tools,” says Brian. Ensuring equitable care One of the ongoing challenges these playbooks attempt to tackle is creating equitable crisis care across communities. Ensuring underserved communities have their unique needs taken into consideration is one of the biggest challenges facing the current system, says Shelby Rowe, director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center . Shelby, a citizen of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma who has personally experienced suicidal episodes, sits on the board of RI International and advocates for marginalized groups and tribal communities to get access to the full spectrum of crisis care.
“If you’re a 15-year-old black trans girl, your experience asking for help in Brooklyn, New York is going to be very different from your experience asking for help in rural Oklahoma,” she says. Creating a more equitable system requires including diverse voices of those with lived experiences and addressing the underlying challenges and limitations facing specific communities. For example, tribal boundaries don’t always align to state lines, which keeps tribal communities from accessing crisis resource funding; the needs of vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ youth; the lack of access to crisis response in remote rural communities; the struggles people of color face when attempting to find medical or crisis help, and the list goes on. “We have an opportunity and an obligation to build a truly equitable crisis response system,” says Shelby. Creating a sustainable model Today, crisis response and stabilization services are primarily funded by federal, state, and local governments. Many crisis contact centers are transitioning from trained volunteer workforces to paid specialized staff. Yet an equitable, fully resourced continuum requires sustainable funding and commitment to meet diverse needs across communities. To support this, MHI and its collaborators, NASMHPD and SAMHSA, are working on several ongoing efforts. This includes examining healthcare claims to better understand how crisis services are paid for, developing a tool to forecast the number of healthcare workers a state or community needs for crisis care, and developing models and strategies to lessen the burden on the crisis workforce. The idea is that state and local governments, payers, and providers can use these resources to better support the current workforce, focus workforce development efforts, and plan for long-term financial sustainability. “The McKinsey team’s expertise in analytics helped identify some of the root-cause factors driving workforce shortages and what financing models can impact this journey along the crisis treatment system,” says SAMHSA’s John Palmieri. Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives. It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. All of these moving parts come together to steer a broader plan of action for crisis care in the United States. The five-year vision put forth by SAMHSA includes the goal of having 90 percent or more of all 988 calls answered in-state by the end of 2023, up from 71 percent in 2020 , and providing 80 percent or more of individuals in the United States with access to mobile crisis response and local services in the next two to five years. “What’s missing today is widespread, community-based approaches to managing suicidality, mental health crises, and substance use crises both for adults and kids,” says Kana. “Those are the services communities need and getting them actually costs much less and produces better outcomes.” Including for people like Reina. Since the initial frightening 2019 episode, Kana and her daughter had several others before the family found support through a local county-run organization offering in-home counseling and support to kids and families in need. Reina has since become an advocate for crisis support for teenagers and started a not for profit in her community to raise awareness for suicide prevention and youth mental health. “Behavioral health crisis care works and can save lives,” says Kana. “It’s our responsibility across the country to make these services available to people when and where they need them. It’s going take a lot of cross-sector collaboration to transform our nation’s response to behavioral health crises, and MHI is a committed partner along the way.” Related Articles Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z Addressing employee burnout: Are you solving the right problem?

"JobsOhio and the long-term, innovative revitalization of a state’s economy","How did Ohio become a destination for business growth? A new program turned the state’s economy around, with some help from McKinsey.",2022-10-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/jobsohio%20revitalizes%20states%20economy%20through%20innovative%20solutions/jobsohio-hero-small-1410686370-1536x864.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/jobsohio-revitalizes-states-economy-through-innovative-solutions,"JobsOhio and the long-term, innovative revitalization of a state’s economy October 6, 2022 Ohio’s economy, like so many in the Midwest and elsewhere, was struggling after the Great Recession. With the evisceration of manufacturing jobs, it needed a major transformation. In 2011, the state had a novel idea. Using profits from the beverage industry, Ohio formed a new entity—a first-of-its-kind, state-authorized non-profit—to stimulate economic growth through new industries: JobsOhio . Over the next decade, the state saw nearly one million jobs created or protected. McKinsey was a key early partner, helping develop JobsOhio’s growth plan that identified ten sectors with opportunities for employment, such as aerospace and aviation, healthcare, logistics and distribution, technology, and financial services. In 2010, Ohio ranked 49th for job growth rate in these ten sectors. By 2022, they ranked 20th in job growth rate and had added $13 billion in payroll. The state’s job creation was its best ever, but JobsOhio wanted to ensure its strategy would be effective going forward. In 2018, the initiative asked McKinsey to issue a report evaluating its performance. “JobsOhio was in a class by itself in terms of economic development organizations as far as dollars per job, attracting companies, capital investments, and more,” says Ben Safran , a partner at McKinsey who worked on the report. “But we also found it needed to address approaching headwinds in the broader macro economy.” Brendan Buescher , a McKinsey senior partner based in Cleveland, says the findings encouraged JobsOhio to think locally. “They were certainly performing well against comparable organizations,” says Brendan, “but we urged them to measure success against the needs of Ohioans.” The case for inclusive growth The report helped shape JobsOhio’s 2.0 strategy, which expanded its industry-focus to include a new emphasis on workforce, innovation, infrastructure and investment throughout the state. From this, JobsOhio developed Innovation Districts in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati—, multi-organization partnerships plan to create 60,000 jobs and establishing Ohio as a global leader in healthcare, life sciences, and technology in these three regions. As the new strategy was getting off the ground, COVID-19 rocked the state’s economy. Partnering with McKinsey again, JobsOhio quickly created a strategy for the pandemic economy, leading to the launch of Ohio to Work . Designed for displaced workers, Ohio to Work offered skills assessments, career coaching, virtual career fairs, and connection with employers who had signed on to interview or hire workers from the program. Specifically, McKinsey helped JobsOhio develop a unique program for reskilling and upskilling for higher-tech jobs: JobsOhio paid for tuition costs for technical degrees, and enrollees gradually repaid JobsOhio through a marginal percentage of their income—if they got a job that paid a good wage. Those repaid funds are not kept by JobsOhio; instead, the organization invests them in the next cohort. The program has been a success. Its funds have continued to replenish because of the high employment rate of participants. “With this strategy, not only is Ohio coming back strong from COVID-19, but Ohioans have the opportunity to pursue new careers they might have never thought possible,” says Ben. “A woman who had been a back-office worker and lost her job is now a nurse assistant—a whole new, stable career that feels like a calling. There are many powerful stories like this.” As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years. Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Most recently, the decade of growth and economic investment in Ohio helped attract a new investment from Intel, which announced earlier this year that it would be opening a new chip manufacturing plant in Central Ohio . This huge project is the largest single private-sector company investment in the state. It will create 3,000 new jobs at the plant with an average salary of $135,000. “As we have worked to improve the lives of all Ohioans, we've valued McKinsey's partnership over the last several years,” says JP Nauseef , president & CEO of JobsOhio. “Their data-driven approach combined with creative thinking led to solutions that fit the unique needs of our state—and supported our success in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The turnaround of the state’s jobs growth, Ben adds, suggests a potential way forward for other challenging situations. “Their success has been a paradigm shift,” says Ben Safran. “They are a model for growth in a changing economy.” related Tearing the ‘paper ceiling’: McKinsey supports effort driving upward mobility for millions of workers 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story"
McKinsey helps advance racial equity through Black leadership development and more,"In 2020, we made a public commitment to advance racial equity.

Over the past two years, more than 400 colleagues across the firm have dedicated countless hours and significant efforts to help turn our commitments into fully functioning operations, programs, and partnerships—with measurable results. Here, we look at the progress on three of those 10 Actions. While there is much more to be done, and we are not yet where we want to be, these examples highlight the progress we have made in the communities where we work and live. Our 10 actions toward racial equity Training 10,000+ Black leaders In the fall of 2020, we launched the Black Leadership Academy , based on our decades of experience in developing leaders within our firm and for our clients. “ We designed two marquee programs to accelerate the careers of Black professionals—one for early-to-mid-career managers and another to prepare senior executives for the C-suite,” recalls Sacha Yabili , a practice manager. “ We didn't know what sort of demand there would be.” In three months, 10,000 participants enrolled from 300 organizations across North America. Through topics such as the power of storytelling, leading in a crisis, business fundamentals, and effective sponsorship and mentorship, participants can gain the capabilities, mindsets, and networks to achieve their aspirations. “The program is pure gold—it’s the first time in my 25-years-long career I've been in the same room or Zoom with people who look like me, think like me,” said one participant. “I don't need to leave my identity at the door.” Building on this initial success, in 2021 our firm launched the Connected Leaders Academy for Asian and Hispanic and Latino leaders, and for Black leaders based in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. To date, over 40,000 participants from more than 900 organizations and 15 industries have enrolled. Developing actionable research “After George Floyd was murdered, a number of companies asked McKinsey about our perspective on the topic of racial equity and inclusive growth,” remembers Duwain Pinder , a partner. “We had done an initial report on the racial wealth gap , but clearly there was a need for more insight and support for organizations to take action, so we established the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility .” Our team of 50 experts and analysts have developed research on 20+ topics to date, helping to shape perceptions, quantify opportunities, and inform initiatives. “For example, we've been releasing a series of papers on how companies can serve Black consumers . In particular, we estimated that the bottom-line impact could be $300 billion, and found that Black consumers look for a holistic set of actions from a company—not just a product line or two; they want to know how a company diversifies its operations, supply chain, recruiting, philanthropy.” The team recently published a report on the state of racial equity in higher education , from 2013 to today. “It showed that despite the narrative that things are improving, in fact, they are not and there’s a lot farther to go,” shares Duwain. In addition, the insights are translated into practical tools, such as CityX, which evaluates racial equity in terms of neighborhood resources. Accelerating the impact of non-profits In 2020, McKinsey committed $200 million in pro bono work over the next ten years with organizations that are advancing racial equity. We’ve worked with 20+ partner organizations and launched more than 25 projects, engaging over 230 colleagues so far. Here are a few examples. Juntos Brazil has one of the largest Black populations in the world: 56% identifies as Black yet only 5% hold management positions. “We wanted to help young Black students advance from university to the workplace,” explains Vijay Gosula , a partner. “We created an annual conference called “Juntos,” which means ‘together’ in Portuguese.” Some 4,000 people have participated in the four events to date—both live and virtual. One attendee reflects: “Juntos was a watershed moment…for the first time, I saw a large group of young Black talent and leaders to inspire me. I connected with several companies and am pleased to work for one of those today. Juntos was my starting point.” Homeboy Industries Founded 30 years ago in the heart of Los Angeles, Homeboy Industries is the largest gang intervention and rehabilitation program in the world. It serves 8000+ individuals annually with clinical treatment, education, and workforce development programs. But Homeboy is more than its programs. “Our model here is family…it is kinship,” explains one participant. “This is what we wanted to help Homeboy reflect in its communications, programming, and  talent development model, which was designed to encompass everyone from senior leaders to clients who walked in the door yesterday,” explains Rebecca de Sa , an associate partner, who along with Kyle Nelson , an engagement manager, Bonnie Dowling , an associate partner, and Bryan Hancock , a partner, worked with the organization. Over the past two years, we have also worked with Homeboy to create roadmaps for their social enterprises, and strengthen their workforce pipeline. Greater Washington Partnership With 45 of the largest corporations in the Capital Region, the Partnership’s supply chain network is vast—and offered the potential to help local Black, Hispanic and Latino SMBs grow. A small team, led by associate partner Danielle Hinton , partner Fiyinfolu Oladiran , and senior partners, Nora Gardner and Scott Rutherford , sized the SMB landscape, interviewing companies to understand how they could fit into existing supply chains, and talked to large businesses about the challenges they faced diversifying their supplier base. As a result, the Greater Washington Partnership secured a $2.6 billion diverse procurement commitments from its board member organizations, part of a broader $4.7 billion commitment over five years. Then they created a marketplace for sharing data and best practices; and conceptualized a technical assistance approach for the smaller suppliers. “A powerful motivator was when we presented a ‘case for change’ in the local economy, challenging CEOs to ask each other, ‘Hey, how can we do more?’” recalls Fiyinfolu. related McKinsey commits $15 million to support Black-owned businesses and help fuel economic development How we’re building the next generation of Black executive leaders Never miss a story"
McKinsey&rsquo;s new Sustainability Academy helps clients upskill workers for the net-zero transition,"The new program, designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy, helps companies accelerate change through their employees.

Scaling supply chains and infrastructure, developing analytics tools to assess climate risk, reskilling workers in highly carbon-dependent markets, and more will have a massive impact on our ability to stabilize global temperatures in line with the 1.5C-degree pathway. To help our clients reach their sustainability and broader ESG goals, we have launched Sustainability Academy , a capability-building program that helps organizations better equip their talent for the net zero transition. “Making our economic system more sustainable and more inclusive is an imperative that is felt by all types of stakeholders, from governments and regulators, to clients, suppliers, and end consumers,” says partner Pietro Sorrentino , who helps lead Sustainability Academy. “Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that: help companies accelerate change by supporting them in building new knowledge for their employees.” The program was designed by consultants from McKinsey Sustainability and learning experts from McKinsey Academy —our capability building center of excellence—and follows a simple approach: acquire, apply, and sustain. First, Sustainability Academy offers formal learning experiences to help talent acquire new knowledge and skills through practice and feedback. Second, teams apply these mindsets and capabilities in a real-world context, where impact materializes. Finally, we help organizations sustain new practices and habits to unlock lasting behavioral change. Sustainability Academy has launched with two foundational programs. Our Executive Masterclass kickstarts transformations by aligning senior executives with the mindsets and skills required to deliver their sustainability agendas. Sustainability Transformation Essentials, meanwhile, helps clients develop enterprise-wide awareness of core sustainability concepts, including the climate transition, solving the net-zero equation, and capturing new business opportunities. The program is already driving impact with clients. Recently, we partnered with a Fortune 500 company to accelerate their net-zero journey, helping them become an industry ESG leader. In this case, the client had articulated clear sustainability targets—including reaching net zero for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. But leaders needed to equip their teams with the practical skill sets needed to engage both internally and externally with stakeholders and suppliers. This is a common challenge: industry benchmarks show that in some sectors, nearly 100 percent of companies have defined and communicated sustainability strategies, but only 40 percent believe they have sufficient internal knowledge and capabilities to achieve their targets. Given that about 90 percent of our client’s emissions fell into Scope 3 (within the supply chain and not directly owned by the organization), equipping their talent with capabilities to engage their suppliers was particularly important. Sustainability Academy The company asked McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy to help their talent build the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they needed to engage with their suppliers to reduce emissions across the value chain. Together, we co-developed a multimodal journey—integrating fieldwork, digital learning, and live workshops—to help the client’s category managers prepare for conversations with suppliers. This journey looked at key emissions categories, such as distribution and logistics, identifying the sustainability opportunities to discuss with suppliers and internal stakeholders. It also provided modules on how to best lead the supplier discussions and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The same client also sought to increase spend with diverse companies by more than $1 billion across their tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We partnered with the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion team to create robust diversity programs and track against diversity targets. These efforts culminated in a virtual supplier summit with more than 200 suppliers and more than 1,000 internal and external attendees. Private organizations have a central role to play to decarbonize our economy, but to do so they must build skills and capabilities that today they do not have. McKinsey’s Sustainability Academy was created exactly to do that... These efforts delivered significant impact on both the sustainability and inclusion fronts. Supplier commitments to science-based targets increased by more than 50 percent from the baseline, and gains were made on supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion, with additional commitments on tier 2 reporting and identification of new business opportunities with tier 1 diverse suppliers. “Completing the online training modules, supported by the virtual forum sessions and open office hours, helped our client’s people build a fact-base for working with their suppliers, which enabled them to have productive conversations at the supplier summit,” says partner Maria Fernandez . “Today, this work is the foundation upon which their multi-year ESG transformation resides.” If your organization is interested in working with Sustainability Academy, please email us . related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story"

A quarter of companies don’t grow at all , and just one in eight achieve 10 percent growth annually, while only one in 10 have held steady in the S&P 500 with above GDP growth for more than 30 years. To reverse this trend, a key move leaders need to make is to better tech-enable their organization. This means acquiring and developing the right technology, the right capabilities, and the right talent: those who bring the kind of analytical depth and foresight necessary to turn data into actionable insights. McKinsey Sciences for Growth helps organizations do just that, bringing together the best tech-enabled capabilities, including more than 1,000 leading global practitioners and an ability to stitch together a comprehensive technology stack to generate impact across strategy, AI-powered insights, and more. Through its distinctive approach and world-class IP, McKinsey Sciences for Growth helps the boldest leaders accelerate their growth ambitions. McKinsey Sciences for Growth: Top tech-enabled capabilities AI-powered insights: Drawing on QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey ’s capabilities, we help you unlock the power of AI to make sense of complex data, pinpoint where the greatest value lies, and sustain impact over time. Fit-for-growth technology: We bring value-building capabilities to you and your teams, and a suite of proprietary technologies and platforms that act as force multipliers of innovation and improved performance. Delivery and sustainable operations: From implementation to operations, we help you deliver organizational success and sustain the full impact of transformations across digital commerce, customer experience, pricing, sales growth, and marketing. “Growth is always a priority, but it remains challenging to achieve,” says McKinsey senior partner Greg Kelly , who leads our Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice . “Developing stronger functional growth capabilities is essential to re-energizing organic growth. The growth leaders that consistently outperform today have tech-enablement at the heart of their functional capabilities.” “We’re delighted to join forces to bring McKinsey Sciences for Growth to life,” says senior partner Alex Singla , global co-Leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. “This enables our clients to unlock the power of AI by drawing on the deep expertise that lies within QuantumBlack, with the deep domain expertise from our Growth, Marketing & Sales colleagues. We can realize unimagined opportunities when we bring together the best technical skills and industry knowledge with AI and machine learning capabilities.” Already, McKinsey Sciences for Growth has enabled impact for clients across industries by working in areas such as personalization, sales growth, revenue growth management, digital commerce, and predictive analytics. “The future of growth requires a true at-scale ability to get down to the most granular levels of your business, whether that ’ s at a customer level, a store level, or a product level,” says McKinsey partner Maura Goldrick . “That’s why it’s so critical to harness analytical horsepower and distinctive intelligence to decision making throughout the entire journey.” For example, a consumer electronics manufacturer deployed CustomerOne to revamp primary customer interfaces, including creating a real-time customized website experience. The move helped increase total revenue generated through their direct-to-consumer channel from five to 20 percent within 15 months. “Our experience from helping hundreds of clients drive large, at-scale growth transformations tells us that when you combine strategy, data, technology, and human-led insights, organizations can achieve superior performance and outsized growth,” says senior partner Stephan Zimmermann , a global co-leader of McKinsey Sciences for Growth. “In partnership with McKinsey Digital , we bring the best of our capability-building power from across the firm, including the best and the brightest in AI, digital, operations, and technology.” In another instance, the team worked with major a healthcare system provider seeking to become more customer-centric to stand up agile teams across digital marketing, journey design, and advanced analytics to develop the necessary capabilities and capture value.

"At Climate Week, McKinsey helps explore financing for nature at scale","Leaders across industries gathered for a McKinsey roundtable on the challenges and opportunities in scaling up investment in nature-based solutions to protect, restore, and benefit from the natural world.",2022-10-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/at%20climate%20week%20mckinsey%20helps%20explore%20financing%20nature%20at%20scale/climateweek-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/at-climate-week-mckinsey-helps-explore-financing-nature-at-scale,"At Climate Week, McKinsey helps explore financing for nature at scale October 26, 2022 The natural world is both precious and the backbone of stable communities, industries, and climate systems. But despite early successes and excitement around nature-based solutions to social and environmental challenges, a gap remains between what’s being done today and what’s needed tomorrow. McKinsey recently brought together dozens of leaders—from heads of startups to global institutional investors—during Climate Week in New York City for a roundtable on the theme of “Financing nature-based solutions at scale.” The conversation that followed included the presentation of three case studies and a group problem-solving session on each. “These conversations were real, honest, and involved stakeholders at every level,” says associate partner Caroline De Vit , who helps lead McKinsey’s work on natural capital. “And in each one, we talked about how to make these solutions work—financially, for local communities, for everyone.” The first case study, for example, focused on Pacific Island Tuna and Walmart’s commitment to provide the market with more sustainably sourced tuna. Afterwards, participants looked at what it would take to scale the partnership beyond where it is currently focused, in the Marshall Islands, to other Parties to the Nauru Agreement , which controls 50 percent of the global supply of skipjack tuna. These conversations were real, honest, and involved stakeholders at every level. Another was presented by Taking Root , which centered on the opportunity to create long-term value from forests for smallholder farmers who take part in reforestation programs to accelerate the scale-up of nature-based solutions carbon credits. Community land use decisions that hinge on economic livelihoods and long-term planning that creates value for all stakeholders will help ensure agricultural and forestry nature-based solutions scale sustainably. And a third centered on Indonesia’s PT Rimba Makmur Utama , which is helping the Katingan Peatland Restoration and Conservation Project restore and protect peat swamp forest, and the challenges and opportunities they face. Over the course of the day, several widely applicable ideas on better enabling nature-based solutions at scale emerged. Read on for participants’ takeaways from the session. Build trust early among all stakeholders For a nature-based solution to work, the value proposition must make sense for everyone involved. Talk with developers, NGOs, universities, technology innovators, corporates, and other investors early to understand if a solution design aligns with investor impact priorities and risk and return expectations (and vice versa). Use these discussions as well to surface new ideas on everything from tech to business models to financing. Think beyond carbon credits While carbon credits can play an important role to monetize nature-based solutions, it’s important to consider complementary self-sustaining revenues (such as sustainable agriculture or fishing). These will help the long-term economics by embedding permanent change into the fabric of the business. As markets mature, other types of credits could unfold to support nature. Design for scalability All pilots should also be designed and run with the idea of scaling in the future. With this built into the mindset and the structure of the project, it will be easier to maximize impact and fully leverage knowledge and experience gains. Use data and technology for a fuller picture on returns Measuring and tracking livelihood, health, and nature-related outcomes, especially at the local level, can unlock financing and ensure long-term success. Some leaders in the space are following a landscape-based approach, focusing on economic and social outcomes at the local level. Participants also identified innovations from other interventions beyond nature such as public health, microfinance, or human rights. Involve local communities for long-term success People living in the communities a nature-based solution will impact need to be on board. These fishermen, farmers, and families should have continued incentive to participate, and financing models must be self-sustaining. The most successful projects are championed by local communities, and building that trust takes time. related Nature risk is the next challenge that demands a global solution Blue carbon: The potential of coastal and oceanic climate action Never miss a story"

The program aims to reach an additional 150,000 learners in 2023. Forward is designed to equip the next generation of young talent with practical skills necessary to succeed in the future of work. Specifically, the program focuses on the leadership, business, and digital skills that are relevant and transferrable across industries and roles and targets people with less than five years of work experience. “This is one important way we deliver on our commitment to enabling sustainable and inclusive growth—by upskilling hundreds of thousands of young people that need practical skills to thrive in the workforce, and in turn participate in fueling economies of the region,” says McKinsey senior partner Viktor Hediger , who leads the firm’s social responsibility efforts in the region. “We believe that begins with unlocking the potential of the region’s youth and building an inclusive workforce and community that reflects society.” May Wazzan , who leads Forward for McKinsey, believes that what makes the program particularly impactful—beyond its practical content—is the real time interaction among learners and McKinsey experts along with the ongoing connectivity the program provides its alumni. “We know that this generation of young talent is beginning their careers in an increasingly complex, fast-paced world of work,” May says. “Forward helps create a global community for young professionals to help boost their confidence, grow in their careers, and build connections with people all around the world.” Below, three members of that community share their unique stories about what joining Forward has meant to them. Meet Bilgesu from Turkey Being an entrepreneur at a young age and in an emerging industry can be overwhelming. As a young sustainable fashion entrepreneur, Bilgesu from Turkey was on a search to grow her communications, leadership, problem-solving, and digital skills and found the Forward learning program to be the perfect match. “My life changed because I learned how to set intentions, how to structure my work, how to focus and manage my time intentionally,” she says. “Step by step, I started believing in myself more.” Meet Kalada from Nigeria Kalada, a Forward alumnus from Nigeria, conquered the uncertainty he felt as a fresh graduate through the McKinsey Forward program. In less than a year, he made a big jump in his career trajectory. Kalada is also now an active member of the Forward alumni community, volunteering his time to pay it forward to new program learners. “Forward gave me skills, recognition, and exposure,” he says. “That gave me confidence and made me believe in my value.” Meet Bedour from UAE Bedour is a graphic designer and Forward alumna from the UAE. Early in her career, she felt susceptible to creative blocks and fear of failure. Today, however, she uses practical tools she gained through Forward that help her overcome these challenges and reach her full potential. “[The program] gave me the confidence to be more decisive,” she says, “and not be afraid of trying something different.” Apply now Forward is available across Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, Turkey, and Azerbaijan. Participants have access to exclusive McKinsey insights, virtual workshops, and group assignments. Graduates become members of a global alumni network of the program. To date, 85 percent of them report having experienced a boost in their performance that is noticeable by their peers and managers; 96 percent of graduates say they are more confident in their skills; and 92 percent have experienced growth in their role or career.

"McKinsey acquires SCM Connections, deepening supply-chain transformation capabilities","The acquisition strengthens McKinsey’s supply-chain consulting, bringing greater tech-enablement capabilities to end-to-end supply chain planning transformations.",2022-11-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20acquires%20scm%20connections/disc-hero-small-1193475928-1536x864-2.jpg,"Acquisitions,Operations",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-acquires-scm-connections,"McKinsey acquires SCM Connections, deepening supply-chain transformation capabilities November 2, 2022 “We joke that one of the results of the supply chain crisis has been that our parents finally understand what we do,” says Kristi Naidech , chief operating officer of SCM Connections, a leader in technology-enabled supply-chain transformations that joins McKinsey this week to strengthen our expertise in supply-chain strategy, value creation, and growth. The disruptions of the last few years have pushed this “back-office” function into the spotlight, making supply chain transformation one of the top five priorities for many CEOs. As businesses grappled with crises including plant shutdowns, bottlenecks in shipping lanes, and labor shortages, they quickly realized that moving things from A to B efficiently was no longer enough. Supply chains needed to be flexible, resilient, and sustainable. “This is what we had been helping clients with for years; if your supply chain has a hiccup, your company can shut down,” explains Mike Raftery , CEO of SCM Connections. “Today, supply chains require multiple backups, redundant options, alternate sources. Do you have a backup plan for your backup plan? The ability to manage this complexity with ‘what if’ scenarios is a requirement.” The proven technology skills and capability building from SCM Connections will complement McKinsey’s strategic insights, planning-process acumen, and deep organizational, cultural, and mindset transformation experience. “With this acquisition, we can help clients with their advanced planning transformations, from step one to step ten, with no handoffs and complete ownership of impact, which has been an unmet need for many clients,” explains Mike Doheny , the McKinsey senior partner who leads our manufacturing and supply chain work . “This includes developing the organizational capability and mindset shift necessary to capture and sustain the value. In addition, we will enhance these processes with our QuantumBlack expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning.” In business for almost a decade, SCM Connections has more than 45 experts, many of whom have experienced or led major software and ERP deployments as both clients and systems integrators. The firm managed extraordinary demand during the pandemic, helping numerous companies convert bricks-and-mortar stores into e-commerce channels almost overnight, reinventing networks, digitizing processes, and building resilience into infrastructures. “What we like about SCM Connections is that they often get called in to fix tech-enabled transformations that have gone wrong,” says Ketan Shah , the McKinsey partner who leads our supply chain planning work and technology alliances in the supply chain space. “This takes a real understanding of the supply chain and experts who know what they are doing with the technology and the process.” McKinsey and SCM Connections have a proven relationship. For example, during the pandemic  we helped a billion-dollar enterprise lay the groundwork for its upcoming advanced planning and scheduling (APS) implementation. “We brought very complementary strengths,” says Ketan. “We like the ‘popcorn’ of ideas, the excitement of problem solving, and figuring out how insights from our research and experience will translate into concrete next steps to create value for our clients.” Working together confirmed that both firms share a culture that values client service above all. “We’ve always judged our projects on the results: Were we able to improve transparency? Is the algorithm delivering better insights? Are the KPIs improving? This focus on delivering value makes us an incredible fit with McKinsey,” observed Patrick Green , chief technology officer of SCM Connections. In addition to complete transformations, the newly integrated team will help clients across industries stand up SCM initiatives with early-phase diagnostics, business-case development, and road mapping, as well as undertake interventions in existing SCM transformation projects to unlock untapped value. With this acquisition, we can help clients with their advanced planning transformations, from step one to step ten, with no handoffs and complete ownership of impact, which has been an unmet need for many clients. SCM Connections has built a diverse talent pool, supplementing supply-chain planning skills with experts in mathematics, industrial engineering, and economics; and 45 percent of the team are women. “Such different perspectives make our solutions stronger, more creative,” Kristi says. Mike Doheny can attest to the effectiveness of that creativity. “Advanced planning software tends to be 50 percent customizable and their experts know it inside and out. They are incredibly adept at tuning the software around business processes that need to change, creating the opportunity to actually capture the value.” The SCM Connections team will now have a chance to work on exciting new challenges, gain access to greater resources, and expand on a global basis. “What really excites us is that with McKinsey we have the potential to change our business away from an hourly-based, transactional, tech implementation model into a results-based relationship,” says Mike Raftery. “I think this is way overdue, and we’re hoping this new relationship can help lead the industry in that direction.” related McKinsey acquires S4G Consulting to help businesses ignite growth Why we acquired a company that specializes in spend analytics Never miss a story"
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never been to this kind of event before&rdquo;: McKinsey research accelerates Black economic mobility,"In just five years, the Black Economic Forum, an annual gathering of cross-sector Black leaders that McKinsey serves as a knowledge partner, has produced results. A leading insurer&rsquo;s case is a prime example.",2022-11-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/novel%20approach%20accelerates%20black%20economic%20mobility/bef-hero-eddie-jim-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Our Publishing",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/novel-approach-accelerates-black-economic-mobility,"“I’d never been to this kind of event before”: McKinsey research accelerates Black economic mobility Jim Lowery, right, the first Black consultant at McKinsey, at the Black Economic Forum with Princeton University's Dr. Eddie S. Glaude Jr. November 14, 2022 What happens when Black executives, government officials, nonprofit leaders, and scholars join forces to accelerate Black economic mobility? We’re beginning to find out. The Black Economic Forum (BEF) recently marked its fifth anniversary. The annual event convenes Black leaders from the public, private, and social sectors—drawing over 200 attendees this year—partnering to increase economic mobility in US Black communities and support the next generation of Black businesses and entrepreneurs. “The vision was that this would be a research-backed event, where people wouldn’t just connect, but generate ideas and take action,” says Duwain Pinder , a McKinsey partner who’s worked on BEF since its inception in 2018. BEF grew out of the Summer Executive Workshop Series, an annual convening on Martha’s Vineyard of Black leaders hosted by the Beta Iota Boulé Foundation . The oldest Black fraternity in America, its work focuses on leadership development. Its former leaders saw an opportunity to partner with the Executive Leadership Council , a national organization composed of current and former Black CEOs and senior executives. McKinsey joined as a knowledge partner to provide insights-based recommendations to advance the mission of Black economic mobility. This unique model is what attracted Dr. Cindy Pace, MetLife’s global chief of diversity, equity, and inclusion, to BEF. “The conversations aren’t philosophical—they get into micro actions you can immediately take into your organization,” she says. “It’s an intimate setting with Black entrepreneurs, executives and CEOs and other leaders. I’d never been to this kind of event before.” McKinsey’s research on investing for equity helped Cindy find new avenues for meeting MetLife’s DEI goals. “McKinsey transcends being a professional services firm. It’s a thought leader in Black economic mobility,” says Cindy. “They’ve pushed us to think differently about Black consumers, supplier and business diversity—and to take that into our workplaces.” The firm’s research report Race in the workplace: The frontline experience provided an ‘aha’ moment for Cindy: Only 4 percent of frontline workers move into corporate roles, despite 70 percent reporting they would like to, due in part to frontline workers being less likely to understand and be involved in a company’s DEI initiatives. “We didn’t want this to be our ‘broken rung,’” Cindy says. “We realized there was a low-hanging fruit of doing a better job communicating our message.” MetLife has since implemented digital tools designed for employees in call centers and customer service areas to better engage with DEI efforts with the goal of career advancement. Supplier and business diversity is top of mind for companies like MetLife. Duwain says it has always been a topic of importance at BEF and was a major focus this year. “Corporations can have a major impact on economic mobility through the suppliers they ask for, and not just food or janitorial services, but professional services,” says Duwain. “This has downstream impacts on the broader economy. That’s a specificity we didn’t have five years ago that’s really helping corporations take action.” For MetLife’s part, the company’s Supplier and Inclusion Development Program elevates diverse suppliers across the company’s supply chain, ultimately advancing long-term economic growth in the communities where they live and work. Since the inception of the program in 2003, the company has engaged with over 200 diverse business partners, spending approximately $3.5 billion. Earlier this year, MetLife announced a commitment to reach $5 billion in spend with diverse suppliers by 2030, and annually report the economic impact of MetLife’s diverse supply chain. “Spend on procurement isn’t the same as investment in businesses,” Cindy says, citing McKinsey’s research on supplier diversity . “If we invest in our business suppliers so they can grow, they’ll hire within their communities and make a broader impact.” BEF is focused on its agenda of action and progress, expanding beyond the summer convening. It recently held its first city-specific meeting with cross-sector leaders in Detroit, and industry roundtables on technology and education, with more in the works. Duwain, whose work at McKinsey is focused on cross-sector inclusive growth and includes work with higher education institutions, among them historically Black colleges and universities, says the continued success of the forum is vital for doing this kind of work. “The forum is a way to ensure that I am understanding the needs of the leaders who are living this day to day,” he says.

Ecuador is the next step of that journey of extending our presence in different countries, finding those organizations that can benefit from best practices and perspectives from a firm like ours, and growing our talent pools.” This year, in addition to Ecuador, we also opened an office in Montevideo, Uruguay , and acquired LOBO , a digital marketing operations firm in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “McKinsey has long served the financial institutions of Ecuador, and we’re very excited about other areas including sustainability, agriculture, retail and consumer, all of which offer opportunities for helping to create lasting, inclusive growth,” adds Carlos. In terms of agriculture and aquaculture, Ecuador is the largest exporter of bananas in the world and a major exporter of shrimp. “In addition to becoming more sustainable, we can help local agricultural businesses and fisheries become more competitive by adapting digital and analytics solutions, such as ACRE , to significantly improve yields and reduce costs,” says Carlos. Ecuador is a dollarized economy, with almost 20 million consumers. The retail industry is vibrant and informal, with about half of the entire grocery sector functioning through small, local stores. Expertise and technology for strategic sourcing, lean manufacturing, customer analytics, and digital expertise could help retailers grow revenue through new, resilient go-to-market strategies and channels. “It’s a big agenda,” acknowledges Carlos, “one that relies on recruiting and developing local talent, including attracting Ecuadorians from home and abroad.

November 29, 2022 Citing new McKinsey Global Institute research on global flows, Bob Sternfels urged leaders to reimagine, rather than retreat from, globalization in a ‘ firestarter ’ speech at the 2022 Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. “After four decades of increasing connectedness, we are facing the greatest challenge to globalization that our generation of leaders has ever seen,” Bob said. “Instead of bowing to decoupling, can we instead reimagine globalization to try to drive sustainable and inclusive growth?” You can read edited highlights from Bob ’s speech below, or head to Bloomberg to watch the session, Resilience in an interdependent world , in its entirety. On our interconnected world On pressures to decouple The pandemic disrupted supply chains and people movements, and the war in Ukraine has upset commodity flows. This has been incredibly costly. Energy prices at the highest the since 1973, and supply-chain pressure is at the highest level that we’ve ever seen. Critically, global food prices have soared, increasing the pressure on the most vulnerable. Recent statistics show that 345 million people are suffering from a food crisis due to the war in Ukraine. In response to all this, we hear words that focus on breaking apart: independence, on-shoring, friend-shoring, localization. These words are dominating debates today. On the need for continued collaboration No region, no country is an island today. The McKinsey Global Institute has done some modeling on this, and they estimate that up to 10 to 40 percent of global GDP is dependent on staying connected. Additionally, as we think about the world’s most complicated problems — climate, health, security, innovation — we don’t have a hope of solving these issues independently. These are problems that require collaboration not separation. And finally, solving the world’s supply/demand mismatch with talent can’t be solved individually. If we look out to 2050 and take Europe and China alone, they will lose 120 million workers from the workforce by 2050. The only places that can hope to make that up are India and Africa. That requires collaboration. On the way forward How do we do it? I’m humble enough to know that I certainly don’t have all the answers. I’m not sure that anybody does. I will offer five ideas that might be part of the answer. The first is, I wonder if we could start talking about diversification of trade rather than reduction or isolation of trade. To do this, we need to collaborate on standards and we need mechanisms to enforce them, not only on trade but on things like IP. We need to invest in talent ; here’s where I think the private sector can play a huge role to meet the needs for that 30 year mismatch that I spoke about earlier. Increasing capital flows will be absolutely critical to make sure that emerging economies participate equally in the growth that this can drive. Finally, access— access for all . Think about small- and medium-sized enterprise and the barriers they face in cross-border trade; and also access for women, minorities, and other vulnerable populations. If we think about immigration right, everybody can come along. On what could be gained What could this decade look like if we reimagine globalization versus defaulting to decoupling? This is not an easy path but it is an inspiring one. Our models show that there’s a potential to grow GDP this decade 30 to 50 percent. There’s a potential, if we focus on training, to actually reskill and upskill 100 million workers to solve this talent problem. We can add 45 billion years of life to those alive today on the planet by more access to health care through technologies that exist today. And with current climate technologies, we can take out 74 gigatons of carbon this decade. I think we face a choice as we go forward in these turbulent times. I think we can retreat, and start using words like localization, decoupling. But the consequences could be quite severe. The alternative is that we can be courageous and try to reimagine globalization, recognizing its faults but also recognizing its strengths. I’d argue this is the time for courage, and we should not be thinking about retreat. We should be thinking about reimagining. related Bob Sternfels: “We should accept nothing less” than sustainable and inclusive growth Never miss a story"
McKinsey Sustainability and Moody&rsquo;s Analytics join forces to help banks build climate resilience,The new collaboration can help banks measure and manage their portfolio exposure to climate risks and financed emissions as they navigate the risks and opportunities in the net-zero transition.,2022-11-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20sustainability%20and%20moodys%20analytics%20join%20forces%20to%20help%20banks%20build%20climate%20resilience/moodys-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-sustainability-and-moodys-analytics-join-forces-to-help-banks-build-climate-resilience,"McKinsey Sustainability and Moody’s Analytics join forces to help banks build climate resilience November 30, 2022 The physical manifestations of a changing climate are visible across the globe, as are their socioeconomic impacts. Governments and organizations around the world increasingly recognize that the physical risks associated with a changing climate will continue to build up until net-zero emissions are achieved. However, decarbonizing the global economy to reach net-zero will require significant economic transformation. In fact, our research indicates $9.2 trillion in annual average spending on physical assets through 2050 may be needed, with 70 percent of this going towards low-emissions products and enabling infrastructure, such as wind and solar generation. Achieving this aggressive target requires urgent and decisive action, and banks as well as other financial institutions can play a pivotal role in the large-scale capital reallocation likely needed to reach net zero—in addition to managing their own risks and opportunities. To support banks on navigating these issues, McKinsey Sustainability and Moody’s Analytics have joined forces. The collaboration brings together complementary strengths of both companies, including Moody’s deep analytical capabilities, particularly in modeling the physical risks of climate change and translating them into credit risk impact, and McKinsey Sustainability’s extensive expertise in modeling transition risk and advising banks on integrating climate risk into business processes, and reducing financed emissions. Cindy Levy , a senior partner with McKinsey Sustainability, says, “We are thrilled to be collaborating with Moody’s Analytics to strengthen banks’ resiliency to the present and future risks from climate change, and to align their portfolios to net-zero pathways.” McKinsey Sustainability and Moody’s will work together to help clients effectively manage climate risk. This includes physical risk: using catastrophe-based models to simulate the impact of physical hazards; transition risk: using models that forecast the impact of the transition to a low-carbon economy; and credit risk: translating the financial impact of physical and transition risk into the credit profile of borrowers, loans, and assets using robust credit models across all major asset classes. We are thrilled to be collaborating with Moody’s Analytics to strengthen banks’ resiliency to the present and future risks from climate change, and to align their portfolios to net-zero pathways. For one U.S. bank, McKinsey Sustainability and Moody’s have helped measure the credit impact of physical and transition risks on their Commercial Real Estate and Residential Real Estate portfolios under different climate scenarios, which has enabled the bank to take more informed decisions in credit portfolio management. For example, they are re-examining their approach to borrower and transaction-level risk assessments to better factor in the impact of climate risk on the credit profile. The collaboration will enable banks to model climate exposure at a number of different levels across sectors and regions, and help them to quantify— at a granular level and in financial terms—climate risk across their portfolios. “Banks are looking for better tools to integrate climate risk into their decision-making, whether they are looking at credit assessment, stress testing and scenario analysis, or regulatory needs,” said Jacob Grotta, General Manager, Banking Solutions at Moody’s Analytics. “By working with McKinsey Sustainability, we are able to provide broader, comprehensive solutions to clients – helping them understand what needs to be done with advisory and consulting and how to do it with the tools, data, and analytics Moody’s is known for.” The collaboration builds on the efforts of both McKinsey Sustainability’s Planetrics solution, which helps financial institutions assess climate risk and opportunity, and the Moody’s Analytics suite of climate solutions . related Launching McKinsey Sustainability: Our new platform for helping clients innovate to net zero McKinsey’s new Sustainability Academy helps clients upskill workers for the net-zero transition Never miss a story"
McKinsey named a Leader in AI Service Providers by Forrester,"The Forrester Wave&trade;: AI Service Providers, Q4 2022 report lauded McKinsey for &ldquo;addressing AI holistically: as a technology, an operational model, and a strategic asset.&rdquo;&nbsp;",2022-12-01T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20named%20a%20leader%20in%20ai%20service%20providers%20by%20forrester/forrester22-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,"Awards,AI & Analytics",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-named-a-leader-in-ai-service-providers-by-forrester,"McKinsey named a Leader in AI Service Providers by Forrester December 1, 2022 McKinsey has been named a Leader, the highest designation, in The Forrester Wave™: AI Service Providers, Q4 2022 report. Forrester evaluated 12 firms, assessing them on 29 criteria grouped into the categories of current offering, strategy, and market presence. We received the highest possible rating in criteria including AI talent, vision, and market approach. “McKinsey & Company leads enterprises with end-to-end AI transformation,” the Forrester report notes, also recognizing that “McKinsey addresses AI holistically: as a technology, an operational model, and a strategic asset.” The report also notes that McKinsey “[places] a heavy emphasis on ROI.” McKinsey acquired the AI arm of our firm, QuantumBlack , in 2015, and the Forrester report points out that this move “continues to deliver top-notch data science talent.” QuantumBlack has scaled significantly since then to over 40 locations worldwide. QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey “We are proud and humbled by the recognition,” says senior partner Alexander Sukharevsky who along with Alex Singla leads QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. “In the past 18 months, we have invested heavily in building our talent bench as well as our technology. Our communities are knit together by a culture of intense collaboration and continuous learning, making it a home for the best global AI talent. ” Our technologists have built industry-specific accelerators that incorporate much of the required code and tooling, speeding up development and deployment time while reducing risk. The Forrester report notes that these “well-developed engineering and technology protocols, and over 25 industry assets, set the bar for the market.” Our AI experts have also been working with clients to assess the practical business benefits of emerging technologies, such as digital twins and AI for data quality, and help them proactively address the requirements for digital trust in the products and experiences that use AI, digital technologies, and data. “To us, this recognition is a testament to our innovative work and the investment our firm has been making in AI talent, technologies, knowledge, and innovation,” says Alex Singla. “The biggest challenge we see now is in helping companies advance from a handful of pilots to running hundreds or thousands of models on an AI platform and gaining the value that comes from scaling.” Achieving that scale takes innovation on multiple fronts. “We have focused on end-to-end AI, helping clients develop the thinking and planning for the people, processes, and technologies required for scaling. We believe that MLOps is part of the answer to scale,” explains Nayur Khan , a partner at McKinsey. “This involves establishing an assembly line for developing and deploying AI products that end users love–bringing the right skills, from product and design thinking to data engineering and machine learning, to cloud and software engineering. Finally, baking in legal, ethical, and compliance checks and balances in an automated fashion.” With MLOps, businesses can quickly solve use cases and scale their processes due to high interoperability and reusable components. This is somewhat new to data science–just as good software engineering and DevOps were core to improving software delivery. Business leaders who are serious about the value of AI are increasingly looking to MLOps to help unlock it. For example, in the past year, we’ve partnered with a global life-sciences company to help them transform a set of fragmented AI labs into an enterprise-wide MLOps solution architecture. Some 400 data scientists from 30 teams worldwide have already developed and deployed more than 25 AI use cases across research, clinical, and commercial business areas, delivering business impact while improving productivity and reliability. McKinsey senior partner Kia Javanmardian leads our MLOps service line. “In the early period of AI, companies created models but didn’t ensure sustainability and scalability,” Kia says. “Now we need to ensure the infrastructure is in place from the onset to sustain and scale impact from analytics. This will require us to be deeply involved with defining and implementing our clients’ AI technology architecture.” As this latest Forrester rating confirms, that’s a role we’re well-suited to play. related McKinsey named a “Leader” in AI Why hybrid intelligence is the future of artificial intelligence at McKinsey Never miss a story"
Diverse gathering of LGBTQ+ senior leaders tackles the community&rsquo;s global challenges,"Hosted by McKinsey, The Alliance forms a global community of LGBTQ+ senior leaders, offering knowledge and support to take on pressing issues facing queer people in business and society.",2022-12-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/diverse%20gathering%20of%20lgbtq%20leaders%20tackles%20todays%20toughest%20challenges/alliance-hero-small-event-1536x864.jpg,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/diverse-gathering-of-lgbtq-senior-leaders-tackles-the-communitys-global-challenges,"Diverse gathering of LGBTQ+ senior leaders tackles the community’s global challenges December 6, 2022 Driving LGBTQ+ equality and greater acceptance in the workplace and society is a cornerstone of McKinsey’s work. It’s this ethos that gave rise to The Alliance , a convening of LGBTQ+ leaders hosted by McKinsey since 2018 . This year in Athens, The Alliance held its first in-person gathering since 2019 , after two years of virtual programming due to COVID-19. Through key research and by drawing a range of voices to the event, The Alliance aims to provide attendees with the powerful network and knowledge necessary to take on the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ people in their organizations and communities. The global director of this year’s event, McKinsey associate partner David Baboolall , discusses the event’s increase in diversity, speakers from high-risk places, such as Ukraine, and the LGBTQ+ refugees that joined the participants at this year’s event. What was it like being back in person after three years away? There was a lot of pent-up excitement to see each other again, to be in the unique environment of being surrounded by other queer leaders in a truly safe place and to make lifelong friends. It was an opportunity to reflect on the wins and losses of our community over the last couple of years and to welcome new Alliance members, with one third of attendees being new to the community this year. What was different about this year’s meeting? For one thing, the diversity. Forty percent of participants were people of color, and we saw increases in gender and geographic diversity as well. Nearly one in five 2022 summit members were Black queer individuals, which didn’t happen in past Alliances. These Black gay men, women, and gender non-conforming folks of diverse sexualities kept saying, “ This is special.” We worked hard on increasing diversity, so that was rewarding. What messages did participants from high-risk geographies share? One speaker from Ukraine talked about the displacement happening there. It’s a different experience for queer people. Basic necessities and medication have become hard to come by, transgender women with a male marker on documents are barred from leaving Ukraine, and in order to leave, a person needs to undergo a lengthy and sometimes humiliating process to be removed from the military register. The issues facing queer people are radically different around the world, and many in The Alliance, myself included, thought “ I knew that this was happening. But I didn’t know the gravity, and how I could support people.” The hope is that folks will take this awareness back to their organizations and communities and be advocates when they can. Participants got to meet LGBTQ+ refugees, people who resettled in Athens to escape persecution at home. What was that like? Alliance members, McKinsey colleagues, and queer refugees all had lunch together—it was great. The refugees asked questions about our careers and how we got to where we are, and we gained insight into their lives and experience. It reminded us why it’s so important to keep working, creating opportunities, and breaking down barriers. The LGBTQ+ community is extremely diverse. How did you think about a program that would bring everyone together? We doubled down on our commitment to bring visibility to a variety of critical, top of mind issues. In addition to focusing on high-risk geographies, we also talked about transgender and non-binary inclusion in the workplace and intersectional identities. While there were of course differences in experience, there was much commonality. Participants shared stories of coming out, of having to hide their queerness, and of being at an intersection that negatively impacted their career advancement. And people were very open, honest, and willing to share. It was a beautiful thing. Finally, what did you see as the biggest impact to come out of the meeting this year? There were many great takeaways, but the sense people that people don’t have to go it alone was the most impactful. There are partners around the world for them to work with, commiserate with, celebrate with. Attendees engaged with nearly 100 senior peers from multiple sectors, all committed to LGBTQ+ inclusion and the path to equity for our community. After the pandemic’s isolation, that was worth everything. related A McKinsey LGBTQ+ leader who’s helping to build a global alliance Never miss a story"

Photo credits: Petri Anttila, Slush 2022 December 7, 2022 It takes a lot of sisu —Finnish for perseverance—to get through Helsinki’s dark, slushy winter.  Perseverance or ‘getting through the slush’ is also a trait that every new company needs—so in 2008, when it came to naming a Helsinki event dedicated to startups, Slush fit the bill. This year, Slush drew 12,000 people, making it one of the largest conventions for startups in the world, with two packed days of matchmaking, pitching, launching, mentoring, and showcasing. Our colleagues from Fuel, a McKinsey Company specializing in startups, and Leap by McKinsey , which helps incumbents build new businesses, welcomed entrepreneurs, investors, clients, and prospects to our event space to connect and consider new insights on the best practices for startup growth. For the new report, Hard choices: How Europe’s fastest growing startups become unicorns , McKinsey surveyed approximately 100 scale-stage European startups to identify key strategies that accelerate growth. These include decisions such as prioritizing product growth over geographic expansion and acquiring companies for their talent, products, and IP rather than market presence. Aspects of all of these practices were on full display at the event, according to our attendees. The emerging startup environment in the Nordics and Baltics is vibrant and offers enormous potential, according to Kari Kulojärvi , the managing partner of our Finland office. He attributes this to several factors. “The universities encourage innovation and are developing an initial ecosystem where like-minded people can collaborate,” he says. “They are teaching their students how to set up their own companies, make connections, and test their products in market.” Kari also points to Finland’s unique heritage in technology, whose roots can be traced to iconic companies such as Nokia. “The same specialists who ten years ago were developing smartphones and mobile phones and have deep expertise in imaging, signal processing, and photonics today are using that knowledge to build their own new technologies and companies,” he says. Resilience was top-of-mind throughout the week, as startups face rising interest rates, falling public tech valuations, tightening consumer spend, and other headwinds. “Funding is tighter despite ample capital. There is a lot of ‘dry powder’ available, but the bar to invest is rising,” says Tobias Lundgren, a partner in McKinsey’s office in Stockholm . “Companies should focus on prudent, profitable growth. And sustainability grows alongside technology.” Sid Ramtri , a McKinsey associate partner who attended Slush, said that “investors were seeing a lot of energy and ideas that will be shaping our future, especially around sustainability and health.” He cited several examples: 100 percent renewable and sustainable data centers, electric motorcycles, AI-based imaging to identify cancer, and even edible packing material, designed to help counter the environmental impact of shipping goods. McKinsey has established a strong track record of impact supporting both startups and investors. For example, through Leap by McKinsey, we have helped 350+ companies assemble new businesses; and our Fuel practitioners have worked with 450+ startups to scale through the different phases of growth, from initial strategy setting, through pricing, go-to-market roadmaps, and funding platforms. “With our global expertise, we can provide insights on any functional or industry topic in the most accessible way,” says Sid. “If you have a Brazilian startup in retail that wants to expand into Egypt, for example, we can work with them on every detail. If that same startup then wants to explore opportunities in Indonesia, we can help with that as well.” According to Kari, working alongside these new businesses as they advance from one stage to the next is a big part of what sets McKinsey apart in the space. “It shows startups that we are actually partners with them,” says Kari. “They appreciate the chance to develop lasting relationships as opposed to just doing transactional work.” related Fifteen unicorns founded by McKinsey alums may be shaping your world Never miss a story"
McKinsey helps co-found global movement promoting employee wellbeing and health,"McKinsey Health Institute is a founding member of the World Wellbeing Movement, which brings business and other leaders together to revolutionize employee wellbeing.",2022-12-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-helps-co-found-global-movement-promoting-employee-wellbeing-and-health,"McKinsey helps co-found global movement promoting employee wellbeing and health Representatives of founding members of the World Wellbeing Movement at the launch event. December 12, 2022 Nap rooms, meditation apps, and healthy snacks are some of the perks companies are increasingly offering to foster employee wellbeing. But these measures alone only treat symptoms—they won’t move the needle on employee burnout and mental health. “If core factors in the workplace are not right, you can’t yoga your way to creating employee health,” says Martin Dewhurst , a senior partner and co-leader of the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), a non-profit-generating entity within the firm whose mission is to improve quality of life, including employee mental health and wellbeing . MHI is a founding member of the new World Wellbeing Movement , along with Unilever, Snam, indeed, S&P, HSBC, University of Oxford and many others , uniting business, academia and governments. “Wellbeing, more broadly, is about how we feel our lives are going—and both physical and mental health are important drivers of this,” says Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, co-founder of the World Wellbeing Movement and director of the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. “We know that the science of wellbeing can shape business and policy. That’s where wellbeing belongs—at the heart of decision-making.” The movement has been in the works since before the pandemic, but the challenges presented by COVID-19 accelerated the momentum, leading to a July launch event . “To see this finally taking off with so many partnerships—corporations representing half a million people, government leaders—it gave the feeling that the tide could turn,” Martin says. A recent MHI global survey on how people define their health found that respondents viewed health through four dimensions—physical, mental, social, and spiritual—a wider definition than many systems and companies use. Employers neglect these at their own peril because they can contribute to rising rates of employee burnout . To help employers better understand burnout causes and identify remedies MHI surveyed 15,000 employees and 1,000 HR decision makers in 15 countries. It found that toxic workplace culture is by far the biggest driver of burnout. Individual efforts at health only go so far if employees must accept bullying from colleagues or customers, lack work-life balance, or have their work undermined. Employees in toxic cultures are eight times more likely to report symptoms of burnout; those experiencing burnout were six times more likely to say there were soon planning to leave their jobs. “Throughout my career of over 25 years, and from actively listening to employees across many sectors, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly of corporate culture,” explains Sarah Cunningham, managing director of the World Wellbeing Movement. “Creating workplace cultures with employee wellbeing firmly at the core must be a top priority for every employer.” Even with the best of intentions, it can be a challenge for employers to know how to operationalize, track and quantify wellbeing. “Every company is dealing with this, but by themselves,” says Jan-Emmanuel. “They don't have the time or the resources to dig into all the academic evidence on which interventions work.” In addition, CHROs or other staff looking to champion wellbeing struggle to make a case for investment. “Typically, a CFO will say, ‘I want to know what the return on investment is,’ and unfortunately, it's been a mystery black box,” adds Sarah. In response, much of the movement’s work centers on standardizing measurements and metrics, such as questions to ask employees in pulse surveys that establish a common baseline. It also makes research accessible on initiatives such as shorter work weeks, peer-recognition programs, providing space for gratitude and an array of managerial approaches. The movement’s vision is to better connect high-end academic research with the live demands of organizations and policymakers and translate these into real-world impact. “We have the tools to make a wide-scale difference on wellbeing, we just need to grow the movement to make it happen,” says Jan-Emmanuel. We have the tools to make a wide-scale difference on wellbeing, we just need to grow the movement to make it happen. MHI advances this mission by fostering a strong network of employers dedicated to the aspiration of improving health—providing data, insights, and tools for employers to drive change at scale. And on a daily basis, McKinsey itself strives to live the values of the World Wellbeing Movement by investing in employees’ mental health and wellbeing. This reflects McKinsey’s Way We Work function, which fosters individual and team wellbeing through people and tools that support colleagues. McKinsey also offers Mind Matters, a firmwide program offering early intervention, resources, and awareness of mental health and substance-use disorders. “We’ve learned that mental health and wellbeing must be at the very heart of how we have impact as an organization. It cannot be an add on,” says Michael Edwards , McKinsey’s global leader of Way We Work and director of people and operations in the UK, Ireland and Israel. “We’ve fostered a team environment of support. We’re all in this together.” Never miss a story"
McKinsey report on New Jersey&rsquo;s pandemic recovery offers lessons in driving inclusive growth,"Five years after publishing seminal research on economic development in the state, we continue that conversation in a newly published report, The Garden State in bloom: Cultivating New Jersey&rsquo;s workforce of tomorrow.",2022-12-13T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/what%20new%20jerseys%20pandemic%20recovery%20can%20teach%20leaders/nj-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-report-on-new-jerseys-pandemic-recovery-offers-lessons-in-driving-inclusive-growth,"McKinsey report on New Jersey’s pandemic recovery offers lessons in driving inclusive growth December 13, 2022 Five years after McKinsey published Reseeding growth in the Garden State , seminal research on economic development in the state, we continue that conversation in a newly published report, The Garden State in bloom: Cultivating New Jersey’s workforce of tomorrow . Even as total employment in New Jersey has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the state—like many others across the US—faces a talent shortage in selected occupations, among other challenges. Here, some of the report’s authors share what inspired them to take a new look at the state’s economic potential and why a comprehensive talent strategy could bring opportunities for all of its residents. Why did you want to take a new look at economic development in New Jersey in this moment? Aaron De Smet : New Jersey is interesting in that it’s a fairly high income, urban, and suburban place, with most of our larger cities also serving as suburbs of Philadelphia and New York. The state has a lot of highly skilled, highly educated, and highly paid workers, and New Jersey has some of the best universities. We should be attracting more talent and keeping a greater portion of the talent who grow up here. All of this made New Jersey an interesting place to look at when it comes to opportunities for employers, employees, and communities. And how do these opportunities change as we look ahead to disruptions in the workplace, from technology and automation to increased remote work? We’re at an inflection point where a lot of things are changing in how we think about what work is and what it means to be an employer or an employee. Now felt like a good time to ask: What do those changes mean for a unique place like New Jersey, and how can we take advantage of them? Zachary Surak : There are many folks in our office who were born and raised in New Jersey—Jocelyn and I count ourselves among them—and also so many transplants who take pride in helping change and make an impact in the community. Five years ago we did some work on economic development in New Jersey called Reseeding growth in the Garden State , which examined changing the trajectory of the economic performance of the state. We think of this latest research as an extension of that dialogue—chapter two of that work. What are some examples of the practical implications of our research? Aaron: I’ll give you an example. There is currently a national shortage of truck drivers who have a commercial driver’s license. We know that one of the best ways to get truck drivers—as is often the case in any profession—is to get them pretty young and not require they attend a college, but instead a vocational school right out of high school. The problem is: The only way to make money as a truck driver is to be able to drive cross state lines, and you can't do that until you’re at a certain age. But now, with a shortage of long haul truck drivers, there’s a pilot program that the federal government has launched to help address this, by reaching 18, 19, and 20-year olds who in the past would not have been eligible. New Jersey is a great place for this kind of innovation because it’s already a transportation hub. New Jersey is already doing some of these things, but if you read our report, you might ask: Why wouldn’t New Jersey double down on this with more public-private partnerships to better upskill young kids? That’s exactly the kind of thing we should be doing more of and investing in. I don’t want to overplay this—it’s just one small micro example of a creative way to make a difference. If we do enough of these things systematically—across lots of different opportunities, lots of different professions, lots of different types of partnerships—in aggregate, they can make a huge impact on the state. The Garden State in bloom What kind of collaboration is required to realize impact? Zachary: There’s two tracks here. One track is collective action—for example, higher education institutions partnering with the private sector to design and accredit reskilling programs in the region, and then deploy those reskilled workers to areas where employers need talent. That coordination of matching supply and demand is a massive opportunity. The second track is individual institutions. There are many actions that individual institutions can take to both get smart on their exposure to the economic and workforce challenges ahead so that they’re not blindsided by this over the coming decade. Jocelyn Grahame : For collaboration to happen, a few things need to be true. The problem really needs to be universal—and affect the institutions who are being asked to collaborate equally, which I think is definitely true in this instance. If everyone goes out and tries to solve the talent shortage on their own, you end up with a situation where everyone is competing for a shrinking pool of talent, but the needs are not shrinking. You’ve got to have leaders who are willing to think more broadly than their individual institution. And I think it also has to be based on personal trust, which we saw during the pandemic. Because there was a greater good, because leaders were willing to trust each other and work together, we saw better answers the more they collaborated. What’s one thing you hope readers take away from the report? Jocelyn: The future of work is obviously a topic for everybody, and when you look at the specific factors affecting New Jersey, we saw a lot of movement, including people from urban areas into more suburban and rural areas, as well as people leaving the state. We see a lot of questions that affect not only organizational stakeholders in the state, but also individual actors in the state, such as healthcare organizations, who are doing profoundly important work. But six of the top 10 professions for which we have the biggest talent gaps are actually all in healthcare. We also know the workforce isn’t monolithic. So how do leaders think about the talent that’s going to help them reach their goals over the longer term, not just the shorter term? The last few years, lots of companies have been competing intensely for talent, which might have higher flight risk because of the remote environment. So the question is: How do we tap into some of those hidden talent pools? Zachary: If you look back at the pandemic recovery—and even if you look over a longer time period of the last 20 years—certain populations have been left behind. So there’s an existential question here for the region: How do we create more opportunities for more diverse populations who have tons of capacity to contribute in different ways? And how do we unlock that capacity? I think if people had the fact base, they would be surprised by the kind of economic dynamics that are present, and all the opportunity that could be unleashed to create inclusive growth in the workforce with a little collective action. related JobsOhio and the long-term, innovative revitalization of a state’s economy Never miss a story"

Over four days in Singapore last month, business executives, policy makers, scientists and other leaders were joined by our colleagues to address topics including health, the climate, trade, finance, inflation, and the future. Read on for edited highlights from our delegates’ takeaways or head to our Future of Asia page to watch them all. Tracy Francis on growth, tech, and the road to net-zero We know that organizations that, throughout downturns, are able to both manage resilience and growth emerge significantly stronger than their competitors. So, thinking about, ""What are the avenues for growth at this time? ” is really important. We are at a moment where tech is obviously critical to everything. There ’ s talent that ’ s more available than ever before. And so, particularly for incumbents, there ’ s a moment to really double, triple down on the elements of tech. It has become absolutely clear that net-zero also needs to come in a way that is providing energy that is both affordable and accessible to folks. For companies to think through, ""What is their path to net-zero, and are there a series of actions that can be taken now that are actually relatively lower CapEx and relatively easier but get them some way along the journey? ” is a really important reflection. Watch: Navigating volatility: Six trends businesses should look out for Gautam Kumra on resilience The most important imperative is to build resilience. And when I say resilience, I mean both institutional resilience and individual resilience. Institutional resilience means the ability to play both defense and offense. By defense, I mean the “no regret” moves like cost optimization, restructuring, realigning your supply chains, or embedding data and technology into everything you do. When I say offense, I mean mergers and acquisitions, building new businesses, and entering new geographies and product lines. Every leader must think about both defense and offense to build institutional resilience. When I talk about individual resilience, I mean maintaining your energy—your mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional energy. I mean really leading with a sense of purpose not just for yourself, but also to give your employees and people a sense of purpose because we are also facing a war for talent. Watch: How companies can build institutional and individual resilience Dymfke Kuijpers on being a business “triathlete” In today ’ s world you need to be triathlete. You need to have three mindsets: one of growth, one of frugality, and one of learning. You need to find the growth and go for it. But at the same time, you must take out cost where it doesn ’ t add any value to reinvest it back into innovation and growth. Then there is learning. We ’ re living in times that are so uncertain unless you have a very open mindset. As a CEO and as a leader, understand that you don ’ t know what you don't know. You can react fast but also use data to be more ahead of competition so you ’ re not only fast, but you ’ re faster than competition. Consumers see zero boundaries between the physical and online. As a consumer company, where are you in that ecosystem? Where am I building brands, where am I selling, and how do I play in that zero-boundaries world? Watch: How consumer companies can embrace change amid volatility Global flows Jeongmin Seong on an interconnected world One of the big questions that business leaders have these days is whether we are heading towards a deglobalized world. Our research highlights that we still remain in a deeply connected world, but the fabric of that connection is changing towards more intangibles and knowledge-driven flows. With this in mind, leaders can explore a couple different actions. One opportunity is to enhance resiliency for your business. We identified the risk associated with concentration. We analyzed about 6,000 globally traded products and found out that about 20 percent of the products in terms of quantity, and 10 percent in terms of value, are highly concentrated. This means fewer than three countries account for almost all global exports. So, how do you manage this concentration through diversification or substitution? Sometimes, building a long-term relationship with your core suppliers will be very critical. Watch: Capturing opportunities in an interconnected world Oliver Tonby on where businesses should invest right now I think business leaders now need to get sharper views. What do I mean? It ’ s very important that companies are robust in face of the uncertainty that ’ s coming. So as a CEO, as the top team, you want to know the capital that your company is going to require in the next three, 12, 24 months. You want to know what portfolio projects you have already committed to, the ones that have potential, next generation, and so on. We know that there are going to be trillions of dollars required because of the energy transitions that are happening, driven by climate change and the sustainability revolution. We know that there ’ s a ton of opportunity coming from next-generation technology and digital analytics. So, be ready to invest behind those. But let ’ s also be clear, know where to invest in the value chain. What are the choke points in that value chain? That ’ s where you want to be investing behind. Watch: Placing a premium on resilience: How businesses can thrive through volatility Joydeep Sengupta on banks navigating disruption I think banks have seen tailwinds coming through from high-interest rates and high margins, and costs have generally been under control. The risk environment has been the lowest that banks have experienced. It ’ s been a fantastic run for banks around the world. In some ways, the opportunity that banks have had in the last 12, 18 months should give them the breathing room to adjust to some of these changes. I would say don ’ t miss the oxygen that exists. Take advantage of the oxygen to invest in building a franchise which will be more stable and sustainable in the future. So, invest in new technologies. Invest in new talent. Invest in the digital transformation of your business. Make sure you are raising enough capital to secure yourself in bad times. And over and above this, make sure that your purpose and your focus remains resolute.

McKinsey survey uncovers surprises and opportunities in the inflation economy,"Inflation isn&rsquo;t letting up anytime soon. In this new landscape, we unpack what consumers face and how companies can better serve them and plan for growth.",2022-12-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/surprises%20and%20opportunities%20in%20the%20inflation%20economy/consumerpulse-hero-small-1403065158-1536x864.jpg,"Growth, Marketing & Sales",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/surprises-and-opportunities-in-the-inflation-economy,"McKinsey survey uncovers surprises and opportunities in the inflation economy December 16, 2022 Against a turbulent economic backdrop, McKinsey’s latest Consumer Pulse Survey shows an array of shifts in consumer sentiment and behavior that present challenges for employers. Twice as many US consumers are pessimistic about the economy now compared to the start of the pandemic and cash savings in low-income households are starting to run out. In Europe , consumer pessimism was at 22 percent in May of 2020. Now, it’s at 43 percent. On both continents, consumers are trading down and reducing or delaying discretionary purchases. But these times also hold significant opportunities for employers, particularly during the holiday season, where middle- and high-income consumers plan to spend big, despite holding on to savings recently. We spoke to three McKinsey Growth Marketing & Sales leaders to better understand how these shifts are impacting companies and break down how to respond to these disruptions and prepare for the future. Kelsey Robinson : Get closer to your consumer Our survey shows for 66 percent of survey respondents, inflation is a top issue of concern, especially higher prices on necessities like gas and food. But it’s important to understand how inflation and other forces impacting the economy are playing out across generations, and how these may affect sentiment and buying decisions. For instance, boomers were the most concerned about the economy, even though they have the most savings to support them in times like this. Conversely, Gen Z is least likely to name the economy as their top concern, focusing instead on social and environmental issues—even though they have the least in savings. Ultimately, these sentiments still translate to consumption patterns in both groups dictated by their balance sheets: despite high concern, Boomers are taking few cost-cutting measures, while Gen Z is more aggressive in cutting costs despite being less concerned. As companies work across the busy shopping season, they should balance short-term holiday promotions with the long-term health of their brands. This requires understanding details of consumer acquisition during the holidays, and then following up with customer-relationship-management tactics to boost retention. Tamara Charm : Know what matters to consumers These times call for a nuanced understanding of how consumers are feeling and reacting given an increasing number of external shocks. Gen Z and Millennials, for example, are looking for authenticity in the brands they buy and want to put their dollars behind responsible actors. They’re not just evaluating a product’s impact on their wallet but its broader effect on society. At the same time, 80 percent of them are trading down to lower priced products. So right now, that authenticity will not always command a premium. Companies need to manage value perception now more than ever across every category. In multiple categories with low inflation, such as electronics or cosmetics which have less inflation than the standard 2 percent increase, around 30 percent of survey respondents told us prices have risen significantly. The need to reassure consumers is paramount so they know they’re making smart purchases. Clear, personalized messages like ""here's something we think you'll like” delivered when and where consumer want to buy at the right price will be powerful for consumers. Brian Gregg: How to capture this moment These turbulent times are a defining moment for leaders to deliver profitable and sustainable growth by acutely focusing on these five breakout moves to emerge even stronger, while operating at multiple speeds. Focus on inflation-proof growth. Preserving demand requires data-driven pricing strategy to effectively protect margins, preserve demand, and manage promotions to drive value. This can be done at different speeds, depending on the company’s needs: a one-time increase, incremental increases, or by building a tech-enabled, analytic-driven model that constantly shifts pricing to match inflation. Self-funded growth through efficiency. Making sure your house is in order is crucial during chaotic times. In our experience, companies can use this moment to capture bottom-line savings of 10 to 35 percent that can be reinvested in other high-growth areas. The first step is identifying opportunities to reduce costs by examining category efficiency—across marketing, media, and commercial spend to capture cost savings. This way, companies can re-allocate and drive the highest incremental growth. Personalize customer engagements. Companies that link data with what their customers care about can deliver personalized customer journeys—from higher customer acquisitions, value, and retention—including 10 to 20 percent in revenue uplift, and 20 to 30 percent reductions in cost to serve. This requires having a detailed view of which customer journeys and touchpoints drive the most value and mapping the path to capture value, including the right starting point, key milestones, and how impact is measured. Going all in on omnichannel sales. B2B buyers and consumers want an always-on, personalized omnichannel experience. That’s why it’s no surprise hybrid selling is expected to be the most dominant sales strategy by 2024. To deliver on sales growth and reduce cost requires bolstering omnichannel capabilities, scaling by using hybrid models to sell to and serve customers across channels. Plan for the future. This inflation cycle will end. Leaders can make this an opportunity to reimagine the operating model of the future—to be able to mobilize at a faster rate—and move at multiple speeds. Keep investing in businesses and betting on new products and revenue streams. related McKinsey acquires S4G Consulting to help businesses ignite growth Never miss a story"
"To build a decarbonized future, McKinsey summit unites infrastructure leaders&nbsp;","The eighth Global Infrastructure Initiative Summit took place in Tokyo and focused on creating the pathway to sustainable, resilient, and inclusive infrastructure.",2022-12-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20builds%20sustainable%20infrastructure%20community%20at%20gii%20summit/mckinsey-builds-sustainable-infrastructure-community-at-gii-summit.jpg,"Sustainability,Engineering, Construction, & Building Materials",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-builds-sustainable-infrastructure-community-at-gii-summit,"To build a decarbonized future, McKinsey summit unites infrastructure leaders McKinsey partner Swarna Ramanathan (far left) moderated a panel on building cyber resilience. December 19, 2022 McKinsey held its Global Infrastructure Initiative Summit in Tokyo this year, where leaders gathered to discuss and craft critical actions to create the pathway to sustainable infrastructure. Held over three days, the event drew 200 senior leaders from 128 organizations across investing, construction, energy, transportation, and real estate. To some, this year’s event felt like a reunion. Many leaders return year after year to the Global Infrastructure Initiative Summit as a forum for knowledge and peer connectivity. “After two years of gathering virtually, it’s been tremendously energizing to see our community back in-person again,” said Shannon Peloquin , McKinsey partner and Global Infrastructure Initiative 2022 co-chair. For the last ten years, McKinsey's Global Infrastructure Initiative has sought to create trust-based forums for senior decision-makers to scale innovation, forge relationships, and mobilize change in pursuit of sustainable, resilient, inclusive infrastructure. McKinsey serves as the convenor of the community, with the aspiration of creating shared momentum toward smarter, greener infrastructure. The summit, now in its eighth iteration, has long focused on improving the delivery of essential infrastructure. Today, the Global Infrastructure Initiative is sharply focused on the role of infrastructure in global decarbonization, and the summit agenda strongly represented this shift. The movement toward net-zero is a massive global undertaking, and infrastructure is at the heart of the transition – reaching net-zero will require spending of $9.2 trillion a year on physical assets every year to 2050, with 75 percent of this in mobility, power, and buildings. As such, a decarbonized future must include industry-wide and industry-led changes in the way that infrastructure is conceived. Last week, GII published the summit’s key ideas and themes in a new report, Sustainable infrastructure: The best ideas from the 2022 GII Summit . The report details the findings of the summit, including highlights from each of the summit’s sector-specific roundtables. It dives into the necessity of industry-wide cooperation in order to hit net-zero targets. Among other ideas, the summit again highlighted that the all-encompassing nature of the industry gives it an opportunity to harness the power of collaboration to ensure sustainable and resilient infrastructure. “We really need to keep our efforts targeted toward net-zero and not underestimate the ability that infrastructure has to be transformative,” said summit attendee Marie Lam-Frendo , CEO of the Global Infrastructure Hub, a G20 initiative that works to advance sustainable and resilient infrastructure. The pathway to sustainable infrastructure is neither straight nor short. Its successful navigation to reach net-zero emissions is the unrivaled business challenge of a generation of leaders. Bringing them together, this event makes clear, is key to meeting it. “It’s really inspiring to see what happens in this industry globally,” said summit attendee Emiel Roozen , executive board member of TBI Holdings. “This network is so interesting and we can learn so much from each other in this highly fragmented market.” Never miss a story"

Summers. January 13, 2023 The Museum of the City of New York chronicles the vast history of struggles, victories, and opportunities that have made the city what it is. Now, as it confronts a post-pandemic future, the city again arrives at a historic crossroads. To meet this moment, McKinsey recently held the Future of New York Summit at the museum. The city is home to McKinsey’s largest office, with over 3,000 colleagues. It’s also one of our oldest; the office celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2022. Business, nonprofit, and government leaders gathered to hear our latest research on catalyzing inclusive economic growth. Speakers from the mayor’s office, restaurateur Danny Meyer, actor and director Lin-Manuel Miranda, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, and other luminaries informed and inspired attendees, calling on them to take action to address the needs of the city identified in a new McKinsey report, New York Metro Area workforce: Challenges and opportunities for growth . It looks at factors that are keeping residents out of the labor force and impeding workers from coming to the city—and what leaders can do to build a stronger future for every New Yorker. Sheena Wright, First Deputy Mayor to Mayor Eric Adams, urged the crowd not to simply recover from the pandemic, but to achieve a city never seen before. “My charge to you, as shared caretakers of the future of this city, we can reimagine and create what it could and should be,” she said. “If we center the lived experiences of our people in all we do, we will realize our vision.” The report chronicles how the strength of the city has long been its people. The region has the highest GDP per worker of any city in the nation. It has the most people holding bachelor’s and advanced professional degrees, and the largest share of immigrants participating in the labor force relative to population. Yet there are significant challenges—brewing even before the pandemic—that are holding the city’s economy back. According to our research, the educational attainment of unemployed New Yorkers does not match the needs of employers: 51 percent want to hire those with a 
bachelor’s degree or higher when only 33 percent have such degrees. This mismatch contributes to New York having the lowest labor force participation rate among other major US cities. Furthermore, automation will hit workers without bachelor’s degrees hardest. In the top seven occupations projected to be impacted by automation, 47 percent of workers are Black or Hispanic. Lawrence H. Summers stressed that early investment in the city’s youth is key to solving these issues. “Long-term business success depends on the success of our urban public schools and achieving close to universal inclusion,” he said. Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Economic & Workforce Development, discussed how challenges in affordable housing constrain the city’s economic development. McKinsey’s research shows that over the last decade, median rent has risen 29 percent, but wages have risen only 23 percent; employment has risen 12 percent, but housing stock only 4 percent. “New York City is the purest distillation of the promise of this country, but a decent and safe home is out of reach,” she said. Our research found that international migration to the city has decreased 37 percent in the last decade, and domestic migration by 16 percent. While many speakers referred to these challenges as sobering, there was also much excitement over progress made and opportunities ahead. Danny Meyer discussed the many long-term changes to the restaurant industry brought about by the extreme disruption of the pandemic, such as reforming wage practices to increase racial equity and increasing revenue through outdoor dinning. “We accelerated our diversity goals by five years because of the pandemic,” said Danny. “The shutdown was devastating, but we were able to take the boat out of the water and inspect the barnacles. When else would we have had the opportunity?” Lin-Manuel Miranda, in a fireside chat with CBS News’ Gayle King, discussed how his family immigrated to New York City from Puerto Rico. He told the crowd he wrote “Wait for it,” an iconic song from his show Hamilton, while riding the subway, and that the city must always be a place that welcomes immigrants and offers opportunities like he’s had. A core belief at McKinsey is that economies are stronger when growth opportunities are created for everyone—this served as our inspiration for the Future of New York Summit. Our hope for the summit was that it could serve as a catalyst for change. “What’s inspiring about the subway is you see the unique diversity of our city, the McKinsey person next to the Mariachi band,” he said. “And you can feel how both of them, everyone, make every other city feel like summer camp.” Yael Taqqu , managing partner for McKinsey’s New York Office, who hosted the evening, commented: “A core belief at McKinsey is that economies are stronger when growth opportunities are created for everyone—this served as our inspiration for the Future of New York Summit. Our hope for the summit was that it could serve as a catalyst for change. I believe that as a group, the institutions and people that attended have all we need to solve these problems.” Never miss a story"
New McKinsey survey reveals the AI tech-talent landscape,Our new survey offers a look at how AI is shaping the tech-talent landscape and highlights the need for progress in managing risk and strengthening inclusion.,2023-01-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/ai%20reinvents%20tech%20talent%20opportunities/ai-tech-talent-hero-1073867734-1536x864.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/ai-reinvents-tech-talent-opportunities,"New McKinsey survey reveals the AI tech-talent landscape January 20, 2023 After five years of steady, sometimes heady, growth, AI adoption has plateaued, according to The state of AI in 2022 , our annual survey of 1,500 companies. Use cases are stable, and the market for tech talent is tight, with new “hot jobs” surfacing every year. But much remains to be done about managing risk and building inclusive teams. “After a period of initial exuberance, we have reached a plateau, a course we’ve observed with other technologies in their early years of adoption,” says partner Michael Chui . He authored the research with senior partners and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey leaders Alex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky ; partner Helen Mayhew ; and associate partner Bryce Hall . “We might be seeing the reality sinking in about the level of organizational change it takes to successfully embed this technology,” Michael adds. In 2017, 20 percent of respondents reported adopting AI in at least one business area. After peaking at 58 percent in 2019, it’s dropped to 50 percent today. The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in review This tailing off is not about saturation; most organizations haven’t yet maximized the opportunity of the technology, according to our research. It’s that companies aren’t investing in the resources needed for the organizational change required to effectively implement AI. One reason is that there’s a talent crunch. A typical AI project requires a highly-skilled team including a data scientist, data engineer, machine-learning engineer, product manager, and designer—and there simply aren’t enough skilled professionals available, even with the recent contraction across the technology industry. Companies are increasingly hiring directly from bootcamps and training academies, regional tech companies, and professional organizations, according to the research. “As employers,” says Helen Mayhew, “we have to think creatively about how we find talent and develop a meaningful apprenticeship journey to help them develop skills as role requirements change, which can be as frequently as every six months.” That’s exactly what Smaranda Gosa-Mensing does at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey , where she leads the people team, designs career paths for our tech professionals, and works closely with leaders to build an environment to help AI talent to flourish. “We've talked to a lot of HR leaders in the tech industry to understand what really motivates this talent. Understandably, people want to have a sense of belonging,” Smaranda says. Our guilds—organized by expertise including data engineering, data science, and software engineering—play an important role in providing AI practitioners with an engaged community, best practices, and skills development. McKinsey offers tech talent opportunities to work on real and challenging problems for clients such as decarbonization, business building, and AI implementations—in an environment that encourages innovation. “Our senior experts gain leadership experience and a chance to shape the future landscape of technology,” Smaranda points out. According to our research, the AI space is evolving quickly with a greater specialization in roles. One example is the machine learning engineer who designs, builds, and productionizes predictive models and AI systems for automation, performance, and scalability. Our senior experts gain a seat at the leadership table and a chance to shape the future landscape of technology. “When it comes to sourcing AI talent, the most popular strategy among all respondents is reskilling existing employees. Nearly half of the companies we surveyed are doing so,” says Alexander Sukharevsky . According to him, we invest in up to 200 hours of learning per year per technologist and have apprenticeships that blend on-the-job learning of business skills with tech-training programs. As they progress to more senior levels, McKinsey technologists often specialize in an industry or function. The new report shines a light on the industry's challenges with diversity. Addressing them will be a critical factor to long-term success. “With the scarcity of talent, needless to say, the research findings on diversity are concerning,” observes Helen.  The average share of employees on AI teams at respondents’ organizations who identify as women is just 27 percent; the share is similar among the average proportion of racial or ethnic minorities: 25 percent. Diverse and inclusive perspectives are especially critical in AI to prevent issues of bias in datasets and models, and distrust in outcomes. Looking ahead, as companies evolve their strategies for developing AI tech talent, they may find lessons that are applicable to other parts of their business; the newest wave of generative AI models , for example, promises to reinvent functions such as communications, sales, and human resources. “As individual AI capabilities, such as natural-language processing and generation, continue to improve and democratize,” says Bryce Hall in the report, “we’re excited to see a wave of new applications emerge and more companies capture value from AI at scale.” related Three experts offer an inside look at the state of AI Can data science turn ocean conservation dreams into reality?

With the addition of Iguazio’s technology and a team of more than 70 data and AI experts, McKinsey will be able to dramatically accelerate and scale AI deployments, driving further impact for clients. The pace of change has never been faster. To thrive in today’s competitive market, harnessing the power of AI is essential. According to McKinsey research, more than $490 billion was invested in AI by organizations around the globe from 2012 to 2021. But most business leaders are still struggling to translate these investments into concrete returns, with only 10 percent of AI projects actually emerging from the lab and succeeding in real business environments. As a leader in the technology space, QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey has been working with clients for more than a decade to embed AI into real-time decision making to help solve the world’s most challenging problems. But one key question remained unanswered: how do organizations successfully deploy and scale AI to unlock real business value? “The answer to this is multi-dimensional. It requires getting many elements right simultaneously – data, algorithms, IT architecture, capabilities, change management, and domain expertise,” explains Alexander Sukharevsky , McKinsey senior partner and global co-leader QuantumBlack. “We have been working on a holistic offering that allows us to master all these dimensions in a very intuitive way, and we have road-tested it with various clients across the globe. Our teams have been working on a solution that automates and accelerates AI development, deployment, putting AI applications into production at scale and in real-time in any environment.” Working with Iguazio, QuantumBlack will be able to immediately provide clients with industry-specific AI solutions that are five times more productive, eight times faster from proof-of-concept to production, and twice as reliable. “We analyzed more than a 1000 AI companies worldwide and identified Iguazio as the best fit to significantly accelerate our AI offering – from the initial concept to production, in a simplified, scalable and automated manner,” says Ben Ellencweig , McKinsey senior partner and QuantumBlack global leader of alliances and acquisitions. “Iguazio has a state-of-the-art technology that has generated significant market traction with some of our marquee clients and earned them top-industry recognition. Strengthening our offering with Iguazio will allow us to present to the market the first holistic solution globally that helps any organization truly harness the full potential of AI.” Creating value beyond the hype Over time, the Iguazio and QuantumBlack teams will be fully integrated, working from a single product roadmap, to bring together the best technology assets of each firm into a single product. Our new offering will allow us to integrate AI in real-time decision making and capture full value to help clients drive sustainable and inclusive growth. Inside our new offering “This acquisition will enable us to implement AI with fewer resources at significantly lower cost,” says Alex Singla , McKinsey senior partner and QuantumBlack global co-leader. “This is especially meaningful for companies experiencing a critical shortage of tech talent, one of the reasons many AI projects have been delayed.” This is McKinsey’s first acquisition in Israel. Our newly extended team will serve as the foundation for a new QuantumBlack location, which McKinsey expects to expand and grow in the coming years. “Attracting exceptional tech talent and expanding our tech ecosystem will enable us to welcome colleagues from around the globe to Tel Aviv’s exciting tech scene,” says Matt Fitzpatrick , McKinsey senior partner and QuantumBlack Labs global co-leader. Iguazio’s four co-founders – CEO Asaf Somekh , along with CTO Yaron Haviv , COO Yaron Segev, and VP Architecture Orit Nissan-Messing – have been working together since 2001, both in their own startups and across multiple organizations, and have developed some of the core technologies of enterprise analytics and AI. They have seen firsthand, and know how to overcome, the organizational challenges of using AI. “From a values perspective, we are always thinking first about ‘what are our clients’ needs, not just now but a year from today?’ And we have cultivated a production-first platform that is geared towards automation and acceleration of the data science process end-to-end, serving as a foundation for clients to scale their AI initiatives quickly and easily across the entire company,” says Asaf. “We’re thrilled to join the McKinsey family and help clients see real business value from their AI initiatives.” For Iguazio colleagues, joining McKinsey offers the chance to deliver greater value to more enterprise clients around the world. “We have spent years developing and refining our technology. This is an opportunity for wider adoption, better vertical solution integration, and, together with McKinsey’s team, making it simpler for enterprises to generate real business value from AI with far less overhead.” adds Orit. Last month, Forrester designated McKinsey a “leader” among AI service providers . “McKinsey’s acquisition of Iguazio and its transformative technology is a testament to the firm’s commitment to helping enterprises build their businesses around data and AI to drive greater efficiency and accelerate delivery of modern and innovative services to market,” says Yaron Haviv. “The next phase of AI innovation is among us,” says Alex Sukharevsky. “And we’re proud to be leading this journey.” related New McKinsey survey reveals the AI tech-talent landscape Never miss a story"

While the African soil is rich, with endowments capable of producing bounties, most farmers struggle economically, consumers spend too much on food, and malnutrition and stunting in children are widespread on the continent, according to UNICEF . “This does not need to be our reality,” says Omid Kassiri , managing partner in McKinsey’s Nairobi office. “With the right policies, infrastructure, support, and capabilities, we’ve seen that agriculture in Africa can be transformed and make a massive, meaningful difference in people’s lives.” Change is underway but will take a concerted, multi-stakeholder effort. To bring together public, private, and NGO partners in this work, the African Agricultural Transformation Initiative (AATI) was established. Hosted by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), an international financial institution and specialized United Nations agency dedicated to eradicating poverty and hunger in developing countries, AATI seeks to support African countries in developing and implementing agricultural transformations. McKinsey served as an integral member of the founding coalition. Co-founded by partners including the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , IFAD, and McKinsey, AATI builds on McKinsey’s impact on agriculture and food systems across Africa, including work to increase food production that resulted in 11 million fewer undernourished people, 150,000 fewer deaths from hunger, and one hundred thousand new jobs. McKinsey brought fact-based and practical support to several issues during these engagements: increasing farmers’ technical knowledge—what to grow, how to grow, what fertilizers to use, what practices and techniques to deploy; increasing their capacity to invest in irrigation methods, fertilizer and crop protection; research and development for crops optimized for the African climate; and creating linkages to markets to name a few. The results inspired McKinsey to find a way to build on this work, finding a path to help launch AATI through the Fund for Social Good , a pro bono program of multiyear firm support. “McKinsey is our vital thought leader for tools and methodologies that accelerate agricultural transformation,” says Safia Boly , executive director of AATI. “The role of McKinsey here is knowledge—of working with partners and having the reach to bring partners together, bringing digital solutions, delivery expertise, problem solving, and implementation methodologies, all of which has been essential to the establishment of the AATI.” AATI is launching its first wave of countries to accelerate effective and sustainable food systems changes based on their needs, priorities, and existing infrastructure. “When AATI identifies strategies for economic growth and innovation through agriculture, it is key that it be an opportunity for government and private sector,” says Safia. “There should always be a balance between the two because government will establish the environment for the private sector to flourish and drive the economic growth.” This perspective keeps inclusive growth at its center. We hope that AATI will grow to become a pillar of transformation across the continent. The goal is for it to be a constant driver for the transformation of the lives of millions and millions of people, country after country. “Our goal is to increase the percentage of small holder farmers who have become entrepreneurs. Because at the end of the day, we are trying to make agriculture a catalyst for economic growth,” says Safia. By supporting AATI, McKinsey is not just supporting agricultural and food systems transformations. It is creating an institution that will be an enduring catalyst for change in Africa. “We hope that AATI will grow to become a pillar of transformation across the continent,” says Omid. “The goal is for it to be a constant driver for the transformation of the lives of millions and millions of people, country after country.” related McKinsey and the ILO: Helping governments support small businesses in developing economies Never miss a story"

We’re grateful for their commitment and guidance.” The External Advisory Group, which will assemble this month for its first meeting this year, provides advice directly to our Shareholders Council, which oversees and directs the firm’s strategy and governance. Over the last several years, advice from the group has informed our approaches to building a more inclusive organization, measuring the impact of our work, accelerating sustainability, increasing our expertise and capabilities, and helping our clients navigate disruptions such as the global pandemic. Along with many of our clients, we’ve navigated numerous challenges over the past several years, thanks in part to good counsel from leaders who have helped broaden our perspective. “The advice this group of leaders has provided over the years has proved invaluable,” says McKinsey Digital co-leader Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner and Shareholders Council member who helped found the group. “Along with many of our clients, we’ve navigated numerous challenges over the past several years, thanks in part to good counsel from leaders who have helped broaden our perspective.” True resilience, the ability to thrive as disruptions continue, forms the foundation of sustainable and inclusive growth. We know that building it today requires balanced agendas and bold moves: launching new businesses; embracing new and better technology; accelerating the transition to net zero; and rethinking the future of the workplace for people around the world. related Bob Sternfels on global flows and value chains: “No region, no country is an island today.” Never miss a story"
New look at human development points way to inclusive growth,"The team behind Pixels of progress, our new MGI report, embraced a new approach to evaluating human progress that has uncovered surprising results.",2023-02-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20mgi%20research%20a%20microscopic%20view%20of%20human%20development%20reveals%20hidden%20vibrancy/pixels-hero-small-1151241337-1536x864.jpg,"McKinsey Global Institute,Inclusive Growth",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-mgi-research-a-microscopic-view-of-human-development-reveals-hidden-vibrancy,"New look at human development points way to inclusive growth February 15, 2023 Two years ago, a small team of McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) experts, launched a research project to analyze the state of human development around the world over the past 20 years. The team was led by MGI senior partners Chris Bradley , Sven Smit , and Jonathan Woetzel ; partner Tilman Tacke ; and Marc Canal , an MGI fellow. The team developed a new data set that broke the planet down into 40,000 microregions, a view 230 times more granular than a country perspective, which was how most data had previously been produced. For example, Germany was made up of 401 microregions, and Indonesia had 502. To calculate economic activity, they applied GDP statistics down to the smallest geographic area possible and then filled in the gaps using nighttime luminosity from satellite images as a measure of activity. The team gathered regularly to review the developing results.  “We fully expected to find that many communities had collapsed as manufacturing jobs were lost, young people left for university to never return, and public-health crises decimated many areas,” recalls Chris. “In fact, the project was initially named Left-behind places .” But the findings kept coming back positive—surprisingly so. The team stepped back and questioned what they were seeing, but they kept following the data. “We use the analogy of a microscope.  When scientists first looked at different specimens with their naked eye, they appeared still, dead. But once they were magnified, it was clear they were actually teeming with life,” explains Chris. “This is what we saw—whether we zoomed into the mountains of Italy, the jungles of Colombia, the outer reaches of Nigeria—there were pockets of vibrancy, growth and promise that were not visible at the country level. We changed the name of the report to Pixels of progress .” “One of my favorite findings was the amazing growth in life expectancy and importance of innovation,” says Marc. “In some places, people gained more than 20 years of life expectancy over 20 years of time. In most individual countries, regions that started lower in life expectancy actually grew faster than those at the top. Rendered graphically, the catch up is visualized as a massive convergence.” Innovations in healthcare, specifically new ways of making treatments and medicines low cost, accessible, and available quickly across the globe, have contributed to this trend. “This type of ‘catch-up innovation’ is just as significant as the initial scientific breakthrough,” points out Marc. “One example is the elimination or reduction of infectious diseases in Africa.” A twist to the research relates to China. Overall, two billion people achieved higher living standards. Half of them live in China alone—the second billion are spread across 75 other countries.  “It’s what we call ‘China times two,’” says Chris. “Without such a close up, localized view across so many countries, we would have missed it.” On the other side of the spectrum, our researchers saw a considerable reduction in the number of people living in microregions with the lowest living standards. “Twenty years ago, there were about 1.1 billion people with such standards of living, and that has actually dropped to 405 million today. In other words, we’re almost down to less than 5 percent of people living in the poorest parts in the world,” says Chris.  “This is not to say we don’t still have a long way to go, but it is tremendous progress.” Pixels of Progress: A granular look at human development around the world The report captures a snapshot of trends shaping the world today. There may never be more children than there are now, as birthrates in China and other countries drop. Japan and southern Italy have very high aging populations overall, hinting at the decline of areas where these populations are concentrated. There may never be more people living in rural areas on the planet than there are now. The findings are already helping a number of organizations: NGOs that want to understand where to best invest scarce dollars for sustainable growth; government agencies seeking to target resources locally for better outcomes; companies looking to reconfigure their geographic footprints to find new markets, employees, and resources, to name a few. “The two most common responses so far have been: ‘Wow, do you have more data?’ and ‘It’s much better news than I expected,’” says Chris. “But the one that will stay with me is the client who emailed to say ‘Thanks for the presentation. I’m hopeful in a way I’ve not been in some time.’” related The benefits of investing in better health: Insights from our new study Never miss a story"
McKinsey joins corporate affiliate program at Stanford HAI to bring AI and frontier tech to clients,McKinsey is collaborating with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) to help leaders realize the full potential of AI within their organizations.,2023-02-22T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20and%20stanford%20hai%20bring%20the%20power%20of%20artificial%20intelligence%20and%20frontier%20technologies%20to%20clients/stanfordhai-hero-small-1310750856-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Digital",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-and-stanford-hai-bring-the-power-of-artificial-intelligence-and-frontier-technologies-to-clients,"McKinsey joins corporate affiliate program at Stanford HAI to bring AI and frontier tech to clients February 22, 2023 AI promises to reinvent industries, and many business leaders are eager to understand how it can create value within their own living, breathing organizations. To help them make this leap, we are embarking on a new collaboration with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), an organization dedicated to guiding and building the future of artificial intelligence. “Many of our clients have a deep appetite for learning and foresight into how to best cope with the AI disruption in their organizations,” says Ben Ellencweig , a McKinsey senior partner. “Joining Stanford HAI’s corporate affiliate program gives us an opportunity to open up Silicon Valley with its leading-edge thinking, concentration of talent, and ecosystem of partners to all of our clients.” Together, we have created customized one-day learning programs for leaders that start with a live technology demo or a lab walkthrough with Stanford HAI academics and a review of the most relevant and recent research. This is followed by an afternoon workshop with McKinsey experts in which participants identify tangible next steps to apply the technology and create new opportunities in their business. “The curriculum covers AI and machine learning; AI and sustainability; the metaverse; and the digital economy and future of work”, explains Ben. “It’s one of the ways that we are helping businesses use technology and upskill their workforces to seed their own sustainable and inclusive growth.” The collaboration with Stanford HAI has been  a joint effort of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey and our Technology Council . The aim, according to McKinsey senior partner Lareina Yee , is to help participants not only understand the technology but also to experience it. “It’s a way we can help them lift their aspirations and imagine the future,” she says, “but we also ground that in practical considerations, like the investments required, how you participate in these new markets, the skills that will be needed, as well as understanding the inherent risks of the technology transition.” The program can be tailored to match the participants’ tech knowledge, from those in the early phases of understanding the most significant technology trends identified by the McKinsey Technology Council, all the way to early AI-adopters looking to implement generative AI into their tools and products . Stanford HAI brings together leading experts from a full array of disciplines—engineering, neuroscience, economics, psychology, medicine, entrepreneurship—to develop research and share findings, shape policy, and build partnerships, all with an eye to ensuring that AI technologies enhance the human experience. “Companies around the world are racing to leverage artificial intelligence,” says Stanford HAI co-director and Sequoia Professor of Computer Science Fei-Fei Li . “We are grateful to corporate affiliates like McKinsey for collaborating in ways that help advance AI research and practice to improve the lives of people.” Joining Stanford HAI’s corporate affiliate program gives us an opportunity to open up Silicon Valley with its leading-edge thinking, concentration of talent, and ecosystem of partners to all of our clients. For Stanford HAI faculty, the program offers a close-up look at some of the toughest challenges industries are grappling with today. For example, life sciences companies are turning to AI solutions to improve the efficacy of developing personalized drug therapies. Manufacturers are building AI-based digital twins of facilities before construction to prevent costly mistakes before they happen. Cutting-edge retailers and consumer goods companies are experimenting with the metaverse to create an entirely new category of customer experiences. “HAI has cultivated a community of the world’s foremost AI researchers who are eager to scale their work through real applications with businesses,” said Panos Madamopoulos , HAI Managing Director for Industry Programs and Partnerships. “ In a time of such rapid technological change, this conversation between academia and industry is essential not only for translating research into practical solutions, but also for ensuring the effective, safe, and ethical application of AI.” related New McKinsey survey reveals the AI tech-talent landscape Never miss a story"

Our approach involves changing the way leaders have thought about customer experience for decades. “Historically, companies invested in customer experience based on a belief that improvements in customer satisfaction would yield business results,” she says. “But it was always challenging to show the concrete return on their investments during the annual budgeting process.” What was so rewarding about partnering with this client was that we were able to create solutions that benefitted both their customers and teams. We’re proud of this impact, and humbled that we are also externally recognized. McKinsey helps clients “flip the script” by first defining the financial outcomes they expect to achieve through their investments in customer experience and then creating the experiences that drive the changes in customer behavior that lead to these financial outcomes. After first working with clients to define their vision, prioritize opportunities through predictive analytics , develop the roadmap, and quantify the financial value of their customer-experience strategy, our colleagues then create cross-functional teams with our clients to dramatically transform the experiences that matter most for clients. Finally, we build capabilities that support those changes within the client’s organization to make them stick for the long term. “This is a massive shift for our clients, who have been using survey metrics like NPS to measure the impact of their investments for 20 years,” Victoria says. “The widespread adoption of advanced analytics means they can now start with financial objectives like retention and share of wallet and identify the experience drivers that improve these metrics.” As senior partner Kevin Neher explains, it’s great that companies survey their customers—but relying solely on survey results means organizations are missing the bigger picture. “It’s not enough for customers to just know their customer. They also need to predict how customers are doing—and then act, whether that’s preempting a problem or providing a benefit. In that way, surveys become a much less important input,” he says. “Our approach is grounded in customer understanding using analytics that offer clients a privileged customer experience view that invites action, not just measuring and listening.” Recently, we brought this experience-led growth approach to customer experience strategy to a leading manufacturer that provides both B2B and B2C products and services. Despite a rich history in user-centered products, the organization hadn’t made customer experience a core part of their operating strategy. Together, our global team worked with the client to create a compelling vision for customer experience, inspired by their customers and employees; set clear priorities, backed by data and extensive research from 8,000 customers on what matters most to them; and develop a grounded value case to build momentum for future efforts. Our work allowed our clients to reduce the time required to resolve customer issues—from 7+ days to 1-2 days. Elsewhere, the organization saw a 13% increase in net sales. “What was so rewarding about partnering with this client was that we were able to create solutions that benefitted both their customers and teams,” says partner Oliver Ehrlich . “We’re proud of this impact, and humbled that we are also externally recognized as a leader in CX strategy consulting.” related McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology Never miss a story"

Yet, as just one example, at the current rate it will take another 151 years to close the global economic gender gap at all levels, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). To help address this disconnect, McKinsey partnered with WEF to form the Global Parity Alliance , a cross-industry group committed to driving better and faster outcomes for DEI initiatives. From 29 submissions, an independent panel evaluated DEI initiatives and found eight Lighthouses—those that resulted in significant, quantifiable, scalable and sustainable impact—and uncovered what their common success factor were. The panel of leaders from across the world brought various expertise gained from different sectors, and they identified five factors (detailed below) highlighted in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Lighthouses 2023 Report . The report was presented at a DEI event at Davos, hosted by McKinsey and led by senior partner and director of McKinsey Global Institute, Kweilin Ellingrud . She and McKinsey associate partner Stephanie Madner , who worked on the Lighthouses initiative, discuss the five success factors, the reaction to the report at Davos, and what’s next for DEI. What do we mean when we say DEI in this report? Kweilin: It was a very broad focus—gender, race, LGBTQ-inclusive. But we also had groups we don’t hear about as often, such as neurodivergent communities, and people with disabilities. And it was completely global, not just North America. How did the independent panel identify the successful Lighthouses and the five success factors? Stephanie: The five key success factors were distilled from the evaluation process, not determined ahead of time as criteria. They’re intended to be a guide for how to design and steward DEI initiatives for success. For instance, factor two, ‘ meaningful definition of success, ’ came from Lighthouses such as Schneider Electric, which made the clear goal to roll out their Global Pay Equity framework to 95 percent of their employees by 2020 and aimed for the pay gap not to exceed 1 percent for all employees by 2025. Kweilin: The panel looked for programs that were not short spurts, but initiatives that continue to deliver impact over time. This helped identify the fifth factor— ‘ rigorous tracking and course correction.’ For example, Randstad measured the effectiveness of its Hire Hope program by monitoring learner success throughout the program. In the first phase, it tracked if participants gained specific skills and in the last phase, it tracked if participants secured and held a full-time job. Randstad also collected feedback through check-ins at regular intervals, resulting in increased support measures, such as offering childcare and professional clothing. So many organizations say, ‘Give me inspiration. Show me that this is possible.’ Well, here it is. What is the right mindset for companies looking to embark on a DEI journey? Kweilin: You wouldn't expect a lift in profitability without systematic focus, getting to the root cause, tailoring your solutions, and then driving accountability in terms of metrics. You have to apply those same business principles to DEI, and I think the Lighthouse examples helped dispel the idea that this can be done successfully without that commitment. Stephanie: First, know that you’re part of a global community working on this. So many organizations say, “Give me inspiration. Show me that this is possible.” Well, here it is! Second, know that it’s not just about the program itself. This work often starts with becoming aware of unconscious biases that persist in industries traditionally led by white men. Which Lighthouses stand out to you personally? Stephanie: I was inspired by the approach of a consumer cosmetic company that held senior business leaders accountable for improving their ratio of women managers and leaders. The program’s results factored into leaders’ performance metrics and were tied to their compensation. This created an incentive to transform work policies to be more inclusive, redesign talent processes, and offer targeted upskilling. The CEO directly contributed to efforts by promoting the training program and coaching participants. The company saw the impact of this deep commitment with roughly 24 percent increase in the ratio of women leaders from 2017 to 2022. Kweilin: I loved the diversity of communities represented. For example, one organization completely redesigned their recruiting process and career paths to be more supportive of neurodivergent candidates—and it was championed by a neurodivergent senior leader. Another was focused on women who had experienced violence in their personal lives. The program helped them with job training, interviews, and placement in high-quality jobs, allowing them to build financial independence and a stronger sense of self. These DEI lighthouse examples, and many others, help us raise the bar on what is possible and what we can all do, both within our organizations and beyond. related Unlocking the potential of chief diversity officers Never miss a story"

However, many leaders overlook organizational health because they lack a clear way to measure and improve it. For a broad and deep assessment of a company’s wellbeing, McKinsey developed the Organization Health Index (OHI) , a digital survey tool that quantitatively diagnoses strengths and improvement areas, enabling organizations to create targeted action plans to improve their health and success. Some factors OHI assesses include its direction, leadership, employee motivation and capabilities, work environment, accountability measures, and more. Since OHI’s launch 20 years ago, more than 2,500 McKinsey clients in over 100 countries have utilized this tool to improve organizational health. “Organizational health matters,” says Alex Camp, a partner in McKinsey's People and Organizational Performance practice and OHI partner lead. “We've seen OHI deliver major returns for our for-profit clients. We wanted to bring that to organizations where returns are measured in social good; to small- and medium-sized nonprofits at scale."" A vibrant nonprofit sector, with healthy organizations equipped to realize their ambitious missions, is critical to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth around the world. Now, after a successful pilot with more than 70 nonprofits, OHI will be available free of charge to nonprofits around the world through the OHI for Nonprofits program . (Qualifying nonprofits can apply now through April 14, 2023 to enroll.) The pilot reached more than 4,000 employees at nonprofits operating in more than 45 countries. OHI is a great tool to help you peel back the curtain and find not only your weaknesses but what’s most important to your success OHI for Nonprofits is a core program of McKinsey.org , the firm’s philanthropic initiative promoting nonprofit successes. Nonprofits participating in this adapted version of OHI receive access to an organization-wide survey that diagnoses their current ways of working, identifying strengths and weaknesses in how their teams work together to advance their mission. Participating organizations receive a custom organizational health report, with a comparison to McKinsey’s nonprofit benchmarks and best practice resources to improve organizational health, such as webinars. McKinsey.org has already identified important insights for the nonprofit sector coming out of the program: 91 percent of staff at the healthiest nonprofits say their organizations are extremely effective at achieving their mission, whereas at the least healthy, it’s only 60 percent. Staff members who don’t believe their organization is extremely effective at achieving its mission are ten-times more likely to plan to leave the organization in the coming year. “Your talent wants a space that is inclusive and mission focused,” says Anu Gupta , leader of global social responsibility at McKinsey. “What nonprofits in the pilot found is that there were actionable steps they could take right away to make a major difference in the experience of their employees.” Indus Action is a social change policy nonprofit in India that participated in the pilot. It found OHI to be a key guide in shaping its future retention strategy. “We will be using OHI scores and data to address our retention challenges and strengthen employee engagement. The experience revealed so much about how these improvements can help us achieve our targets and goals,” says Achalika Ahuja, senior manager at Indus Action. Benchmarking scores against McKinsey’s nonprofit OHI benchmark helped Sports Backers , which inspires active living in Richmond, Virginia, to uncover new areas for improvement. “We identified a lack of clarity and effectiveness in our decision-making processes and will be implementing a detailed plan to improve efficiencies, increase transparency, and build employee ownership of decisions,” says Sports Backers executive director, Jon Lugbill. Jon would participate again to track progress over time and recommends other nonprofits take the OHI. “The OHI was a light-lift on our staff and proved invaluable to our goals,” says Jon. “If your organizational culture is open to change, then OHI is a great tool to help you peel back the curtain and find not only your weaknesses but what’s most important to your success.” Nonprofits interested in the OHI can check eligibility criteria and apply now through April 14, 2023. related New McKinsey survey reveals the AI tech-talent landscape Never miss a story"

March 22, 2023 In business today, the road from aspiration to impact is often paved with technology. Early this month, Barcelona hosted the first full-scale Mobile World Congress (MWC) in four years. It’s the biggest event in the connectivity industry and drew 88,500 visitors from 202 countries and territories. Nearly every McKinsey engagement today is a tech engagement, and dozens of McKinsey industry practitioners and experts in AI and analytics, ops, and marketing and sales attended. They moderated keynote panels, led roundtables and workshops, and met on topics including the metaverse, sustainability, AI and MLOps, and developing inclusive workforces and customer bases. MWC showcases the newest and most innovative digital tech. This year, attendees could ride a virtual reality air taxi, shop in a digital-twin store, and check out the latest mobile phones — with liquid cooling, rolling screens, folding cases, and satellite messaging. McKinsey senior partner attendees Andrea Travasoni, Ferry Grijpink , and Liz Hilton Segel described this year's event as upbeat, collaborative, and realistic, with an undercurrent of urgency. “Growth is the single most important topic on leaders’ minds,” said Andrea, who has served a number of telcos in Europe and hosted a CEO breakfast at the event. “They are focused on how to grow beyond their core business; how to create demand and win in new markets; identify the right partners; and attract the best talent.” Open Gateway , a new industry-wide initiative launched during the event by GSMA , a non-profit organization that works to advance the mobile-technology industry, is designed to do exactly this: promote growth that is lasting and inclusive by accelerating the innovation of new digital services. “A group of 21 telco operators representing 45 percent of mobile connections has agreed to collaborate and open up digital infrastructure, in a standardized way,” explains Ferry. “This allows cloud developers, telecom operators, and digital programmers to access capabilities, such as cybersecurity, identity, and billing, in a uniform way so they can more quickly and effectively develop new services using 5G and immersive technologies.” This is a major shift in the industry from competition between telco providers to collaboration, from selling connectivity to collectively operating a global infrastructure together. “The digital infrastructure was described as a ‘giant Earth computer,’ connecting people everywhere, from mountains to the most remote, rural areas,” recalls Ferry. “I think that was a beautiful metaphor of industry collaboration, which this agreement will help to promote.” Open Gateway could accelerate innovation on several fronts. In Barcelona, attendees viewed demos and discussions of the next-level of autonomous driving, truly immersive gaming and music, and various forms of drone farming, as a start. Are telco operators prepared for this new world?  Liz, who led the keynote panel on co-creation, believes so. “Many expressed a strong conviction about the need to evolve,” she said. “But I think this will require learning new skills, starting with creating the mindsets needed to function in a multi-party working group and the capability of building models such as joint ventures, alliances, and even acquisitions that will allow them to benefit from the relationships.” McKinsey often helps clients with these challenges, Liz adds. “We have experts who think creatively, and beyond today’s ways of working, to see a new future. They can also bring in examples from other industries.” It all adds up to a momentous time for telco operators, according Andrea. “When we think about bringing education to remote places; opening access to healthcare; expanding financial services to the poorest parts of the world, and more,” she says, “there is a desire on the part of telco operators to control their own destiny and the bright new future they can create collectively.” related The Mobile World Congress insights shaping our conversations with tech and telco leaders McKinsey joins telecom leaders to define and prepare for the future of connectivity Never miss a story"

This set of new commitments “builds on our work to create better outcomes around racial justice and equity, and gives every firm member the opportunity to be tangibly involved,” says Sara Prince , McKinsey senior partner and leader of the 10 actions. Action 7 articulated a bold goal focused on supplier diversity : to double our spending with diverse suppliers within three years, a goal we have now surpassed. “The firm has a deep and longstanding commitment to helping advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in business, in society, and within our firm,” says Scott Parris , chief procurement officer and McKinsey partner. “We are proud to have demonstrated that commitment, and we are just getting started. We will continue working to make it even easier for colleagues to find and choose diverse suppliers.” The benefits of supplier diversity flow in both directions. Increased spending with diverse suppliers leads to greater representation, employment, and economic advancement for diverse and small business communities. For McKinsey, new suppliers promote innovation through new products, services, and solutions, driving healthy competition with existing vendors. There is a robust philosophy behind our supplier diversity program, says Eyvon Austin, supplier diversity manager. “We’re ensuring our commitments to supplier diversity are firmwide, integrating elements such as clear spending goals across teams, supporting business development of diverse suppliers, and increasing our engagement with nonprofits that bring together diverse suppliers.” To achieve our objectives, two strategies in particular have proven instrumental: Connecting with and crafting opportunities for new diverse suppliers while continuing to nurture and grow our relationships with existing diverse suppliers. We felt comfortable because when you look at McKinsey’s history, their fingerprints are on things a lot deeper than supplier diversity. They've been providing high levels of social impact for a long time. Building new connections Diverse suppliers can face hurdles when competing for new business. While they often offer incredible service and value, diverse suppliers may not have the benefit of legacy business, contacts, access to capital, or other advantages that many competitors may have. In 2020, McKinsey worked to accelerate its approach to supplier diversity, with a focus on making it easier to find talented, diverse suppliers that we knew existed across our major spend categories. Our efforts, such as increasing collaboration with nonprofits that foster connection with diverse suppliers, helped unlock new relationships with a range of suppliers we had never worked with before—including World Wide Technology (WWT), the largest U.S. Black-owned business providing IT solutions and consulting. In 2022, McKinsey was proactive in establishing a relationship with WWT. Brett Kelley, McKinsey director of vendor management, and his team sought out WWT through our collaboration with the nonprofit National Minority Supplier Development Council. “We learned about WWT’s broad capabilities and shared values around diversity and innovation and together decided to build our relationship,” says Brett. Diverse suppliers often face challenges in the RFP process because their competitors have likely worked with the company before and have contracts from previous work to build on. Brett and the team moved to put a contract in place for WWT even before a specific opportunity arose to make them competitive in McKinsey’s bidding process. “In supplier diversity, we often deal with the ‘chicken or the egg’ paradox: the contract or the opportunity,” says Brian Sharpless, director of diversity business development at WWT. “But what McKinsey did was start laying the groundwork on a contract without a specific opportunity. That opened doors for us when the time was right.” Once WWT came on board, McKinsey worked to accelerate the relationship, sending a sizable amount of business to WWT in a short amount of time. “It usually takes a year or two to get to where we got in the first couple months with McKinsey,” says Frank Boensch, WWT’s regional sales manager for NY/NJ/PA. “They put a lot of trust in us on some pretty sizable deals.” The trust worked both ways. “We have a responsibility to bring the smaller minority-owned business and suppliers we work with along and pave the way, so we need to make smart decisions,” says Brian. “But we felt comfortable because when you look at McKinsey’s history, their fingerprints are on things a lot deeper than supplier diversity. They've been providing high levels of social impact for a long time.” Nurturing and growing existing relationships While WWT is a new supplier to the firm, McKinsey has been working with other diverse suppliers for years. One example is Corporate Concepts , a woman-owned business in Chicago that offers workplace furniture solutions and collaborates with businesses to create better workplace experiences. McKinsey has worked with Corporate Concepts for 17 years. When Jennifer Cusack founded Corporate Concepts in 1983, she knew of very few women who’d ventured into the commercial and office furniture business. But she took the leap. First-year sales topped $3 million—three times original projections. And the company has continued to grow steadily ever since. McKinsey began working with Corporate Concepts in 2006, and the relationship has continued to expand. “We started with a small project in Chicago and proved ourselves, and now we work on McKinsey offices all over North America,” says Jennifer. She brought in Jackie LeSavage as the relationship manager, who has been with the account ever since. “McKinsey has been a vital client because it is truly a collaboration. We are integrated into the planning and design process and are treated as partners,” says Jackie. “Not only has working with them grown our company’s size, but it has also helped us blossom professionally.” “When it comes to diversity and impact, McKinsey really cares,” says Jennifer. “They walk the talk.” To learn more about our supplier diversity efforts, or to work with us, visit McKinsey’s Supplier Diversity Program . related “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce Never miss a story"
"At SXSW 2023, advancing the future of sustainability, workplace inclusion, and more","Nine McKinsey partners participated in SXSW sessions on a wide range of topics, from F1 racing to alternative proteins, employee burnout, and beyond.",2023-04-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20at%20sxsw/sxsw23-hero-small-monne-jordan-nick-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Digital,Diversity",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-at-sxsw-2023,"At SXSW 2023, advancing the future of sustainability, workplace inclusion, and more From left, Monne Williams, a McKinsey partner, spoke about reducing workplace burnout; Joshua Bregler, a McKinsey cyber security expert, moderated a panel on digitizing armed services; and Nick Santhanam, a McKinsey alum and CEO of Fernweh Group, profiled the industrial tech industry April 6, 2023 Nine McKinsey colleagues spoke at this year’s South by Southwest (SXSW), the annual tech, media, and culture showcase in Austin, Texas. “It was a terrific opportunity to welcome clients, alumni, and guests to our new office in the heart of Austin, home to nearly 200 colleagues,” says Steven Smith , a member of the Austin leadership team. Read on for highlights from their talks, which touched on sustainability, inclusion, and much more. A hunger for alternative proteins Jordan Bar Am , a one-time schoolteacher in Morocco and fair-trade banana importer, now leads our work in alternative proteins. He took part in a SXSW panel with food-industry leaders who shared some of their newest innovations, such as Air Protein’s fermentation process, which creates meat out of air, water, and energy. Think: no agriculture or supply chain. And Believer Meats, which is building the first full-scale facility for producing cultivated lamb meat—without a single animal in sight. Alternative proteins are a fast-growing food category and a way to ease stress and volatility in food supply due to climate change. “I believe we are going to see more foods that are hybrids of these different technologies, rather than relying on a particular one,” says Jordan. Developing such complex products will require building stronger ecosystems, which is something McKinsey is uniquely suited to help do. “We work with many different potential partners,” he explains. “Investors seeking to deploy capital behind sustainable technologies; consumer companies, retailers and restaurants looking for ways to decarbonize; biochemical companies who have a unique innovation to contribute.” But food isn’t like other commodities; it has deep cultural and emotional aspects, and has to taste, smell, feel, and look good. All panelists agreed they had very demanding test markets to satisfy— starting with their households. Developing a trans-inclusive workplace “It’s a pretty lonely experience,” says Dani D’Amico , a McKinsey partner describing life as a transgender individual in the workplace. “The reaction I get on a daily basis is ‘I’ve never met a transgender person before.’” Dani, along with Sarah Greenberg , an associate partner, led an SXSW session on building trans-inclusive workplaces. Together, they answered questions from the group around some of the first, concrete steps organizations can take in order to get there. Efforts at McKinsey include initiatives such as pronouns campaigns and the use of preferred name versus a legal name in internal systems. “This affects every system that a person interacts with,” points out Sarah. “Our email, performance management system, badges in buildings. It’s a small thing that can really make a difference in the feeling of safety and belonging.” Formula 1 and the acceleration of mobility This November, Las Vegas hosts its first F1 Grand Prix in almost 40 years, with a brand-new circuit running around its famed strip. The city is expecting to welcome 300,000 fans and generate $1 billion in revenue from the event. In one panel, F1 leaders and McKinsey’s Philipp Kampshoff , a senior partner and co-founder of our Center for Future Mobility , and Abby Rakshit , mobility expert and co-host of the Racing Forces podcast, talked about how this premier sport is shaping the mobility industry in general. “Technologies such as KERS, or kinetic energy recovery system, which recoups energy while braking a car, started in racing and is now standard in hybrid and electric cars,” explained Philipp. Flying across the sea, propelled by AI F1 teams are using AI and machine learning for process innovation. From race to race, engineers tweak a digital-twin version of a car to improve say, aerodynamics, and then manufacture the corresponding improvement in carbon fiber components to install in the physical car for the next race. Every time there’s a new race they drive a new version of the car, never the same car twice. Such process innovation is becoming common in manufacturing. Th e panel also discussed how F1’s “development lab on wheels” could help accelerate the research and adoption of sustainable fuels for internal combustion engines and create a more holistic vehicle technology mix for a net-zero future. Putting the chill on burnout About one third of employees say they are experiencing burnout as they adjust to hybrid work and new requirements for being back in the office. “We are also seeing compassion fatigue—people exhausted from the stress of intensive management during a two-year crisis,” points out Monne Williams, a McKinsey partner. “The role of the manager is really important in helping individuals manage their burnout,” says Diana Ellsworth , also a partner. “A big part of that is pragmatic—helping them figure out and make good decisions about their workload. Rarely are there situations when you can’t prioritize, sequence, and/or determine what has to be done to the 100 percent mark, versus 80 percent. And it’s about helping people think through what exactly does ‘good’ look like?” It’s also about how you handle tough conversations, specifically in addressing toxic behavior, which is reported by half of employees as a key contributor to burnout. Diana advises focusing on the impact of the behavior in a factual, unemotional way: “This means clearly stating what the behavior resulted in: hurt feelings, inhibiting brainstorming, shutting down conversations—and how this leads to the team being less collegial, productive, inclusive; consequences that presumably the person doesn’t actually intend through their behavior.” And research shows that empathy—simply checking in and making it clear that you care about the well-being of your employees—matters a lot, in and of itself. related SXSW Interactive 2019: The big ideas that got us talking McKinsey experts bring sustainability and inclusion to the skies Never miss a story"
Investing in nature: Building local economies through conservation,"Through work with private sector and government clients, McKinsey is leading with technology to innovate and conserve natural resources, build Indigenous economies, and fight climate change.",2023-04-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/investing%20in%20nature%20building%20local%20economies%20through%20conservation/investingnature-hero-small-path-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/investing-in-nature-building-local-economies-through-conservation,"Investing in nature: Building local economies through conservation April 20, 2023 Is protecting nature and natural resources antithetical to growing the economy? These vital goals don’t have to be at odds. “Expanding areas of nature conservation and increasing investments is often seen as limiting job creation, but this tradeoff is often false,” says Duko Hopman , a McKinsey partner who focuses on nature conservation and natural capital innovation. “Entire communities’ economic activities rely on intact ecosystems and healthy natural capital.” Duko works on nature conservation projects from Fiji to Africa, and recently in Central America. One aspect of this work is expanding protected lands, which—while good for the environment—can restrict local economic activity, such as fishing. Alejandra Carson, a McKinsey business analyst based in Bogota, Colombia, traveled to various communities to understand their needs. She explained that through use of geospatial data from McKinsey, local authorities would be able to target areas that are most in need of conservation to protect fish populations. By opening specific areas for fishing, local communities can report their catch numbers, helping with monitoring and ensuring the optimal plan for preventing overfishing is in place. “These communities came in with a scarcity mindset, that this land and their livelihood would be taken away from them,” says Alejandra of her workshops with local communities and government stakeholders. “But they left understanding that this plan makes them part of a solution that ensures there will be fish for their children and grandchildren.” Executive insights, now for everyone McKinsey’s team of scientists, based in Belgium, uses analytics to determine where issues such as deforestation and natural resource depletion is most acute and then creates maps that outline where to plant trees or create conservation areas, calculating cost and risks to the area as the climate changes. “This use of analytics not only protects local communities and natural environments, but many corporate supply chains, which the data shows would see major disruptions without investments in the health of natural capital,” says Duko. We have the data now to show how important natural capital is and what the solutions are—it can no longer be ignored. Maintaining healthy ecosystems—forests, biodiversity, waterways, and more—is essential to sustaining communities, businesses, and the planet itself. It’s also key to fighting climate change. Yet while about 80 percent of global Fortune 500 companies have targets for carbon emissions reductions, less than 5 percent have the same targets for biodiversity and nature-related loss, says Kartik Jayaram , a McKinsey senior partner based in Nairobi, Kenya. “That is a very stark difference,” says Kartik. “Our research shows that companies can take actions on their own that can address many issues around nature conservation, particularly in retail and agriculture. We continue to work with them to move the needle.” The scale of repair to nature is large and the work ahead won’t be easy. But Duko is optimistic about what lies ahead. “It’s still possible to reverse this trend of natural capital degradation and keep the world economy within planetary boundaries. We have the data now to show how important natural capital is and what the solutions are—it can no longer be ignored,” says Duko. “McKinsey has a catalytic role to play,” Duko adds, “because we are in the privileged position of working with leaders across geographies and sectors to help scale the solutions and act now.” related To build a decarbonized future, McKinsey summit unites infrastructure leaders Never miss a story"
"McKinsey helps strengthen Generation, a nonprofit placing people in jobs worldwide","Generation has made quality employment a reality for tens of thousands. Now, they&rsquo;re equipped with improved data and technology to elevate the organization and its impact.",2023-05-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20helps%20transform%20global%20youth%20employment%20nonprofit/gentransf-hero-small-brazil-1536x864.jpg,Generation,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-helps-strengthen-generation-a-nonprofit-placing-people-in-jobs-worldwide,"McKinsey helps strengthen Generation, a nonprofit placing people in jobs worldwide Generation learners in Brazil. Generation has trained more than 77,000 people for jobs worldwide. May 3, 2023 Generation ’s impact has been remarkable since its 2014 inception. A global nonprofit, it provides high-quality job training and placement for people of all ages. What began as a small organization has now grown to operate in 17 countries, including Mexico, Italy, India, Kenya, the United States, and Brazil. To date it has trained more than 77,000 learners and placed 81 percent in jobs within three months of graduation with more than 11,000 employers. Together, Generation graduates have earned more than $630 million in salaries that can support them and their families. McKinsey helped found the organization and has since supported it with funding and people, including staff members who have joined Generation as short-term fellows and pro bono engagements to develop and strengthen the nonprofit. As May marks the beginning of graduation season in many countries, we take a moment to highlight this important work. “Generation is a model for tackling the global unemployment crisis,” says Lucy Pérez , McKinsey senior partner. “McKinsey is thrilled to partner with them to continue to expand their impact.” A people-centered approach To reach and engage so many, Generation relies on its digital ecosystem, a set of tools, platforms and user experiences, and the backend system that supports it. Candidate applications, volunteer recruitment, the learner portal, and mechanisms for learners to interface with teachers and employers, all hinge on the functionality of this operation. To be effective, it must be thoughtfully designed. Generation had been on a multiyear journey to embed human-centered design and improve its digital ecosystem so it can better serve the needs of learners, staff, and employers and fulfill its mission: to transform the way the education to employment system works around the world. “Automation and a well-designed user experience is critical to scale the country teams’ ability to reach more learners”, says Sergio Gutiérrez, McKinsey engagement manager. “Their processes were reliant on manual work and not standardized across geographies. This led to inefficiencies like the lack of consistent data collection and a huge burden on staff when engaging learners and employers.” McKinsey worked with Generation to accelerate its improvement, digitize more of its operation and overhaul its data architecture and user experiences—focused on learner and staff modules—with tangible results. For example, mentors now spend roughly 50 percent less time reviewing documentation ahead of mentorship sessions because of streamlined user experience and information and data consolidation about learner status. Revamping digital, data, and cloud systems is complex. Beyond the technical work, it required a deep study of the organization’s and stakeholders’ needs to successfully develop tools like the learner portal, the mentorship experience, and the employability platform that helps match learners with jobs. “We don’t have researchers on staff,” says Alma Angela Merino Cedeño , global director of digital at Generation. “McKinsey took the time for robust user-experience research across our channels, which had to be done before any line of code could be written. This also trained our team to do that job.” Where McKinsey was incredibly helpful was in defining our broader strategy and methodology and in working with us —it fundamentally changed how we operate as a team. Uniting a global organization A key element of this approach was building user profiles. With Generation’s operation spread out over 17 countries, its digital needs are not one size fits all. McKinsey gathered feedback from country stakeholders and uncovered distinct pain points, which included data access, data quality, and not having tools to share analysis. To address these, we took information from the profiles and business use cases, broke them up into technical capabilities and used these to assemble a cloud native architecture that could meet the needs of the global team. “We made sure that the new data architecture was designed for people first, for everyone in the ecosystem to come and use,” says Prasoon Sharma , a McKinsey partner. Generation had relied on manual surveys to refine its programs, which offer limited insights. McKinsey built feedback mechanisms into the learner platform for automatic seamless data collection. “Our program and impact data is not only more in-depth now, but we are able to gather it more often,” says Goldie Chow , global director of data & impact at Generation. “This is a game-changer for our ability to improve learner experience, learner support, and job placement.” The portal also included features for teachers, such as automating attendance tracking and communicating with students. Building enduring capabilities A central goal of the engagement was to embed these change methodologies throughout Generation to ensure they would last. Creating technological changes rippled to functions such as contracting, implementation teams, communications, finance, and operations. “Where McKinsey was incredibly helpful was in defining our broader strategy and methodology and in working with us—it fundamentally changed how we operate as a team,” says Alma. Besides working along with the McKinsey team, Generation’s digital team went through several McKinsey Academy programs to help embed their new practices. This has resulted in Generation moving to a full agile methodology and process, which, in addition to a new design system— has increased the speed of product development by 70 percent. All these elements make Generation’s operation more efficient, bringing them closer to their goal of transforming the lives of young people. “We’re all about connecting people to dignified work and a living wage, so the better we can understand how to operate, how to serve our learners, the better we're achieving our mission,” says Goldie. “In McKinsey, we’ve had a partner who took this to heart as much as we do.” related McKinsey organizational health survey now free for nonprofits Never miss a story"

Horizon was built within QuantumBlack Labs, our AI and machine learning innovation hub. This center consists of more than 250 technologists dedicated to driving AI innovation and supporting and accelerating the work of its more than 1300 data scientists across over 50 locations. QuantumBlack Horizon is a first-of-its-kind product suite helping organizations realize value from AI. Market studies indicate that approximately 90 percent of data science projects do not make it into production and usage in the field, suggesting the last five years of digital transformation have been defined more by proof-of-concept AI than operationalized value. The QuantumBlack Horizon suite integrates AI development tools. “This launch is the culmination of significant investments in technical talent and R&D over the last three years. It includes critical McKinsey acquisitions like Iguazio , a leader in machine learning technology,” says senior partner and QuantumBlack global coleader Alex Sukharevsky . “The launch of QuantumBlack Horizon supports our belief that realizing value from major technological advancements in AI and machine learning requires an industrialized and cohesive production system, tech stack, and operating model.” Creating value beyond the hype The QuantumBlack Horizon suite is built to be flexible, interoperable, and compatible with all key technology platforms and modern tech-stack components clients already have in place. The suite helps tech leaders achieve four key objectives in their AI initiatives: clean, organized, and accurate data across internal and external sources; scalable, repeatable AI models that build on each other; a factory-like approach to model development and monitoring; and performance transparency that enables quick, reliable decision making. “When it comes to AI, business leaders can learn a lot from their counterparts in Formula One racing, where QuantumBlack has its heritage using AI to dramatically improve car performance,” says Matt Fitzpatrick , senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack Labs. The QuantumBlack Horizon suite of products “Before the race, there are thousands of hours of car design, engineering optimization, and wind-tunnel testing, all of which lead an engineering team to believe that a car will perform well. But then there is the race itself, with rain, spinouts, and tire issues, which requires numerous engineering refinements. Success is determined by how a car tests, learns, and evolves over the course of a season and how it performs in the race—not in the wind tunnel.” “We see a lot of technology organizations focused on engineering metrics as the main KPI, like number of initiatives launched, data moved into a warehouse, or predicted improvement in a model,” he continues, “but the north star for all our AI initiatives should be field performance. We believe that live test-and-learn cycles help organizations consistently reach the next horizon of machine learning—and are more meaningful than building a perfect AI model during the development phase.” QuantumBlack Horizon will power two important dimensions of our client work in AI and machine learning. It will be the foundation for all our sector-based analytical offerings, such as pharmaceutical and medical-product solutions for pharmaceutical R&D and clinical-trial optimization. It also will provide the underlying technology stack for our firm’s first work in deploying and driving value from generative AI and foundation models. “Our approach to AI is relentlessly focused on real-world impact,” says Alex Singla , senior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack. “The introduction of QuantumBlack Horizon represents a significant step forward, as we bring together leading technology and software that has been used on hundreds of projects globally.” To learn more about what QuantumBlack Horizon can do for you, please email Yetunde Dada .

Helping an Atlanta hospital foundation tell its story and improve community health,"A group of McKinsey colleagues partnered with Grady Health Foundation to share its story, impact, and vision for holistic health in Georgia&rsquo;s capital city.",2023-06-08T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/helping%20an%20atlanta%20hospital%20tell%20its%20story/grady-hero-1536x864.jpg,Social Impact,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/helping-an-atlanta-hospital-tell-its-story,"Helping an Atlanta hospital foundation tell its story and improve community health Grady collaborates with many organizations in Atlanta, including Georgia State University, where a joint partnership aims to strengthen nursing recruitment. Photo Credit: Meg Buscema, Georgia State University June 8, 2023 If you want to know what Grady Hospital and its health foundation mean to the city of Atlanta, just look to their location. The main campus sits in the heart of downtown, just blocks from the Georgia State Capitol and several Georgia State University buildings. The Downtown Connector—the stretch of highway where Interstates 75 and 85 run concurrent through the city—even has a portion known as the “Grady Curve,” a nod to the institution’s location. In many ways, Grady represents the heart of the city. “The hospital and its foundation serve the Atlanta community in the broadest sense of that word,” says David Bueno , a partner based in Atlanta. Compared to other hospitals in the city, Grady serves a high percentage of uninsured patients, or those who switch between being uninsured, having Medicaid coverage, and getting employer-sponsored insurance. “Most locals know Grady hospital is the only Level 1 trauma center here, but Grady has had a holistic impact on Atlanta, from providing care for public servants and employing thousands of residents, to giving years of health back to families in the community,” he says. It’s this story about the hospital’s impact that the Grady Health Foundation—a not for profit that fundraises for the hospital system—sought to tell when it approached McKinsey’s Atlanta office last year. A small group of colleagues worked on the effort as part of the Atlanta Community Consulting initiative, which pairs interested colleagues with short-term volunteer projects. In addition to developing its narrative, the McKinsey team worked with Grady to communicate its impact to the individuals and groups best able to help fund the hospital. “There’s a common misconception that Grady is completely supported by public funding, or a combination of public funding and insurance, when in fact, the hospital system needs philanthropic support from individuals and institutions alike to close the gap between the cost of care and what those funding sources provide,” says Joselyn Butler Baker, president of the Grady Health Foundation. Another challenge? The reality that the hospital relies on support from individuals who may never need to use Grady. “Most people know us as a trauma center, or safety net hospital, or a medical home for the uninsured, so we are grateful for McKinsey’s help in telling our broader story to people who may not be familiar with how keeping our patients healthy also improves community health at large,” Baker says. As part of our work together, our analysis found that Grady strengthens the Atlanta metro community and improves lives by returning a collective 6,000 years of healthy life to patients each year. That leads to an additional 650,000 hours spent exercising, 1.3 million hours spent with families, and nearly $350 million in additional GDP as a result of people who can return to work after being treated there. “Grady isn’t just saving lives, but improving livelihoods,” says Camille Gregory, an engagement manager. “I’m not sure any of us on the team were aware of just how broad Grady’s impact is in the community—even though we all know it’s this iconic institution in Atlanta.” There’s a common misconception that Grady is completely supported by public funding, or a combination of public funding and insurance, when in fact, the hospital system really relies on the philanthropic support of individuals and institutions alike. Paul Sperduto, an associate partner and Atlanta native, says it was inspiring getting to serve an institution that he has grown up knowing—and that has provided both emergency and longer-term care to his family members. “I grew up knowing that Grady provides critical care to anyone who needs it, but I was surprised to learn just how many doctors at other local hospitals did their residencies there,” he says. “It’s a great example of how Grady touches different parts of the community.” As a result of our partnership, Grady is sharing its impact story in communications with everyone from local community organizations and donors to state and local leaders. Baker says the analysis will also help the foundation more effectively demonstrate how much the hospital’s influence radiates beyond patients to the community at large. “We are seeking philanthropic support to help us ensure access to care to everyone who calls Atlanta home,” she says. “This has been our mission for 130 years and that’ll never change.” related McKinsey organizational health survey now free for nonprofits"

A native of Johannesburg, South Africa, Portia grew up in the township of Sebokeng, one of many historically segregated neighborhoods established during apartheid. Born to a mother who worked as a cashier and a father who worked as a security guard, Portia was the first in her family to graduate from university. At the time Portia saw McKinsey’s post, she’d left the township and was living with her husband in a nearby suburb, where she ran a cleaning business and served as a trainee auditor before later becoming a junior lecturer in management accounting at North-West University. Our 2022 ESG report “I felt like I didn’t know which avenue I wanted to explore, and I wanted to find order to what I was doing,” says Portia, who is featured on the cover of our 2022 ESG report, Creating a more sustainable, inclusive, and growing future for all . “The Forward program’s language about being agile, a self-leader—that really spoke to me. I decided to go for it.” Launched in 2021, Forward offers five months of online courses and virtual workshops to equip young talent with business, digital, and leadership skills—applicable across all industries and careers. Portia became a member of the program’s first-ever cohort, completing both levels of the program: Foundation and Advanced. Portia describes herself as shy, often finding it challenging to assert herself in professional situations. She knew she had “more to offer but struggled to find her confidence and the ‘soft skills’ needed in the workplace.” A closer look at Forward Her participation in Forward turned things around. The curriculum aims to shape its students’ understanding and application of communication skills, delivering and receiving feedback, developing efficiency, problem-solving skills, building networks, and more. “The program gave me structure,” Portia recalls. “I didn’t have a framework for how I presented myself, how I interacted with people, how to advocate for myself. I started to notice I was able to think on my feet and voice my ideas.” May Wazzan, who leads Forward for McKinsey, says the program was designed to give early career starters the awareness, structure, and safe space to build essential workplace skills like adaptability, communication, problem solving, and agile ways of work, among others. “Over 95 percent of program graduates credit Forward for boosting their confidence to tackle diverse workplace challenges,” May says. “We believe this is a result of practical content that is directly applicable in the workplace, real-time interaction with peers and experts, and the growth mindset that is fostered throughout the journey.” It's a beautiful thing to walk in confidence, especially if you didn't have it before. I can’t overstate the impact Forward has had on my life. When Portia was teaching a management accounting module at North-West University, a notoriously difficult class, she knew getting through to the students who were ambivalent about the course would be a challenge—especially given her shy nature. To her surprise, however, she found a new approach to communication with her class. Realizing most of what stands in the way of students’ success is the fear of failing the course, she put her problem-solving skills to work and set out to put them at ease. “I started with being empathetic and just debunking myths around management accounting, taking time to talk with them about the field, and answering questions. I called these ‘social classes,’” she says. These informal classes weren’t on the syllabus, but she convinced her manager of the approach and got the green light. She saw a notable increase in exam scores throughout the semester. “I was someone who would never have done that before joining Forward. I would have stuck to the rules, went to class, taught, and been scared to speak up,” she says. Portia remains an active member of Forward’s alumni community and was selected as one of the first 11 volunteer ambassadors. The volunteer-ambassador journey was established by the Forward team as an opportunity for program graduates to shape its future by driving outreach and community engagement and collaborating with peers on projects that amplify Forward’s impact. The focus she gained in the program cemented her career path: she wants to be a chartered accountant.

Not everyone comes to the firm fully out, either to themselves or to their families. As we celebrate Pride, we are inspired by three colleagues who have faced the personal battle of coming out in their time at the firm, and in turn found the firm to be an integral part of breaking barriers in addressing their identities. Maurice Obeid , senior partner Maurice grew up in Byblos, a city of about 40,000 people on the coast of Lebanon, where he did not experience a visible LGBTQ+ community. A veteran of the firm for 13 years, Maurice first came to the United States for his undergraduate studies. He was out when he joined the firm, but it wasn’t until McKinsey’s global conference for Equal at McKinsey members early in his tenure that he began to celebrate his identity. “Coming from a background where being gay wasn’t seen or encouraged… it was incredible to be with colleagues from around the world where that part of me was embraced and welcomed in a community,” he says. This new confidence and support became a driving force in Maurice’s career. Among his many achievements are becoming a leader in the North America chapter of Equal at McKinsey, a lead author of McKinsey’s seminal research on being transgender in the workplace , a board member at the Lesbian & Gay Community Services Center (the Center), and one of Crain’s New York Business “2023 Notable LGBQIA+ Leaders .” “Bringing all of these LGBTQ+ elements into my work—it’s unbelievable how I’ve gone from a place of shame to a place of strength,” he says. “I’m not sure this would have happened without the supportive community at the firm.” Eleonora Sharef , partner A native of Colombia who also grew up in Germany, Eleonora’s LGBTQ+ awakening happened in Australia. She’d settled in New York City with the firm but had the opportunity to work in Australia for one year in 2008. At the time she wasn’t out to anyone—including herself. One night, friends from the firm invited her to an LGBTQ+ event. With some butterflies in her stomach, she attended, buoyed by the safety and freedom of being away from friends and family. She knew right away that she belonged. “I could safely be who I was with no one judging me,” she says. “I came out at work with colleagues and clients, and it was so positive. McKinsey Australia gave me the chance to experience being out before having to come out in my ‘real’ life.” After Australia, she was living out and proud, working for the firm in Brazil. She started a tech company in San Francisco, where she lived in the city’s Castro district. She ultimately returned to the firm in New York, where she met her wife, a former firm colleague. They now have two children together. While she remains an active member of Equal at McKinsey and speaks with colleagues about building families with same-sex parents, she’s also focused on her involvement with the firm’s Hispanic leadership network. Additionally, she coleads sustainable and inclusive growth for the firm’s insurance work, aiming to make the industry more environmentally conscious and inclusive. “I have been able to blend my passion for sustainable and inclusive growth with my client work,” Eleonora says. “This encompasses many interest areas—and certainly LGBTQ+ inclusion is key. I am especially grateful that I can bring my whole self to the firm.” Jericho “Cep” Concepcion , IT analyst Cep is from Manila, Philippines.  “There’s a contradiction between fun drag culture and celebrity icons, and true support for queer people,” says Cep. “Growing up, I felt the degrading stigma toward gay people.” Cep says his high school administrators suspected he was gay based off stereotypes in his behavior and the company he kept. The principal reported him to his parents, and Cep denied it to everyone, including himself, fearing their disappointment and even conversion therapy. He stayed in the closet until he joined the firm. “I didn’t dare to pick this conversation up until after joining McKinsey and Equal at McKinsey. I’d never felt so much love, support, and acceptance as a gay man. I could finally breathe, and they gave me the courage to be my true self,” says Cep. This support led Cep to join the global Equal at McKinsey strategy team, serve on the Equal at McKinsey Asia regional leadership team, and be involved in pro bono projects supporting not-for-profit organizations. This included helping an LGBTQ+ organization in India publish a report on entrepreneurship and supplier diversity —all outside his core work in tech. He’s recently relocated to McKinsey’s Prague office and serves on the Equal at McKinsey Europe team. Before he relocated, he had a moment he never thought he’d have: he came out to his family. At a Equal at McKinseyevent before he left Manila, his father shared a personal story with Cep’s fellow Equal at McKinsey members and allies. His father recalled his vulnerable journey as a parent that he would not have a “normal” son, that he never thought this “issue” would come to his family, and even explored if it could be “reversed.” But that was all in the past. Now that Cep is out and proud, his father “accepts him for what he is, and not for what he isn’t.” Sadly, Cep’s father passed away shortly after that Equal at McKinsey event. “It was humbling to have that gift, to finally see my father express his love and acceptance for who I truly am in front of my friends, mentors, and colleagues—before he left. I never thought I’d see that day in my lifetime.” related “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce Never miss a story"
&ldquo;A human in the loop is critical.&rdquo; McKinsey leaders on generative AI at US media day<br />,"Journalists hear from firm leaders on how companies are being compelled to adapt to the groundbreaking technology in weeks, not months or years",2023-07-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/keep%20the%20human%20in%20the%20loop/mckinsey_blog_keepthehumanintheloop_1536x864px_hero_option.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/keep-the-human-in-the-loop,"“A human in the loop is critical.” McKinsey leaders on generative AI at US media day From left to right: McKinsey's Jacky Wright, Asutosh Padhi, and Olivia White speaking at the firm's media day event on June 6, 2023 in New York. July 3, 2023 It is half a year since the launch of ChatGPT—a technology that thrust generative AI into the spotlight and into the hands of the masses. While its full impact is still to be determined, it’s clear that this technology is becoming a disruptor across all industries, with the potential to disrupt nearly every part of a business. But leaders still have more questions than answers: What specific use cases will impact my business? What risks must be managed? How does this change the way we think about talent and people? These questions and more came up in a lively discussion during McKinsey’s recent US media day, Halftime Report: A Mid-Year Update on the CEO Agenda . At a gathering attended by US-based business journalists, leaders from across the firm explored pressing topics they’ve heard from clients, with three themes dominating the agenda: generative AI, the future of work, and the crucial role of productivity in driving economic growth. Generative AI Senior partner Ben Ellencweig, who leads alliances and acquisitions at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, noted that companies are learning about generative AI at an accelerated pace, and are compelled to adapt to the groundbreaking technology in weeks, not months or years. In a discussion moderated by Axios ’s global-technology correspondent Ryan Heath, Ben urged business leaders to be mindful of “the four Cs”: coding—citing productivity gains of 35-55 percent among client software developers using generative AI tools as they code— customer engagement and creating more personalized interaction, creative content generation, and content synthesis. “Generative AI is becoming the virtual knowledge worker,” said Ben, “with the ability to connect different data points, summarize and synthesize insights in seconds, allowing us to focus on more high-value add tasks.” Senior partner and McKinsey’s chief technology and platform officer Jacky Wright added that the ability for technology to take over a selection of simple or repetitive tasks will open up possibilities for workers to engage in more creative or cognitively focused pursuits. “There will be new roles, and new business models based on generative AI,” she said. At least some of those new roles, the senior partners agreed, will be dedicated to answering the question of how best to employ generative AI technologies. “For most generative AI insights, a human must interpret them to have impact,"" added QuantumBlack global leader Alex Singla . "" The notion of a human in the loop is critical.” It was noted that much of McKinsey’s recent work has involved thinking through the risk and regulatory considerations surrounding generative AI for clients, and its potential impact on the workforce. The firm recently published a report, “ The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier ,” which explored how AI technology could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, while also transforming business operations across all sectors. In the second session, senior partner and chief people officer Katy George was joined by senior partner Scott Blackburn and partner Anu Madgavkar to debate the future of work. The conversation, which was moderated by Wall Street Journal deputy bureau chief for the careers and workplace department, Vanessa Fuhrmans, focused on the growing expectations of employees to develop their skillsets at work while striking the right balance between home and in-person working. For most generative AI insights, a human must interpret them to have impact. The notion of a human in the loop is critical. “We’re seeing a need for more micro-opportunities to help people see the advancement they’re making,” said Katy, “so people can plot their own career path and author it themselves with credentials that are valuable internally and externally.” Productivity was the final topic of the day. Improvements in labor productivity have been the engine of US economic power and prosperity since World War II, but in the past 15 years, productivity growth has faltered, averaging under 1.4 percent annually, compared to long-term rates of 2.2 percent. Marketplace Morning Report host David Brancaccio was joined by senior partner and North America managing partner Asutosh Padhi , McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) director Olivia White , and partner Ezra Greenberg to dig into the factors holding institutions back from peak productivity—and how to solve for them. “The most productive companies are the most resilient in the face of economic downturn,” Asutosh explained. “As CEOs navigate historic tightness across both capital and talent, productivity is not an answer to growth and economic prosperity… it is the only answer.” McKinsey’s media days are part of an ongoing series of events offering members of the press an opportunity to get the latest perspectives from our leaders, who outline the most pressing issues that CEOs are facing today. related McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology Never miss a story"
"Generative AI can give you &ldquo;superpowers,&rdquo; new McKinsey research finds","Meet the leadership team behind our flagship research, which looked at generative AI in terms of productivity gains for the economy, businesses, and individual workers.",2023-07-06T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/generative%20ai%20can%20give%20you%20superpowers%20new%20mckinsey%20research%20finds/mckinsey_blog_genairesearchreport_hero_1536x864px.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/generative-ai-can-give-you-superpowers-new-mckinsey-research-finds,"Generative AI can give you “superpowers,” new McKinsey research finds July 6, 2023 Over the past six months, workers across industries, from marketers and developers to product designers, have been discovering the ways in which generative AI can help them do their jobs better. This could mean creating extraordinary content in a fraction of the time, accelerating IT coding and testing processes, optimizing product simulations and design for much higher quality. In short, generative AI can give them “superpowers.” In our newest report, “ The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier ,” the firm’s researchers also project that generative AI can add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the economy annually. The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier “It's very compelling on a personal level because almost everyone can use it,” explains Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) partner. “Generative AI has captured the imagination of business leaders in a way many tech trends don’t. If I talk about the cloud or quantum computing, it’s not something someone can touch. But with ChatGPT, you can open your browser and start asking it questions.” With the right prompts, ChatGPT can write a short story, summarize 1000 pages into a five-point plan, or even compose a song. While generative AI is off to a blazing start, we know from experience that gaining the full value from a technology and implementing it across an organization takes time, talent, and hard work. Here’s what three of our experts— Alexander Sukharevsky , senior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, Michael Chui , and Lareina Yee , a McKinsey senior partner, have learned from the research and from early adopters. Let’s start with the big question: What is McKinsey doing about generative AI right now? Alexander: We have been investing in AI for many years and generative AI is not new for us; our first investment in the space was around five years ago. Our focus remains on creating and scaling enterprise-grade solutions. To do this, we have a deep talent pool—more than 1,500 data scientists and engineers in more than 50 countries—and an extensive ecosystem of external partners. Earlier this month, we launched QuantumBlack Horizon , a suite of solutions specifically created to help businesses scale AI, including generative AI, in a secure, cost effective way. What can we learn from early adopters’ experiences? Alexander: The CEO conversation has changed from a few weeks ago from “What is this?” to “What do I do about it in my organization and how to start?” On the strategic level, first you need to bring your best talent together—a multidisciplinary group of technical and nontechnical people—to learn about the technology to establish a common language and to reimagine your business model and potentially redefine your respective industry. It doesn’t have to take long—I believe this is a real “age of creators.” Multiple industries will be completely revamped by using AI to lower the barriers to entry, to disintermediate company structure, or to deliver the same value propositions at a fraction of the current cost. The way organizations define the opportunities and the execution speed will differentiate the future winners. We’ve seen some fatigue around AI implementations, but the energy created by generative AI has brought AI projects back into the spotlight and reinforced the need for companies to fix the same basics—the quality and availability of data, the IT architecture, technology and translator capabilities, and rewired operating models. It's not easy, but essential for long-term success. Let’s talk a bit about the research and key findings. Michael: We used a methodology established in 2017 to analyze how automation technologies are impacting the labor force. We looked at 850 occupations across 47 countries, covering about 80 percent of the world's workforce. We then broke down each occupation into 20 or 30 “sub-activities.” In terms of generative AI, we analyzed tasks such as understanding natural language, communicating with others, searching for and gathering information. We estimate that about 60-70 percent of the time people spend working has the theoretical potential to be transformed by a combination of generative AI with other technologies. While it could take years for this to be realized, the potential is huge. In fact, we updated our models for the rate at which these technologies might be deployed, and in some scenarios, generative AI could accelerate the pace of adoption by a decade, compared to our previous estimates. In terms of use cases, while there is potential across the enterprise, 75 percent of the potential value from generative AI is concentrated in four functions: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D. What does this mean for the average worker? Lareina: We say that generative AI gives people “superpowers.” What we mean is that it can automate many of the routine tasks that people do during their workday, so now they can be more productive and do more interesting work. The technology can function as your coding assistant, your researcher, even your editor. In early use cases in call centers, we see generative AI helping representatives with less tenure, say at level one, advance to a level four much faster. With AI, they have techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts, such as quality scripts and detailed customer context, preparing them to handle increasingly complex situations more quickly. They spend less time creating materials, more time with their customers. In general, people are pretty excited about this. If you are a software developer, generative AI can do the more routine tasks of converting legacy code, debugging and testing, so you can spend more time developing new functionality. Wealth managers can spend more time advising their clients, rather than analyzing and summarizing large quantities of technical content. In general, workers can spend more time on the human connection and interaction aspects of their roles, which is something AI can't take away. What are the implications for organizations as a whole? Michael: It means there's going to be a lot of change as we all will have to shift the activities of what we do. Some jobs will change, some will go away, and new ones will be created, such as a prompt engineer. It’s a huge reskilling challenge and opportunity. On the other hand, it could provide a time surplus that may be used to create a different work-life balance—it could even be the start of the four-day work week. related McKinsey joins corporate affiliate program at Stanford HAI to bring AI and frontier tech to clients McKinsey named a Leader in AI Service Providers by Forrester Never miss a story"

McKinsey and Cohere will harness the power of generative AI—the ability of machines to create and use human language—to drive clients’ business performance through tailored end-to-end solutions. The collaboration will be led by QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, the firm’s industry-leading AI arm, with thousands of practitioners including data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers. McKinsey and Cohere will help organizations integrate generative AI into their operations, redefine business processes, train and upskill workforces, and use this emerging technology to tackle some of the toughest current challenges. “Every client context, use case, and organization is unique, but they are all looking for the right generative AI solution tailored for their needs to address privacy, IP protection, and cost,” says Ben Ellencweig , a McKinsey senior partner and global leader of alliances and acquisitions for QuantumBlack. “Together with Cohere, we are excited to launch secure, enterprise-grade generative AI solutions for our clients, moving from discussing productivity and growth opportunities to capturing value on the ground, day to day.” With headquarters in San Francisco and Toronto, and a key research center in London, Cohere employs hundreds of experts, including AI machine learning, and software engineers, as well as data scientists and researchers who have made formative contributions to the development of generative AI. Cofounded by Aidan Gomez , a Google Brain alum and coauthor of the seminal transformer research paper, Cohere describes itself as being “on a mission to transform enterprises and their products with AI to unlock a more intuitive way to generate, search, and summarize information than ever before.” One key element of Cohere’s approach is its focus on data protection, deploying its models inside enterprises’ secure data environment. Creating value beyond the hype “We are both independent and cloud-agnostic, meaning we are not beholden to any one tech company and empower enterprises to implement customized AI solutions on the cloud of their choosing, or even on-premises,” says Martin Kon , COO and president of Cohere. “Data privacy, data security, and customization are critical to creating strategic differentiation and real business value. McKinsey and Cohere share a vision of partnering closely with clients, using AI to transform businesses, and prioritizing responsible and data-secure implementation of this technology.” Our conversations with CEOs have rapidly shifted from curiosity about generative AI to more practical considerations around how to use this technology to create value throughout their organizations Models are only one part of the answer and together, the QuantumBlack and Cohere teams will: “Together with Cohere, we are excited to launch enterprise-grade generative AI solutions for our clients—moving from discussing the opportunities to capturing them in profit-and-loss statements,” says Alexander Sukharevsky , a senior partner and global leader at QuantumBlack. “We are already working side-by-side on reimagining business models and industries, gaining immediate productivity boosts, and launching digital and AI transformations to capture those at scale while managing risks and costs.” Generative AI Several companies have already started experiencing the benefits of the McKinsey collaboration with Cohere. Together, the teams are helping a financial-services group implement generative AI to manage routine customer feedback in more than 100 languages. The work will dramatically reduce customer wait times, freeing up representatives to manage more complex situations. McKinsey and Cohere are also developing a generative AI solution to help a company improve its product development by bringing together product requirements and past designs to optimize the creation of future designs. The process will ensure that new product plans are fully informed by existing product specifications and insights, shortening time to market, and producing significant savings. “Our conversations with CEOs have rapidly shifted from curiosity about generative AI to more practical considerations around how to use this technology to create value throughout their organizations,” said Alex Singla , a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack. “We’re thrilled to work with Cohere to help companies implement AI in a way that fits business priorities and risk tolerance.” See more collaborations on McKinsey’s open ecosystem of acquisitions and alliances. related Generative AI can give you “superpowers,” new McKinsey research finds McKinsey launches new product suite to help clients scale AI Never miss a story"

August 2, 2023 It was a blast from the future. On a damp evening last week in London, a new Formula E electric race car called GENBETA tore across the floor of EXCEL London, the home of the Hankook London E-Prix, hitting 218.71 kilometers per hour (135.9 mph). About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, helps harness the power of hybrid intelligence to create unimagined opportunities in a constantly changing world. Transform faster. Innovate smarter. Anticipate the future. At QuantumBlack, we unlock the power of AI to help organizations reinvent themselves from the ground up—and accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth. We do this by harnessing the foresight and precision of data and technology with the creativity and understanding of people. The result? Hybrid intelligence, a source of competitive advantage that transforms how companies think, operate, and disrupt. Our approach is relentlessly focused on real-world impact. QuantumBlack was born and proven in Formula 1, where teams live and breathe data. As the AI consulting arm of McKinsey, we blend powerful AI and cutting-edge solutions with deep strategic thinking and domain expertise to help our clients innovate and develop new opportunities. Formula E is part of the FIA World Championship, racing electric vehicles across the world in city circuits and constantly pushing the electric-vehicle performance and innovation agenda forward. They did on this night. The run set a new Guinness World Record for indoor land speed—and reminded all of us that the pace of innovation has never been faster. We are proud to have played a role in this effort. Experts from McKinsey’s AI arm, QuantumBlack , built data-and-analytics components to create the driver interface that analyzed and queried data in real time through generative AI for the record attempt. We did so in partnership with Google Cloud, whose GenAI solutions, including their off-the-shelf large language model, underpinned the platform and enabled us to go from design to use in three weeks. “Being involved in this effort was humbling and exhilarating,” says McKinsey associate partner Kayla Miele , who was on hand for the record-breaking run. “A new indoor land-speed world record is such a visceral expression of impact—and how powerful this technology can be when the right partners put it to work in the right way.” QuantumBlack’s Formula E collaboration was also on display at the 2023 Hankook London E-Prix over the weekend, where a McKinsey-built, generative-AI-powered conversational interface converted data into insights in milliseconds and delivered them to fans in the “voice” of the car. This highlighted one of generative AI’s most powerful, and inclusive, value propositions: giving more people the ability to engage and work with highly-technical datasets. “The entire setup was housed in an engineering station next to the racetrack,” says McKinsey engagement manager Dominic Stevens . “Fans of all ages were able to ask questions and engage in conversation with the record-breaking car via the generative AI-powered interface, which told them everything they wanted to know about the race and the performance of the cars shooting past them.” The Formula E work is just the latest example of several exciting moves McKinsey has made in the AI space this year. In addition to publishing industry-leading reports on the technology, including our flagship study The economic potential of generative AI , we acquired a top AI and machine-learning firm, Iguazio, to accelerate and scale AI deployments for clients. Creating value beyond the hype “Iguazio will enable us to implement AI with fewer resources at significantly lower cost,” Alex Singla , McKinsey senior partner and QuantumBlack global co-leader, said in a McKinsey blog post. “This is especially meaningful for companies experiencing a critical shortage of tech talent, one of the reasons many AI projects have been delayed.” We also launched QuantumBlack Horizon, a set of AI development tools built within QuantumBlack Labs, our AI and machine learning innovation hub. QuantumBlack Horizon is a first-of-its-kind product suite helping organizations realize value from AI. “The launch is the culmination of significant investments in technical talent and R&D over the last three years. It includes critical McKinsey acquisitions like Iguazio , a leader in machine learning technology,” Alex Sukharevsky , senior partner and QuantumBlack global coleader, said in a McKinsey blog post. “The launch of QuantumBlack Horizon supports our belief that realizing value from major technological advancements in AI and machine learning requires an industrialized and cohesive production system, tech stack, and operating model.” Most recently, we announced a new strategic collaboration with Cohere , the leading developer of enterprise AI platforms and state-of-the-art large language models. The collaboration will help clients harness the power of generative AI to drive business performance through tailored end-to-end solutions. Collaboration was also at the heart of the land-speed attempt. Driver Jake Hughes of NEOM McLaren Racing Formula E Team broke the Guinness World Record. He was pushed by Mahindra Racing team driver Lucas di Grassi in a “duel” format, which saw the drivers try to outdo each other in timed solo runs on the track. Google Cloud provided technology innovations on the GENBETA car, along with generative AI for analysis of the drivers’ runs. Design modifications to the car included enhanced battery-power output, softer tires, and 3D printed components to optimize aerodynamics. It all came together into a recipe for the record books. “Our colleagues do amazing things every week,” Rodney Zemmel , McKinsey senior partner and McKinsey Digital’s global leader said, “but helping a team get in the Guinness Book of World Records with a partner like Google Cloud is a pretty good week.” related McKinsey and Cohere collaborate to transform clients with enterprise generative AI McKinsey acquires Iguazio, a leader in AI and machine-learning technology Never miss a story"

It welcomed more than 300,000 visitors eager for industry insights around the applications of AI, overcoming supply-chain difficulties, delivering on sustainable-aviation objectives, and what the future of air mobility could look like. McKinsey hosted a range of aerospace innovation sessions at this year's event, covering topics such as the disruptive power of AI and advanced machine learning, and how to drive sustainability along every aspect of the value chain, from engineering to aftermarket services. Expert panelists from aerospace and machine-learning companies such as Boeing , PhysicsX , and Cohere discussed how the latest developments in AI were proving to be fast-paced disruptors—but were also providing fresh opportunities to create value. Over the next ten years, they said, more than $50 billion could be at stake in sustainable aviation ventures. “AI will be used to train pilots, provide better real time in-flight data and predict the booking patterns of customers so airlines can better manage resources,” said senior partner and coleader of McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice, Hugues Lavandier . “AI-assisted parametric design will also change the jobs of engineers. We will need to adapt to new skillsets.” Sustainable and inclusive growth in the aerospace sector was a prevalent topic throughout the show, and McKinsey also hosted a lively panel discussion on how to economically implement sustainable aviation efforts. Leaders from Boeing, Airbus , Lufthansa , Heathrow Airport , and BP Aero took note of the fact that the aviation industry has committed to achieving net-zero flying by 2050 . This commitment becomes even more relevant when considering that approximately 25 airlines—which represent more than 30 percent of global air passenger traffic—have already committed to the Science Based Target initiative to attain net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 . We need to keep up progress on developing sustainable aviation fuels and more efficient aircraft designs, while investing in novel propulsion systems. “Aviation contributes between two and four percent of global CO 2 emissions,” said Robin Riedel , partner and leader of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility . “It’s a meaningful industry that we need to decarbonize. We need to keep up progress on developing sustainable aviation fuels and more efficient aircraft designs while also investing in novel propulsion systems using hydrogen or electric-battery systems. These might be longer-term solutions, but we are going to need them.” Future air mobility could help contribute to aviation sustainability initiatives. Investment in the fledgling industry remains strong: in 2022, investors reached $3 billion in funding for FAM projects, and with approximately 6,700 orders, the overall investments represented $45 billion in value . Many companies have advanced from early stage mock-ups to more tangible prototypes and manufacturing facilities. McKinsey hosted interviews with entrepreneurs leading the way, including Klaus Roewe, CEO of Lilium , an air mobility company; Adam Goldstein, founder and CEO of aircraft developer Archer Aviation ; and André Stein, co-CEO of Eve Air Mobility , which specializes in electrical take-off and landing aircraft. Although the future of the aerospace and aviation industry is brimming with innovation and technological advancement opportunities, there was one topic widely noted as a challenge: a looming talent gap. This is especially true in the software space, as our research has addressed . “We had a significant loss of talent because of the decline in the aviation industry during COVID-19, particularly in manufacturing and engineering jobs,” said senior partner and coleader of McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice, Varun Marya . “We also have a lack of senior engineers in the pipeline, so we’re facing a talent deficit just as the industry is going through an upswing. We are feeling those shortages.” There was, however, optimism that many of the challenges the sector is facing—especially developing sustainable aviation—are exciting, attractive options for people beginning their careers. “When I speak to younger people who have joined the industry, they are very excited about trying to solve sustainability challenges,” noted Varun Marya. “It could be a distinct advantage in attracting talent.” related McKinsey’s new Sustainability Academy helps clients upskill workers for the net-zero transition Never miss a story"
"Meet Lilli, our generative AI tool that&rsquo;s a researcher, a time saver, and an inspiration","McKinsey&rsquo;s new generative AI tool can scan thousands of documents in seconds, delivering the best of our firm&rsquo;s knowledge to our clients.",2023-08-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/meet%20lilli%20our%20generative%20ai%20tool/lilli-hero_1273006589_1536x864.jpg,AI & Analytics,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-lilli-our-generative-ai-tool,"Meet Lilli, our generative AI tool that’s a researcher, a time saver, and an inspiration August 16, 2023 In a recent McKinsey report, “The economic potential of generative AI,” our experts describe how over the decades, technology has given people “superpowers,” or abilities that go beyond human limitations. Here at McKinsey, we’ve been exploring how generative AI might give our people such abilities, and we’re pleased to announce that we have now launched “Lilli,” our own generative AI solution for colleagues. It’s a platform that provides a streamlined, impartial search and synthesis of the firm’s vast stores of knowledge to bring our best insights, quickly and efficiently, to clients. “Lilli aggregates our knowledge and capabilities in one place for the first time and will allow us to spend more time with clients activating those insights and recommendations and maximizing the value we can create,” says Erik Roth , a senior partner with McKinsey who leads our firm’s development of Lilli and integrating Gen AI technologies into the way we work. “An engagement team will be able to spend more time on problem solving, coaching, building capabilities, and helping clients achieve the performance they aspire to achieve.” “Knowledge is the lifeforce of McKinsey,” explains Kitti Lakner , an associate partner and director of design for Lilli. “When we started as a firm almost 100 years ago, our knowledge was with our experts. Over the years, our experts have used it to develop playbooks, case studies, and white papers that eventually became data, digital solutions, and analytics tools such as Wave , Corporate Performance Analytics (CPA), and Periscope. ” Creating value beyond the hype Today, our firm’s intellectual property (IP) spans more than 40 carefully curated knowledge sources; there will be more than 100,000 documents and interview transcripts containing both internal and third-party content, and a network of experts across 70 countries. When an engagement kicks off, creating the initial project plan is an important first step. This includes searching for the most salient research documents and identifying the right experts, which can be an overwhelming task for people who are new to our firm. Even for senior colleagues, the work typically takes two weeks of researching and networking. This is where AI “superpowers” come in. “With Lilli, we can use technology to access and leverage our entire body of knowledge and assets to drive new levels of productivity. This is the first of many use cases that will help us reshape our firm,” explains Jacky Wright , a McKinsey senior partner and chief technology and platform officer. For Adi Pradhan , an associate partner who specializes in technology strategy and transformations, Lilli is “a thought-sparring partner” ahead of meetings and presentations. “I use Lilli to look for weaknesses in our argument and anticipate questions that may arise,” he says. “I also use it to tutor myself on new topics and make connections between different areas on my projects. It saves up to 20 percent of my time preparing for meetings, but more importantly, it improves the quality of my expertise and my contributions.” Josh Sternberg , a McKinsey partner in our Life Sciences Practice, uses Lilli to answer one of the most frequently asked questions from clients: What can we learn from someone who’s done this before? “I was looking for an example of a company that manufactures a product in a very precise way,” he recalls. “Ordinarily, I would have been thinking of other pharmaceutical examples or say, manufacturers of jet engines. Lilli came up with the example of a device used to measure paint thickness, which was unexpected but very apt.” Generative AI: Capturing the opportunity Before Lilli, “identifying analogues” or “comparables” could take days of chasing down the right experts. Lilli not only widens the scope of these critical initial inquiries, but also returns answers much more quickly. “The productivity gains of Lilli are very interesting, but the ability to inspire new ways of looking at problems and answering questions is invaluable,” Sternberg points out. So how does Lilli work? A user can type in a question and Lilli can scan our entire landscape of knowledge, identify between five to seven of most relevant pieces of content, summarize key points, include links, and even identify experts in the appropriate fields. The platform includes two modes: one for searching McKinsey's reserves of knowledge, and a second option for external sources. The platform is named for Lillian Dombrowski, the first professional woman hired by McKinsey in 1945, who went on to become the controller and corporate secretary for the firm. Those who knew Lillian said she was up for anything; her research led to the creation of our transportation and insurance sectors; she helped create profit-sharing and pension plans, and even started our firm’s archives. “Lilli” was selected because the platform is as nimble, flexible, and thorough as she was. Lilli has unleashed the creative potential in our people. They are helping clients in ways we never anticipated. Lilli was carefully designed to meet McKinsey’s technology standards using industry-leading platforms, and piloted with real users—both consultants and internal clients. “In a sense, the technology was the easy part,” says Phil Hudelson , a McKinsey partner who leads the development of our technology platforms. “The biggest challenge was to move quickly while bringing the right people to the table from functions such as legal, cyber security, risk management, and talent development to ensure that we addressed all angles so that we could make this work throughout the firm.” The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier The initial team of three expanded to over 70 experts. With QuantumBlack 's deep experience in GenAI, including our QB Horizon suite and an ecosystem of partners, we're able to scale Lilli in a cost-effective, secure manner across thousands of colleagues by the end of the year. The effort will include upskilling users on prompt engineering, content validation, and more. We are sharing “lessons learned” through a playbook, and helping clients build their own versions of Lilli. As an organization that develops expertise, McKinsey had the advantage of already having hundreds of people in place around the world who serve as “data stewards”: curating content, ensuring the accuracy and quality of data, sanitizing it for client confidentiality, and making it searchable and shareable across formats. “Now we need to supercharge this capability—but at least we have the muscle to think about that in the first place,” points out Phil. “Lilli has unleashed the creative potential in our people: they are helping clients in ways we never anticipated.” Now that is a true superpower. related McKinsey and Cohere collaborate to transform clients with enterprise generative AI McKinsey launches new product suite to help clients scale AI Never miss a story"

McKinsey’s approach to client work is aligned with our theory of change; when we lift companies up, opportunities arise for those who need them most and innovative solutions flourish. Hear from our partners on how McKinsey works to achieve growth that is both sustainable and inclusive. The past was always about tradeoffs; it was a zero-sum game. The mindsets and behaviors need to change to make and sustain a shift. Gemma D’Auria: Clients always want to talk about growth, but now the impact they want is holistic—not just for shareholders—but for customers, the communities they are part of, and society at large. What we’ve found is that companies aren’t always holistically planning for internal changes. We encourage companies to bring different parts of the organization together that aren’t used to ‘talking’ to one another, to think about sustainability, inclusion, and growth in problem solving. Kweilin Ellingrud : An experience that showed me the power of sustainable and inclusive growth was a multiyear transformation we did for a global wealth and asset manager. The organization was struggling because of a customer-facing backlog. It was growing quickly, but that growth was not sustainable. For every unit of growth that we drive, how do we ensure it is more sustainable and more inclusive? We went in and completely redesigned its end-to-end journeys. We eliminated the backlog by empowering employees who were closest to the work to problem solve and by working systematically across teams. Ultimately, the transformation quickly helped the company sustainably achieve the levels of growth it aspired to—and, it served more lower-income customers than many of its competitors. And along the way, the company took care of its employees. It helped them build careers and skills while getting promoted and getting higher pay over time. Shelley Stewart III: When I see efforts at sustainable inclusive growth that don’t gain traction, it’s often because they get delegated and moved off the plate of senior leaders. This type of growth needs to be a core value in the business model, not something separate and handled through philanthropy. Taking a step back and saying, “How do I build this into my core business model? How can I get creative about the cost structure to make that work?” That’s when you start to see things succeed. Providing capital for the energy transition and investing in the development of people in underserved communities—these are commercial opportunities. Many companies get stuck in inertia. Often, if you're a retailer, you have an optimization model that tells you where to put the next location. It's informed by your existing footprint—and that’s going to keep your stores out of communities that are underserved. It’s important to remember that partnerships with the public and not-for-profit sectors can make a big difference on these types of issues that affect business growth. In some of these cases you need a longer-term view of profitability, so not a next quarter or next half of the year, but in a three- and five-year view, this operating model will pay off economically. It can’t be the status quo anymore. Never miss a story"
An inside look at how businesses are—or are not—managing AI risk,Two authors of our State of AI in 2023 survey discuss the astounding rise—and risks—of using generative AI across organizations.,2023-08-31T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/an%20inside%20look%20at%20how%20businesses%20are%20or%20not%20managing%20ai%20risk/responsible-ai-blog-hero_1406027727_1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Resilience",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/an-inside-look-at-how-businesses-are-or-not-managing-ai-risk,"An inside look at how businesses are—or are not—managing AI risk August 31, 2023 In the past eight months, the growth of generative AI capabilities has been dazzling, elevating AI from the domain of tech teams to the top of CEO agendas. More than two-thirds of companies are expecting to increase their AI investment over the next three years. But like any significant technological advancement, generative AI brings with it new risks, and it can also exacerbate existing risks. In our newest research, The state of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s breakout year , only 32 percent of respondents say they’re taking measures to prevent inaccuracy, while 38 percent, down from 51 percent last year, are managing cybersecurity risks. To learn more, we caught up with Liz Grennan , an expert associate partner who leads our work in digital trust worldwide, and Bryce Hall , an associate partner and co-author of the report. The explosive growth of generative AI tools was clearly the headline from this survey. What else are we seeing? Bryce: Businesses are recognizing that the newer generative AI tools have crossed a threshold from “ shiny new object ” to demonstrating commercial viability and creating value across various business domains. Part two of the story is that there ’ s broad recognition—and heightened concern—about the risks. Many existed before with traditional types of AI—privacy, equity, anti-bias, and explainability. But now there is increased awareness of other risks that are particularly salient with generative AI tools: accuracy, IP protections and attribution, cybersecurity, and others. One of the most colorful analogies I heard about generative AI was: “We've just opened Jurassic Park, but we haven’t yet installed the electric fences.” How has the landscape of AI risk management changed? Liz: To Bryce’s point, with the speed and advancements in technology, we don’t even know yet what type of electric fence to put into place. One of the hard things is the rise and scale and speed of malicious use. “There will be a lot of tears” is how one law firm partner characterized situations where companies have delayed risk management—whether due to complexity, procrastination, or lack of perceived need. What’s different now is that we are seeing a lot of case studies about reputational damage, customer attrition, and erosion of market value, along with increased fines and regulatory scrutiny. One of the biggest changes over the past few years is the concept of personal liability for senior executives and board members for oversight failures.  Leaders must maintain a good understanding of innovation being launched in their organizations, especially if its output impacts their customers. How have companies been responding to these increasing challenges? Bryce: We’ve seen some organizations take a little bit of a “head in the sand” approach, for example, with banning the use of generative AI in their organizations. Others have taken a wait-and-see attitude, watching as some explore the frontier, seeing how that plays out, and then adopting a fast-follower strategy. Leading companies are doing a few things. Typically, in the development of an AI solution, we would have a pod that would include data scientists, data engineers, UX/UI designers, and business leads. But now legal and cyber risk experts are also being looped in at the start. Second, in leading companies adopting generative AI, chief risk officers are playing an even more critical role in the C-suite. The third thing is a clear, structured approach for developing and then rolling out new applications to beta users or “red teams,” to really test the guardrails and identify where strong parameters need to be put in place. What best practices are we seeing from the leaders? Liz: What distinguishes the leaders is that AI is not treated as a one-off spoke, as opposed to their legacy business; it is in the core of everything they do, and so you need risk management and controls embedded in every aspect as well. It must be foundational. We will steward your data well, managing it from a risk perspective that includes privacy, security, confidentiality. Organizations shouldn’t be building from scratch. The way I think of it is around “train tracks” that organizations have built to handle, for instance, privacy, security, and basic data governance. By train tracks, I mean the people, processes, and technology that span across the organization to manage risk. They will have to load their AI risk controls onto these tracks and upskill their people to manage it. And because the technologies are changing so fast, the risk controls themselves will have to be continually updated. So vendors are bringing the best they have to market—with monitoring and feedback loops built in—knowing its going to be changing quickly.  Companies are using agile methods, not just for quick triage, but for iterating their risk controls and responding as scope and features change. The risk controls have to keep up, as do the teams that apply them. McKinsey has recently published 10 Responsible AI Principles. How else are we serving clients in this space? Liz: Yes, as a leader, we want to be clear with our clients that we take AI and data stewardship very seriously. We are values driven and this includes how we approach data, so we are saying in effect: “We will steward your data well, managing it from a risk perspective that includes privacy, security, confidentiality.” We want to also share these principles with the world at large, as guidance to help in setting standards for protecting society. In turn, we are helping our clients develop their own approaches to responsible AI and data use. We design environments for the new agile risk management. And we counsel control functions to “shift left,” or move testing and performance evaluation earlier in the process, while remaining efficient. Every client is at a different stage of this journey, so we tailor our approaches to where they are, always mapping to a business’s strategic objectives—and to creating value. Bryce: To build on Liz’s comment, our ability to help clients develop their own approaches to implementing responsible AI is a differentiator for us. Two years ago, for example, everyone was saying explainability was essential. Now, we realize that isn’t always possible at a detailed level with foundational models. What is possible is a focus on quality: quality of the inputs and the accuracy and fairness of the outputs. Responsible AI (RAI) Principles What changes should organizations be anticipating in AI risk management over the next six months? Liz: We will see steps toward the formalizing of some global standards. The White House right now has voluntary AI governance measures for safety, security, and trust to which they’re asking people to subscribe. The EU AI Act may be in effect by early 2025, spurring a range of compliance programs that will then be required by law. There’s wisdom in orienting around what’s coming there—similar to the GDPR journey—that really established privacy programs worldwide. Over the next year, I think the societal and organizational value of AI will increase. In fact, in related research in the US, we found that consumers are now considering the trust aspect of a product and service almost as important as price and delivery time. This was astounding to me, with significant implications. The stage will be very crowded with both virtue and vice. One of next year’s tech trends could be the use of AI to combat the harms of AI because we can’t solve this with traditional means. It may take the power, size, and scale of AI to counter these adverse effects. related Three experts offer an inside look at the state of AI Meet Lilli, our generative AI tool that’s a researcher, a time saver, and an inspiration Never miss a story"

The carbon fee, in effect since January 1, 2023, will fund the firm’s decarbonization efforts and be invested in green technologies such as carbon removals and sustainable aviation fuels. Even as McKinsey continues to be committed to new ways of working, spending time on-site with clients remains central to the firm’s ability to deliver impact. The carbon fee adds transparency and accountability to travel decisions and, by funding investments to accelerate the global transition, supports the firm’s aspiration to be the largest private-sector catalyst for decarbonization. The carbon fee applies to all internal and client-related air travel, which represent more than 80 percent of the firm’s overall carbon footprint. This initiative follows other major sustainability investments by the firm. Last year, McKinsey co-founded Frontier , a billion dollar advance market commitment to spur future demand for permanent carbon removal technologies. McKinsey has compensated for all its emissions since 2018, has committed to achieving net-zero climate impact by 2030, and has set validated, near-term, science-based targets for 2025. McKinsey aims to reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by 30 percent p.c. (vs. 2019) by 2025. Through its client service, McKinsey is working to speed the transition in all sectors, including clients in hard-to-abate industries like energy, aviation, manufacturing, shipping, and logistics.

This collaboration will bring together Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) technologies, including Einstein and Data Cloud , with McKinsey’s proprietary AI and data models, assets, and capability building power. McKinsey and Salesforce will help companies bring together relevant structured and unstructured data to improve customer buying experiences, increase sales productivity, personalize digital marketing campaigns and reduce call resolution time. Lareina Yee, Senior Partner, McKinsey & Company said: “Generative AI is a powerful catalyst for growth. But the promise of AI needs to be backed by built-for-growth technology and the operational muscle to fully realize the potential. Building on our strong alliance, we are collaborating with Salesforce on this critical front to bring our proprietary AI assets, data models and tech build/design capabilities to help our clients turn innovation into impact– all delivered together in Salesforce workflows.” Generative AI: Capturing the opportunity Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, said: “In today’s business landscape, adopting an AI-first approach rooted in trust and transparency isn't a choice, but a necessity to succeed. Salesforce and McKinsey are coming together to empower every company with the strategies and technologies needed to fully leverage generative AI across their organization to engage with customers in personalized ways, unlock new opportunities and achieve growth.” The era of generative AI is pushing the productivity frontier for economies and companies across all industry sectors, and especially marketing and sales. Recent McKinsey research estimates that generative AI has the potential to unlock $4.4 trillion global productivity over the next decades and has the potential to drive a 5-15 percent increase in total marketing spending and a 3-5 percent surge in sales productivity. McKinsey’s research also shows that 40 percent of enterprises plan to invest in generative AI. This collaboration will help companies realize measurable results by deploying Salesforce and McKinsey software, data assets and an implementation methodology that focuses on building generative AI solutions that work at scale. Salesforce and McKinsey’s collaboration creates a new end-to-end experience for companies that links a company’s business strategy to AI use cases. This is followed by McKinsey’s rapid solution design with a proof of concept, MVP build and the ability to test solutions with users to connect AI products and people systems for full scale roll out. Our joint team of data scientists, solution architects, cloud engineers, UX designers and organization culture specialists will work side by side with company teams. McKinsey and Salesforce know that companies want to move fast and that some prefer the flexibility of BYOL (“bring your own LLM”). Companies want to ensure tech investments deliver a measurable ROI and want simplicity - a platform to see relevant data, an easy way to ask questions and insightful data summaries and information to work faster and smarter. Together, Salesforce and McKinsey can help companies keep pace with the speed of market innovation and their own performance expectations. McKinsey and Salesforce share a history of collaboration helping organizations accelerate digital transformations. This collaboration followed McKinsey’s 2022 acquisition of Salesforce Platinum Partner S4G Consulting and builds on McKinsey’s recent acquisitions enhancing its AI stack under QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey through Cloud provider, Candid, and scaling AI and Machine Learning Operations specialist Iguazio. This powerful combination allows McKinsey to bring together the strengths of its Salesforce experts, AI, and tech to help clients move from strategy all the way through implementation and impact. related An inside look at how businesses are—or are not—managing AI risk McKinsey launches new product suite to help clients scale AI Meet Lilli, our generative AI tool that’s a researcher, a time saver, and an inspiration McKinsey and Salesforce forge new alliance to help organizations accelerate digital transformations Never miss a story"
Partner Voices: The limitless possibilities of inclusion,Inclusion is integral to economic growth because it creates meaningful opportunities for underserved and overlooked populations to contribute to and thrive in the economy.,2023-09-07T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/partner%20voices%20the%20limitless%20possibilities%20of%20inclusion/partner-voices-the-limitless-possibilities-of-inclusion-hero-1536.jpg,Inclusive Growth,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/partner-voices-the-limitless-possibilities-of-inclusion,"Partner Voices: The limitless possibilities of inclusion September 7, 2023 As we work to accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth, we’ve seen the benefits to companies and communities of economic inclusion . To grow, companies need to be inclusive in their approach to talent so they can find new workers that offer diverse skills and perspectives. This also expands a company’s business into  more communities—including those historically underserved and undervalued. McKinsey partners below offer their insight into how inclusion has played a key role in their client work—from the retail industry to the public sector and across the Middle East and Africa—and will in the future. Our conversation with the CEO was very clear, bold ambitions require diverse profiles in your C-suite and in your organization. The company had never had a female executive, and now they do. Mustafa: If you look at the countries that comprise the Middle East, there is such a young population that needs to be absorbed into the workforce. At the same time, we’re seeing unprecedented ambition from companies to grow, so there’s no choice but growth for the Middle East. We need to be as inclusive as we can of the diverse young population to maximize the workforce and youth opportunity. But how do you train them and skill them at scale? This is part and parcel of what we do at the firm. In the past, we were mostly a strategy firm, but now half of what we do is execution. We are there with companies helping them build capabilities for new employees so they can serve more communities and create more opportunities. Retail is where consumers spend much of their hard-earned dollars. And the products consumers purchase can be indicative of what and who they support. We’ve seen consumers voting for diversity with their wallets…and want to do it more. Tiffany: The frontline of retail is full of opportunity to further diversity goals. The products retailers assort on their shelves matter, and McKinsey studies show that roughly 45 percent of consumers believe that retailers should further support Black owned brands on their shelves—indicative of the real and measurable demand for diverse owned brands. Accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth But it doesn’t stop at product, it’s also about the people—the customers that the product and shopping experience attracts as well as the frontline employees.  The retail frontline is more diverse than ever before, and it’s also changing rapidly with 44 percent of frontline workers considering leaving their job in the next 3-6 months. This turnover on the frontline is not only costly (estimated at over $10,000 per employee), but it’s also a missed opportunity when retailers lose diverse talent. With these dynamics, it’s incumbent upon retailers to think deeply on how they’re building the complexion of the company from the frontlines: the production of the shelves, the customers being encouraged to shop, and the frontline employee—and to act accordingly. Inclusion really starts with making sure someone has a job. From there, so much is possible. Acha: Growth is oxygen and it's something we need. In Africa, we've had strong economic growth in the past 20-30 years. But at the same time the number of people living in poverty has gone up, not down. My public sector clients on the continent very much understand the need for this growth to be much more sustainable and much more inclusive, but how do we get there? What we found is that the sectors that drive growth tend to be different from those that drive jobs. If you work on the resources sector or some of the manufacturing sectors, these are amazing for growth, but in general don't create many jobs. Sectors that drive jobs tend to be agriculture, retail, and wholesale trade. We’ve focused on how to transform these sectors, create jobs, so we can drive growth and drive inclusion. It’s all possible—if it’s done right. related Partner voices: Growth isn’t a zero-sum game Never miss a story"

Our portfolio brings together the deep expertise of S4G, a Salesforce Platinum Partner that we acquired last year , with our AI insights powered by QuantumBlack, capability building, and agile principles to help companies optimize their Salesforce environments and grow their customer and partner relationships. We recently spoke to Steve Reis and Jan-Christoph Köstring ,  McKinsey senior partners, about how Growth Tech on Salesforce is creating greater value for organizations. How has the S4G acquisition changed the way we serve our clients? Steve: With S4G, we have been able to expand the boundary of our client service and can now directly operate in our clients’ marketing and sales tech stack, in this case, Salesforce, which dominates the global CRM market. About 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use it to manage their business relationships. But research indicates that 50 percent of leaders believe that their Salesforce implementations are failing to deliver full expected results. Many times, the applications are in place, but they’re sub-optimized. Or a piece is missing. Or the technology needs to be upgraded to support a company’s new growth strategy. There is a huge need to help businesses gain more value from their Salesforce investments which is why we’re introducing Growth Tech on Salesforce. Technology is an increasingly bigger part of every client relationship we have. Steve: Yes, when we’re working with a client to achieve a transformation, we ultimately need hundreds, often times, thousands of people around the globe to change what they're doing on a daily basis. For years, this has been done through change management, training, and reinforcement on the spot. But this is labor intensive, often can only be done for a limited time each day, and it can sometimes take weeks and months to see results. Technology is changing all of this. For the last three years, our firm has invested deeply in building our tech capabilities so that we can innovate the way we serve clients, specifically “tech-enabling” them to achieve transformations in faster and more lasting ways. Ever-changing customer behavior requires a new approach that focuses on customer-centricity and providing value — anytime, anywhere. That’s why the status quo has shifted decisively toward greater investments in built-for-growth technology. When we can improve the quality of insights it produces, shape how it presents information and triggers desired behaviors, and cascade this across an organization, it is a much more powerful way to help a company reinforce desired mindsets, behaviors, and outcomes. Growth Tech on Salesforce We are launching Growth Tech on Salesforce into a highly competitive, billion-dollar ecosystem of advisory services. What makes our solutions unique? Jan-Christoph :  It is the fact that we can offer clients end-to-end solutions. We can design and build a completely new Salesforce environment that integrates our cutting-edge Growth Marketing & Sales solutions;  implement a single solution leveraging AI for superior cross- and upselling; or optimize an existing system using one of our proprietary diagnostics to maximize returns. We go from setting strategy at the highest level all the way to implementing and integrating it. Most other companies specialize on the left side of the equation, so to speak, in concepts, methods or tools; or on the right side, handling only the execution or implementation. We serve as an end-to-end growth partner for our clients. To do this, we have significantly expanded our client service offerings to help scale sales and marketing transformations. From strategy, design, and implementation to capability building and operations, we simplify the complex in technology with high-precision data that brings more personalized value to every customer interaction. What does a typical project look like? Jan-Christoph: We start with a C-suite strategy on driving above-market growth based on tech-enablement, and then build and directly implement end-to-end use cases such as lead management, pricing, cross-selling, and others directly into the Salesforce system, allowing us to immediately scale the impact by providing our solutions to every sales rep at any time.  Specifically, we use AI and analytics to generate the insights that inform every aspect of the CRM process. This includes improving users’ productivity, personalizing messaging to customers, optimizing pricing, and highlighting sales opportunities. At every point, we are focused on identifying what will create the greatest value for the client, and we use that lens to make decisions and tradeoffs and sidestep the pitfalls of other implementations. We have seen uplifts of 10-20% in sales or more than 20% in productivity gains. What has surprised you most over this past year of building this portfolio? Steve: There has been a lot of frustration among C-suite executives who do not come from a technology background, feeling that teams are talking past each other; experiencing issues, missing deadlines. What has amazed me the most is the ability of our S4G leaders to cut through that and spend several days, maybe a week, just looking at the data systems and the way the technology's been deployed—the code, the workflows, how the client teams are connecting—and come back with a succinct perspective on the specific issues that need to change—that resonates with both sides of the debate, the C-suite and the tech teams. That is a rare skill that is increasingly important. related McKinsey Sciences for Growth launches to help companies drive tech-enabled growth Never miss a story"
A new way to support clients through the energy transition,"Energy Solutions by McKinsey, a team of data scientists and analysts, uses leading global energy intelligence and market insights to help clients make strategic, tactical, and operational decisions.",2023-09-14T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20launches%20new%20initiative%20to%20support%20clients%20through%20the%20energy%20transition/mckinsey-blog-imagery-energysolutions-1536x864px.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/supporting-clients-through-the-energy-transition,"A new way to support clients through the energy transition September 14, 2023 The renewable energy transition is now well under way. According to McKinsey’s “Global Energy Perspective 2022” report, electric power, synthetic fuels, and hydrogen will represent 32 percent of the global energy mix by 2035 and 50 percent by 2050. The energy sector has never been in a greater state of flux, as companies move to adapt to lower carbon expectations and a disrupted market landscape. Household name oil and gas producers have been building up renewable energy businesses , green energy companies have been scaling up, and sustainability-focused start-ups have emerged to provide innovative services in a fast-evolving transition to  clean, renewable energy sources. It is within this changing landscape that we introduce Energy Solutions by McKinsey , a team of data scientists and analysts whose leading global energy intelligence and market insights will help energy-sector organizations make well-informed strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. With a focus on helping clients capture opportunities, manage risk, and improve performance, Energy Solutions brings together teams from our Electric Power & Natural Gas and Oil & Gas Practices, combining our knowledge to serve clients across the energy value chain. Below, three Energy Solutions leaders talk about how the needs of clients are changing, why a new team approach was required to meet today’s challenges, and what the future looks like for the global energy transition. David Helstrom, partner, Houston Countries around the world are trying to solve the energy “trilemma”: making sure energy is accessible, affordable, and sustainable. Over the past several years, we’ve witnessed how challenging it can be to navigate the right path to solve this issue. It requires new ways of thinking, and companies throughout the global energy ecosystem are evolving rapidly to achieve this. Power companies are ramping up investments in renewables, and oil and gas companies are re-evaluating portfolios, with many standing up independent renewable energy and low-carbon businesses in industries such as hydrogen and other sustainable fuels. Additionally, start-ups and businesses focused solely on  green energy continue to pursue new alternatives and carbon-capture technologies. As a result, the classic lines between power, oil, and gas sectors are blurring. Rather than keeping two different groups of experts focused on one sector or the other, McKinsey created Energy Solutions to form a single, fully integrated team to better serve our clients. These worlds are overlapping, and it gives us the opportunity to bring a consolidated set of market insights, models, and tools that span the entire energy spectrum. Needless to say, this is an exciting time to be working in the energy space. There is so much innovation and passion around this important topic, and we remain focused on helping our clients find opportunities that will solve this complicated equation. Luciano Di Fiori, partner, Houston Oil and gas companies recognize that we’re reaching peak demand for legacy fuels, so they have been exploring other opportunities through the energy transition. It turns out that these companies have essential expertise when it comes to the new technologies and processes. Take, for example, carbon capture and storage (CCS), which involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial activity, then compressing, transporting, and storing it deep underground. It’s essentially the opposite of what oil and gas companies have been doing for decades: extracting fossil fuel from the ground and transporting it through networks. These organizations have the key capabilities and infrastructure already in place for carbon capture. Similarly, these same companies also have deep experience with hydrogen—especially, those who operate refining complexes, as hydrogen is used in the refining process. It’s important to acknowledge that hydrocarbons will be part of our energy mix for at least the next 30 years. Whether we like it or not, the reality is that mankind will need hydrocarbons for our energy needs for many more decades. The challenge for us, then, is to help oil and gas clients decarbonize their activities, while also transitioning to other fuels, which allows for the continuation of supplying hydrocarbon-based fuels, but with far fewer emissions. It’s just as important that we support oil and gas companies on this journey. Jesus Rodriguez Gonzalez, partner, Madrid There has been more change in the power and electricity industries in the last ten years than in the previous 100 years before it. These used to be very static sectors, but have become much more dynamic, and the barriers to entry are much lower. That is particularly true of renewable energy and energy commercialization, and we have seen a boom of new independent companies providing power through solar and wind, in addition to many oil and gas companies boldly entering this market. We have been focused on accelerating this energy transition through our green business building capabilities and supporting established companies and new entrants alike in navigating this new landscape. With heightened competition, better customer services and efficient renewables projects are becoming key. We are also becoming a platform for change beyond the energy sector by working with industrial clients on decarbonization journeys. This requires green energy—but how do you plan for it and execute that strategy? It’s a very exciting time to be working in the power and gas sectors. We are involved in building some of the largest solar, wind, hydrogen, and biogas projects in the world. We are creating new champions of these technologies and helping current leaders shape their portfolios to the new reality. We are fortunate to be playing a role in truly changing the world. related To build a decarbonized future, McKinsey summit unites infrastructure leaders McKinsey Sustainability and Moody’s Analytics join forces to help banks build climate resilience Never miss a story"
McKinsey leaders herald new horizon of customer experience at Dreamforce 2023,"At Dreamforce 2023, McKinsey leaders from marketing, technology, and more offered a glimpse into the future of tech-powered growth.&nbsp;",2023-10-03T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/this%20is%20about%20making%20human%20lives%20better/dreamforce-hero-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-leaders-herald-new-horizon-of-customer-experience-at-dreamforce-2023,"McKinsey leaders herald new horizon of customer experience at Dreamforce 2023 McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels joined Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff for a fireside chat onstage at Dreamforce 2023. October 3, 2023 Dreamforce, the annual conference organized by Salesforce, is one of the biggest tech events of the year. With thousands of presentations, workshops and training sessions taking place in San Francisco over three days, the gathering sees leading thinkers and experts from across the Salesforce ecosystem offer their insights into the future of the tech industry. In this era of tech-powered growth, business leaders are expected to harness the power of tech and analytics – all enabled by generative AI to realize the full impact. McKinsey colleagues led and participated in a range of sessions at the event that explored important topics, from creating hyper-personalized experiences for customers to leveraging technology to drive sales productivity and accelerating the adoption of generative AI to improve ways of working. Our global managing partner Bob Sternfels sat down with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on day one to discuss the opportunities and challenges organizations face in this moment – including talent sourcing, the importance of personal renewal, and the future of AI. We caught up with a few members of our delegation on their key takeaways from this year’s event. Lareina Yee, Senior Partner I spend a lot of time unpacking the future of tech-powered growth with my colleague Steve Reis . We also talk about generative AI and its benefits to business, but what is it in service of? At the heart of this technology, it is about making human lives better. That is the whole promise of generative AI. On stage, I spoke with leaders of two very different businesses : Sarah Friar, CEO of Nextdoor, and Jean-André Rougeot, President and CEO of Sephora Americas. It was clear from them that if you’re thinking about this technology as an add-on, that’s not where you’re going to get value. The value is when you embed it into your strategy and leverage it to streamline operations, drive personalization, and more. I also spent the day with 40 CEOs delving further into generative AI. They were interested in how companies are executing against the promise of AI and valued the ability to exchange learnings together in the small group. These experiences reinforced for me that the companies who get generative AI right will have the potential to outgrow their peers by double digits. Jacky Wright, Senior Partner and Chief Technology Officer Generative AI is emerging as a virtual knowledge worker. For example, it can synthesize insights out of customer data or write sales scripts based on next-product-to-buy probabilities. The time saved can be invested in higher-quality activities and customer interactions. For most generative AI insights, a human must still interpret and oversee them, because the technology can fail at surprisingly simple tasks and invent convincing-sounding, but completely incorrect, responses. As Microsoft’s Peter Lee has said, “it is at once both smarter and dumber than any person you’ve ever met.” This technology has the potential to change the anatomy of work and improve productivity, but it’s vital that a human is involved. Jan-Christoph Köstring, Senior Partner Driving above-market growth is on the minds of business leaders across all sectors and industries, yet achieving this has proven difficult for many (only one in four companies have succeeded). However, there is a group of companies that have realized ambitious growth targets year over year. We call them the Growth Champions. They have cracked the code, so we explored their secret sauce and identified the key traits that are shared by these companies. One clear pattern across all of them is that they fully embraced the opportunity of tech-enabled growth. They make their marketing and sales tech stack (in 80 percent of cases this is Salesforce), the backbone of their growth activities. Building on this technology backbone, they innovate their marketing and sales approach: it starts with hyper-personalization, moving from outdated segmentation thinking to 1:1 relationships at scale. Consumers expect this and will go to another brand if they don’t get it. My colleagues Steve Reis and I recently shared insights on solutions that can deliver the hyper-personalization consumers are hungry for. In order to make this happen, Growth Champions activate their analytics and move them from nice-to-have to center stage, integrating them into the daily doing of their sales organization and supporting the automatization of sales activities. Obviously, accelerating growth through technology and analytics also requires different capabilities. Growth Champions have started to unite their business and IT teams to jointly develop the tech-enabled growth strategy. Tracy Francis, Senior Partner and Chief Marketing Officer The retail sector has experienced as much disruption in the past five years as the previous 25. The environment is still challenging, as we experience global inflation at its highest since the 1970s, consumer sentiment at record lows, and ongoing supply chain issues and labor imbalances. New trends have emerged. Consumers now use a spectrum of different channels to make purchases, have less brand loyalty, and higher expectations. The whole retail ecosystem is changing, including the relationship between retailers and suppliers. The workforce is also changing, with many planning to leave. This requires retailers to offer more flexibility, and to rethink their retention and promotion models. What are the most pressing priorities for consumer leaders today? Businesses need to become omnipotent on omnichannel: consumers will choose retailers based on ease and richness of end-to-end experience. Consumers also expect personalized experiences and offers, as well as accelerated delivery times. Finally, on ESG, consumers are now voting with their wallets for sustainability and broader purpose. Greg Kelly, Senior Partner Only seven percent of companies are delivering on the growth triple play by unifying creativity, analytics, and purpose. My colleagues Peter Dahlstrom, Brian Gregg, and I had the opportunity to facilitate a session with a group of chief revenue officers while at Dreamforce that explored what that 7 percent is doing right. The chief revenue officer role goes beyond traditional sales and marketing. They play a critical role driving growth of their businesses across the entire market landscape, working to delight their customers with a full range of products and solutions. These leaders were excited about the potential for built-for-growth technology, enabled by generative AI, to transform how they manage their sales and revenue streams. Salesforce’s own CRO Miguel Milano shared a behind-the-scenes look at how Salesforce uses its full range of solutions to drive and manage their revenue, and their own sales force. The CROs came away with a tangible understanding of how they can use technology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in their sales teams and simultaneously manage their revenue line with greater confidence.

Creating an &lsquo;ecosystem&rsquo; to close the Black talent gap in technology,The Black talent gap in technology has been stubbornly persistent and could worsen without action. McKinsey is helping to unite and transform efforts that can change course.,2023-10-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/creating%20an%20ecosystem%20to%20close%20the%20black%20talent%20gap%20in%20technology/blacktechtalentgap-hero-1534x836.jpg,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/creating-an-ecosystem-to-close-the-black-talent-gap-in-technology,"Creating an ‘ecosystem’ to close the Black talent gap in technology Participants at McKinsey's first Black Tech Summit October 5, 2023 As AI and other innovations drive the growth of new frontiers in technology, it’s imperative that a long-running effort stay center stage: racial equity. A recent report by McKinsey’s Digital practice and Institute for Black Economic Mobility detailed how efforts to close the Black talent gap in technology are falling short of necessary targets . Only 8 percent of employees in tech jobs and just 3 percent of technology executives in the C-suite are Black, putting billions of dollars in income at risk for Black workers and communities. This gap is likely to widen over the next decade, the McKinsey research found. Across all industries, technology jobs—those in data science, engineering, cybersecurity, and software development—are expected to grow 14 percent by 2032. Black tech talent in those roles is expected to grow only 8 percent over the same period. To help address this, McKinsey convened leaders across industries, in our first Black Tech Summit to catalyze action on education, recruitment, and retention initiatives. Below, we hear from some participants on how we can achieve parity in technology for Black professionals. Chris Perkins , associate partner, McKinsey Chris: Promoting diversity in tech is more nuanced than driving traditional diversity initiatives. This is primarily because of the specialized hard and soft skills required to enter tech-oriented professions and succeed throughout their careers. Our research shows us that various actors, such as nonprofits, for-profits, government agencies, and educational institutions are approaching the problem in small pockets. Could we help catalyze an ecosystem with wraparound support across sectors? To design this, we have to look at the full pipeline and its “leakage” points, from getting talent trained and in the door all the way up to the C-suite. These gaps are caused by lack of awareness and support in early childhood education through college, and lack of sponsorship and mentorship in early- and mid- career positions. While technical skills like software engineering are key, STEM majors are often not given the soft skills training needed to move up the ladder. These are often acquired and honed through informal mentor networks, which aren’t traditionally as available to Black talent. Employees with access to these networks tend to also have better understanding of the company’s business—also vital for advancement. We believe by bringing people together from a diverse set of roles and sectors, expanding recruitments pools to non-traditional sources, creating more mentors by educating communities—not just students—keeping skill building on track with tech innovation, and scaling what’s working, we can realize meaningful, lasting progress. McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility Andrea Juncos , director, Jobs for the Future’s Center for Racial Economic Equity Andrea: Jobs for the Future is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the US education and workforce systems to achieve equitable economic advancement for all. We’ve been conducting research on Black learners and workers in tech to better understand and disrupt labor market patterns that see under-representation of Black people in high wage, high growth jobs, but over-representation in lower wage jobs. We’re building a network of organizations working on this to increase the efficiency and impact of our collective efforts. Being at McKinsey’s Black Tech Summit was valuable for us to make connections with people from sectors we're not always in conversation with and to share insights from our work. Some of the key messages we offered were about recruitment and training. We work with community college systems based on their large concentration of Black learners and their potential as recruitment sources. We analyze data on the outcomes and experiences of Black learners and then design, implement, and evaluate solutions that can help them access high-value careers, such as tech. In addition, in our research , we analyzed over 200 organizations specifically focused on developing Black tech talent and identified top innovators. We shared the list at the event, and many were not familiar with the organizations. It was valuable exposure. There was discussion about what’s working, but beyond that, how do we scale? To move from replicating programs to having impact at scale requires systems-level approaches as well as comprehensive data. It’s clear there is more work to do in these areas, and the discussion helped us form important connections and begin shaping a path forward. Peter Akwaboah , chief operating officer for technology & global head of innovation, Morgan Stanley Peter: At Morgan Stanley, the commitment to diversity and inclusion is part of our core values, and it starts at the top with leading by example. Our Institute for Inclusion demonstrates how leaders across our firm are coming together in a shared mission to create a more equitable society and drive greater outcomes for underserved communities. Initiatives like this are important not just for an entire organization, but also for technology specifically as they can provide resources to help increase diversity within specialized skill sets like AI, cyber and cloud. To succeed, we must hold ourselves accountable. Senior leaders must be visible and representative of the communities we serve, and lead by example.  All leaders must engage with their people and provide access for mentoring and networking—but also be visible to students and prospective talent by supporting programs in the community like JumpStart and Year Up that provide early exposure to STEM careers. At the summit, we talked about ideas for more grassroots community outreach, including expanding our talent pools through targeted outreach in spaces at the heart of the community where we can explain the opportunities tech can offer. The summit not only fostered dialogue, but it formed its own community—one of people jointly trying to solve something that creates a more equitable society. related Partner Voices: The limitless possibilities of inclusion Never miss a story"
&lsquo;Spotlight&rsquo; on board diversity: McKinsey and Goldman Sachs move the needle,A joint program of the two companies has prepared dozens of diverse candidates for first-time board service&mdash;and made a major impact on diversifying boards in the US.,2023-10-09T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog,Diversity,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/spotlight-on-board-diversity,"‘Spotlight’ on board diversity: McKinsey and Goldman Sachs move the needle From left, Alice L. Jolla, chief accounting officer, Microsoft; Monica Turner, president, North America, Procter & Gamble; and Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief food and beverage officer, Target. October 9, 2023 Alice L. Jolla, chief accounting officer and corporate vice president at Microsoft, was deep into the interview process for an important step in her career: serving on a corporate board. The board representative told Jolla of an inclusive environment, but also shared a culture where board members stayed close to their areas of expertise and weren’t expected to offer other insights or opinions. “I thought, ‘this isn’t the right place for me,’” says Jolla. “I need to bring my full self and set of experiences.” Spotlight gave me the tools to succeed on a board, from picking the right one to hitting the ground running, it helped me understand what was possible Jolla felt confident in her decision. Knowing what was at stake, she had gone in to be interviewed—and to interview—to assess the fit. Today, she serves on the board of Rockwell Automation, a company that combines her experience in technology, manufacturing, and finance—and is a cultural fit. She credits this match to her participation in Spotlight, a joint program of McKinsey and Goldman Sachs that prepares candidates to serve on their first corporate board, particularly relevant to candidates from groups historically underrepresented on corporate boards. “Spotlight gave me the tools to succeed on a board, from selecting the right one to hitting the ground running. It helped me understand what was possible,” Jolla says. The six-month program has had four cohorts, each with 20-25 participants. The program’s high placement rate—over 70 percent for the first two cohorts—is a clear driver of the overall uptick in diverse first-time board members. In 2021, 159 individuals were first-time corporate directors in S&P 500 companies, with 86 percent from historically underrepresented groups. Turning words into action, together In 2020, Goldman Sachs announced that it would not take a company public in the US or Western Europe unless it had one diverse board member, expanding the requirement in 2021 to two, including one woman. “It's one thing to put out a policy and point to a problem, it's another to be part of the solution,” says Ilana Wolfe , head of corporate board engagement at Goldman Sachs. “We decided to help our clients get there by suggesting exceptionally talented diverse candidates.” Wolfe approached McKinsey’s Celia Huber , a senior partner who leads the firm’s North American board services sector , about creating a program to incubate first-time board members. “There shouldn’t be a lack of candidates, and yet companies were telling us they were having trouble finding them,” says Huber. “Spotlight was an obvious next step to change this.” Board 101 and beyond Spotlight is unique because it is not a training program or a bootcamp. Wolfe says you “cannot teach someone the necessary strategic mindset.” The program helps to prepare and empower those already primed for success. The program’s Board 101 series is where candidates engage with board members with years of experience, executives new to board service, and former members of the program who are now on boards. This range of expertise resonated with Monica Turner , president, North America, Procter & Gamble, who now serves on the board of Allstate. “I can’t underscore enough the wealth of years and experience I was exposed to, seeing board service from different perspectives and vantage points,” says Turner. Something particularly valuable to her was learning not to rush in. “Spotlight enabled me to be more effective in the search stage and in the first year on a public board,” she says. “Experienced leaders guided us on how to carefully choose a company that will be natural fit, and how to make an immediate impact as a board member.” Beyond the speaker series, Spotlight offers individual coaching assistance in the placement process, refining one’s personal narrative, and a network that lasts far beyond the program. “This program has a holistic approach. It set me up for the success and personal growth I was looking for,” Turner says. Leaning into diversity Rick Gomez , executive vice president and chief food and beverage officer at Target, who is Latino and gay, had several aspirations on his list for a board—including not being the only diverse member. “Boards are under a lot of pressure now to diversify,” says Gomez. “But are they just checking a box, or do they believe in the power of diversity?” He now serves on the board of Wendy’s, where he says there is a “diverse network within the board.” “It’s key to find a board that truly values your diverse perspective as well as your qualifications,” he says. “Spotlight offered really good advice from other diverse board members on how they've navigated this.” Boards are gradually becoming more diverse , but it can be a frustratingly slow process. Seats tend to open only when someone retires, and the requirements for filling them can be very specific. Are boards just checking a box, or do they believe in the power of diversity? “If you look at boards as a whole, the change is slow, but if you look at filling open seats, the momentum for change is there,” says Huber. Part of what needs to change is the perception that there aren’t enough diverse candidates who can fill any given open seat. At Goldman, Wolfe has a robust list of diverse candidates with a broad range of qualifications to help with matchmaking. “We say, ‘here’s an incredible person outside your usual network that’s perfect for your needs, who happens to have a diverse profile,’ and companies often jump to add them to their list,” she says. It’s an opportunity that for now, is still needed. “Being a minority woman trying to break into what’s still very much a closed club, Spotlight opened the door,” Jolla says. “Other Black women reach out to me, asking questions assuming they can’t serve on a board. Now I can share my experience, and it’s a multiplier effect.” related “Show me that this is possible”: Inspiring the journey to achieve inclusion in the workforce Never miss a story"
Partner Voices: Sustainability at the heart of growth,"New technologies continue to put net-zero within reach for businesses. With the right implementation, sustainability can be the guiding force of growth.",2023-10-16T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/partner%20voices%20sustainability%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20growth/sustainability-at-the-heart-of-growth-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/partner-voices-sustainability-at-the-heart-of-growth,"Partner Voices: Sustainability at the heart of growth From left to right: senior partners Kate Smaje, Kevin Wei Wang, Dymfke Kuijpers, and Aditya Sanghvi. October 16, 2023 Companies in every sector are at the center of efforts to reduce global emissions. Yet as they look to reach bold net-zero commitments, they still must meet growth targets. To succeed in these twin efforts, they will need to deploy new technologies that can increase efficiency and reduce waste across the value chain while transitioning away from carbon emissions. These are substantial shifts. Organizational change management, business building optimization, and collaboration strategies will be key to a successful transition. Below, McKinsey partners discuss technology, growth, sustainability—and the future of business. Technology is the lifeblood of many of the solutions that will enable organizations to achieve their sustainability goals. Kate: We have so much of the clean technology that we need that will help us reach net-zero—it’s not an innovation problem. What we have is a scalability problem. What's it going to take to do green steel at a level that is scalable for companies? That is the kind of challenge that we love at McKinsey. We work with clients on building the business model that's going to make that technology wildly successful in the long term. This way, it becomes less about tech for tech's sake, and much more about bringing clean tech to a level where it really can solve some of these sustainability challenges. There’s also the green IT side of things. We’re using more and more compute power—and, of course, consuming more energy to do that. So how do companies rethink their approach to technology so green is at the heart? It may mean making very different decisions. It will look very different to choose technology for employee use from the perspective of reducing emissions as much as possible, as opposed to purely thinking about keeping costs down. I see and work with organizations unpacking this and taking new approaches to the classical IT team than they did in the past. It’s a new way of working but it is the way of the future. To make a big difference in climate action, we have to address real estate—it’s 40 percent of carbon emissions. Aditya: Buildings contribute such a large share of global emissions. The good news is that we can actually address a significant amount of those emissions with the technologies and economics we have today. Unlike many other sectors, we don’t need to wait for a research lab or other stakeholders to act. This creates an obligation and opportunity for building owners and tenants to start immediately and move quickly. But the challenge is there are so many buildings, they’re all different, and they lie at the intersection of a complex set of supply chains and stakeholders. How can we figure out the current state of all of these buildings without having to send an engineer into each one? How can we coordinate landlords, tenants, lenders, utilities, and the other players needed to make a building net zero? How can we rapidly scale the supply chains we need, in areas like heat pumps, green steel, and smart building systems? And how can we create millions of skilled jobs to get this all done? These are the types of challenges we’re excited to be part of solving. We’re creating industry-changing artificial intelligence capabilities to dramatically accelerate building decarbonization. We’re mobilizing industries and working with governments to upskill workforces. It’s exciting and makes us optimistic about our ability to address the decarbonization challenge. Growth by itself is not enough anymore. You have to drive down your footprint as you’re growing. Dymfke: If you want to truly drive organic growth outside of M&A, you need to think about: How do I create a mechanism that funds itself? And a mechanism that disproportionately depletes natural resources or has a negative impact on society just doesn't work in the long run. You do need to work on actual revenue growth, but thinking about sustainability unlocks opportunity in terms of new business building. If you’re a beverage company, reducing your carbon footprint per liter of beverage produced, improving your impact on water and therefore the watershed for the communities around you—you need to use new technologies to do this. Developing and implementing these creates new opportunities for other businesses streams to grow. This is important because sustainability without affordability and growth is also not an option. In today's inflationary environment, you need to take a good hard look at the materials you’re using to make your product—avoiding excess plastics—and at efficiency to make sure that the consumer gets what they need. Not only do these improve the ultimate experience for the consumer, but they also drives down your cost and your footprint. Sustainability is not only imperative for our time and for future-proof growth, it’s what needs to define a company’s identity in today’s market. Kevin: Ultimately sustainability is about using resources in a more efficient way throughout the value chain of a company. Technology allows us to measure the energy footprint, the operational waste in every step of the value chain. It also offers automation and tools to tighten the chain, reduce manual work and physical waste. Technology enables a systematic effort that changes a company. But implementing such fundamental changes across a company has to be done carefully. Because if you don't have strong organizational change management, even if the concepts and tools are in place, a company won’t succeed. All this great technology that can reduce waste and increase energy efficiency won’t meet its promise. This is where McKinsey thrives. We measure progress, foster leadership development and culture change, innovate through our technology practice, increase efficiency through our operational practice—and bring it together in our change management and transformation methodology. With all of these together, change comes naturally. related Partner Voices: The limitless possibilities of inclusion Partner voices: Growth isn’t a zero-sum game Never miss a story"
Inside a new blueprint for accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth,Two authors of our new MGI report discuss twin imperatives&mdash;alleviating poverty and reducing emissions to address climate change&mdash;and outline how growth can advance both.,2023-10-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20blueprint%20for%20higher%20living%20standards%20and%20a%20net%20zero%20world/mgi-sig-hero-1536x864px.jpg,"Inclusive Growth,Sustainability,McKinsey Global Institute",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-mgi-research-a-blueprint-for-higher-living-standards-and-a-net-zero-world,"Inside a new blueprint for accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth October 30, 2023 Leaders face two generational opportunities: getting to net-zero emissions and reducing global poverty. “This year, a number of them expressed their belief that we should not have to choose between fighting for the planet and fighting poverty,” says Anu Madgavkar , a McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) partner. “A similar conviction has underpinned our research.” In MGI's new report, From poverty to empowerment: raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth , the authors show how these urgent issues are interconnected, and detail how thoughtful growth can lead to both a better quality of life and a greener world. The research was presented at the B20 Summit in India and at meetings during the UN General Assembly Week in New York City. We recently talked to Anu and Mekala Krishnan , also an MGI  partner, both of whom led the research. What does it mean that growth, inclusion, and sustainability are interconnected as one ‘system’? Mekala: Simply put, it means that solving one of the problems in isolation risks hurting the others. Solving them together can help advance all three simultaneously, if managed well. For example, if we talk about increasing incomes, it allows people to buy a whole range of goods. They may buy their first vehicle, say a motor bike; move to a bigger apartment or home; gain access to things like education and health care; and maybe have less of an emissions footprint. But many aspects of their consumption actually could, if not well-managed, raise their overall emissions footprint. On the other hand, raising incomes also allows people to afford more expensive items, such as electric vehicles, that they may not be able to afford otherwise. If it is well-managed, we can actually reduce emissions, because we have the financial means to make some of the energy transition investments that we need to make. What can private and public sector leaders do to encourage the growth needed to advance these twin agendas? Anu: For the private sector, it is about increasing their investment in new technologies and reskilling workers to prepare them to move to new, higher paying jobs. For example, India and Indonesia upgraded their digital infrastructure, which gave rise to a whole range of industries: the telecom sector itself, a variety of financial services, and mobile retail and consumer services. As these industries grow, there are a host of upstream and downstream jobs that get created: people needed to sell and service these phones, the repair-and-reuse industry that spins off from people having these devices. These are all mid-skill jobs that represent a big lift for people who are otherwise in informal work and not plugged into a fast-growing sector. In the public sector, policymakers need to think about how to stimulate job creation and remove barriers to investments in new technologies. Sometimes there are procedural and regulatory bottlenecks with the way workers can get certified, trained, or skilled, or move from one occupation to another. We have been on the net-zero journey since 2020. How would you characterize progress to date? Mekala: We are out of the first phase of the transition, which was about demonstration, showing that we could get there, that we had line-of-sight on technologies. Now it’s about this next phase of what I would call “transformation.” We looked one-by-one at about 50 different technologies across twelve regions and compared net-zero technologies, like solar, wind, electric vehicles, with more traditional ones, like gas or coal power, and internal-combustion-engine-based vehicles. We identified $10-trillion worth of spending on green technologies and low-emission alternatives that could be economically viable and cost competitive to traditional high-emissions technologies now. Many of these are in the power and mobility sectors. Things are starting to move: we are see financial incentives accelerating innovation and tech ecosystems and supply chains forming around these new alternative technologies. Collectively, growth and innovation can bridge about 40 percent of the net-zero investment gaps out to 2030. And that’s encouraging when you think about the scale of transformation we’re talking about: in 30 years, rebuilding an entire energy and industrial infrastructure that took 200 years to create. From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth How does this research relate to McKinsey’s work with organizations in the public and private sectors? Mekala: It gives further evidence that leaders need to focus on accelerating growth that is both sustainable and inclusive, which is the core of the work our colleagues are doing with both the private and public sector. What was your favorite insight from this work? Anu: For years, the measure of living standards has been the extreme poverty line set at $2.15 a day. But in our research, we frame the concept of ‘economic empowerment’ and then developed it as a tool that can help with policy making. We start with the consumption level of $12 per person, per day as a global floor and minimal acceptable standard covering the basics of food, education, water and sanitation. Then through an analysis of local wage, cost-of-living, and other data, we translated this at the country level. For example, it is about $3 per capita in Afghanistan and Sudan; $8 to $11 in China, South Africa, and Thailand; $15 to $45 in Australia, Denmark, Japan. Economic empowerment still implies living in frugal circumstances. But it allows people to move from just surviving to feeling safe, secure, and motivated to participate in larger social goals like the climate transformation. This new measure brings on board more than half the world’s population. This to me was one of the most powerful, interesting ideas in the research. related New look at human development points way to inclusive growth What will a green global economy cost?

“It really made a difference.” McKinsey helps incubate AI startups,"1871, a Chicago-based nonprofit tech innovation hub supporting global tech businesses, partnered with McKinsey to level up startups with the power of AI.",2023-11-02T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/when%20would%20i%20have%20this%20opportunity/1871-hero-small-panel-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/it-really-made-a-difference-mckinsey-helps-incubate-ai-startups,"“It really made a difference.” McKinsey helps incubate AI startups Former McKinsey Partner Satya Rao (left) with AI expert panelists from around the Chicago area November 2, 2023 1871 was buzzing with energy and excitement. At the end of June, the Chicago-based nonprofit tech hub hosted its 2023 AI Innovation Lab, culminating in an AI Innovation Summit , a public capstone-like event. Thirty-nine startup founders from Chicago and around the country formed the cohort of the lab. The day of programming at the summit, which the cohort had been preparing for throughout the three-month lab program , gave them the chance to pitch their companies in front of roughly 300 local VCs, AI experts, CXOs, founders, and corporate innovators. The event also served the local community, providing anyone with the opportunity to attend the plenary and breakout rooms. Known for supporting its members through curated programming, resources, and community events, 1871 is home to roughly 500 early-stage tech startups, 250 growth- and late-stage companies, 60 corporates, and thousands of members. It exists to drive inclusive, sustainable economic development, fostering innovation, job creation, and prosperity in Chicago and beyond. McKinsey joined the AI Innovation Lab as an anchor sponsor. In addition to financial support, we held speaker series, mentorship rounds, and workshops at the AI Summit to work directly with the startup founders. Topics covered included product development tips and tricks, go-to-market strategies, and lessons from startup CEOs. The McKinsey demo served as a starter for how we should be using LLM in our work with cancer data. “At 1871, we believe that problem solving is a team sport,” says Betsy Ziegler, CEO of 1871 and former McKinsey partner (‘98-11). “AI will touch everything we do eventually. We need leaders from across industries, functions and companies to challenge the status quo, encourage experimentation, and drive partnerships. That is when positive change happens. It is great to be in an active partnership with the firm on one of the most important topics of our generation.” Over 30 firm leaders participated, including associate partner Parisa Sbak. “It’s always energizing to play a part in local innovation,” says Parisa. “We at McKinsey were inspired by the track record of 1871 and excited to contribute—and learn. The innovations aimed to improve the lives and livelihood of communities to sustainability and green business building. We are honored to have mentored the founders.” Below are key takeaways of the program from three participants. Dennis Trujillo, CEO, Mercurial AI, Inc. Mercurial AI is harnessing AI and computer vision to transform cancer care, both by expediting treatment plans for doctors and assisting patients in navigating their care. There were so many helpful insights from the McKinsey team that we have used to help build our demos. The healthcare session was particularly useful because it focused on large language models (LLM) in the healthcare space. The McKinsey demo served as a starter idea for how we should be using LLM in our work with cancer data. We’ve built a solution tailored to cancer care specifically and used the McKinsey demo as a springboard for our own development in this niche sector. The feedback the McKinsey mentors provided was very pertinent because it got us to narrow our targeted end consumer to payors in the medical space. They also helped facilitate connections to payors—that was key. I then refined how to approach investors. We got to pitch a VC we’d been targeting recently, and we only got to do that because of our participation in 1871 and the opportunities it opened. Marc Ward, founder, Socian Technologies Socian technologies has developed The EDGE System, a drone solution that can help officers identify when someone is armed or not—thereby reducing unnecessary violence. When I started my autonomous drone systems company, the investors said ‘focus on software and don’t build out the hardware.’ But that didn’t feel right to me, and I developed both together. After listening to those in the 1871 cohort as well as my customers right here in the local Chicago community—as opposed to VCs removed from it—my model of both hardware and software development has been validated and I now have the momentum to proceed. In a seat of CEO where I don’t get much validation, especially from my background, it’s hard out there. But in this program, it’s about building and validating what’s next. I mean, when would I, as an underrepresented and underestimated founder, have this opportunity to talk to a partner at McKinsey about digital transformation? It really made a difference. I was so proud to win the People’s Choice award because I built this tech for the people, and many at the event told me how needed this tech is in their communities. Alane Boyd, co-founder & CEO, Arvo Arvo is an AI-powered sales tool that simplifies creating proposals, case studies, client portals, and more for sales, training, and scaling. We came into 1871 thinking about integrating AI into Arvo on a superficial level, like text prompts and outputs. But after this cohort, and what we’ve seen with customers, we need to think bigger: How can AI make life easier at work? One way is through process documentation, such as standard operating procedures and training docs—not always a high priority for companies, but essential for scaling. How can we turn process documentation into the easiest thing you do at your company? Our eyes were opened to just how much of an impact AI can play in that mission. Another big opportunity was presenting to an audience of business owners who are actively growing their companies, and to mentors from McKinsey. A customer doesn’t always give honest feedback after a pitch, but a room full of other founders and unbiased mentors will. You’ll see things you missed and refine how you describe your product to new users. If I’m not being clear to the other founders in the cohort, the customers I’m demoing to certainly won’t get it either. Lastly, I will never forget McKinsey’s presentation on Digital Twins, because it is part of the bigger picture I needed to see on how companies are incorporating AI. Note from McKinsey: We were saddened to learn that Marc Ward passed away unexpectedly shortly after this project concluded. His bright talent, innovation and warmth were infectious and an inspiration to all the McKinsey colleagues who worked with him. Our condolences go out to his family and colleagues.

"From capabilities to sustainable growth, McKinsey and SHOFCO deliver far-reaching impact in Kenya","Through deep, organization-wide training and by strengthening programs, McKinsey helped SHOFCO transform to ensure it can serve more communities for the long term.",2023-11-20T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/from%20capabilities%20to%20sustainable%20growth/shofco-hero-small-grads-1536x864.jpg,"Africa,Inclusive Economy",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/from-capabilities-to-sustainable-growth-mckinsey-and-shofco-deliver-far-reaching-impact-in-kenya,"From capabilities to sustainable growth, McKinsey and SHOFCO deliver far-reaching impact in Kenya SHOFCO staff celebrate completing the A2E program, certificates in hand. November 20, 2023 What started as a game of soccer is now an organization with 1,000 employees transforming the lives of millions. In 2004, Kennedy Odede founded SHOFCO (Shining Hope for Communities), an organization that provides essential services and advocates on behalf of communities in an urban slum outside of Nairobi, Kibera—Kennedy’s hometown. But this sprawling grassroots organization began years earlier, as a youth group focused on sports that Kennedy formed when he was just 15. He’s been on a journey to grow and professionalize his mission ever since. “As a poor street child in Kibera, I wasn’t trying to start an organization, I was just helping my community and solving problems,” says Kennedy. “The biggest challenge I’ve struggled with is, ‘how do you build an institution?’” SHOFCO now operates in 40 of 47 counties across Kenya, reaching over 2 million people and is continuing to expand rapidly. To support this growth, McKinsey.org , McKinsey’s global philanthropic initiative to help build the capabilities of nonprofits, spent a year supporting SHOFCO. Working pro bono, McKinsey’s Nairobi office also worked to improve the financial sustainability of three of SHOFCO’s programs. We incorporated the language of the program into our daily work, and even when we were having a cup of tea. “SHOFCO is an amazing organization that absolutely changes the world for the people in Kenya’s largest urban slums,” says Harald Pöltner , a partner in the Nairobi office. “Supporting their growth and expansion is vital work our firm is proud to be part of.” Focusing on the ‘Essentials’ One of McKinsey.org’s flagship programs is Ability to Execute (A2E) for Nonprofits , which builds the capacity employees need to drive organizational change. By honing essential skills ranging from prioritization to giving feedback, the program helps teams shift mindsets and establish a common language that leads to better ways of working. “Eighty percent of our staff are from the community,” says Kennedy. “Things like keeping meetings on schedule and focused: when you grow up in a Kibera slum, how do you know these things?” The A2E program also sustains learning over time, giving participants the opportunity to integrate the concepts into their work and the culture of the organization. “We ask each other about our energy levels, remind people to do pre-mortems and run meetings that matter,” says Dr. Caroline Kisia , former COO of SHOFCO about the impact of the program. “We incorporated the language of A2E into our daily work, and even when we were having a cup of tea.” The program was dynamic—delivered online and also in-person because most people did not have reliable digital access. McKinsey.org’s Cara Volpe led the team that partnered with SHOFCO and traveled to Kibera to train departmental champions to take the skills to all levels of the organization. “By activating a large group of internal champions who cascaded the program throughout their departments, entire teams changed how they worked together and individuals with little access to digital tools were able to participate in the experience,” says Cara. After a few months of going through the programs themselves, managers then led huddles to coach their frontline staff, from schools to clinics, on these skills, eventually reaching over 500 staff across SHOFCO. The new tools helped Welma Atieno, a STEAM teacher at the Kibera School for Girls who also trains teachers, both in her own work and in her supervisory capacity. “My teachers now come to our trainings prepared and organized, and by focusing on my ‘big rocks’ (high-priority tasks) I have more time and energy to give them and my students,” says Welma. “And for myself, I know I want to move up into management, and now I have the skills. I cannot recommend this program enough.” Keeping SHOFCO around for generations Meanwhile, McKinsey’s pro bono team came in to evaluate three programs SHOFCO was looking to scale: a low-cost wholesale of critical food staples, a savings and credit cooperative, and a funeral insurance program. Each of these three programs had their own unique challenges. The recommendations from the McKinsey team varied: they found that the food wholesale model wasn’t primed for expansion and the funeral insurance cooperative carried a high level of risk. “We helped them realize that the right path forward can be more nuanced than simply doing more of what is having impact,” says Austin Schaefer , engagement manager on the pro bono work. The savings and credit cooperative, however, was a program Schaefer and the team recommended expanding. SHOFCO saw that low-income people had a need for its service, as the number of account holders was rising, currently at 15,000. It wanted to put donor money into meeting this demand. “SHOFCO was trying to operate a bank without a profit motive, just its own financial stability,” says Austin. “And they were overwhelmed trying to sustain their rate of growth.” Expanding sustainably would be key to continuing to increase donor support. The McKinsey team looked at the loan cycle process and deciphered how many staff to hire and with which skill sets, and where to open additional field offices, setting them on a path to breaking their logjam. “The McKinsey team gave us detailed reports and recommendations to move us toward financial sustainability,” says Dr. Kisia. “They’ve stayed in touch with SHOFCO and continue to be a resource as we implement.” For Kennedy, it’s another big step on his journey to bring prosperity to his hometown of Kibera. “I have hope we'll keep on strengthening our institution,” Kennedy says. “We started with 20 cents and a soccer ball and look where we are now. Just imagine what’s possible.” Never miss a story"
The &ldquo;Missing Billion&rdquo;: creating health equity through data for people with disabilities,McKinsey Health Institute is part of a global coalition committed to transforming health systems to be inclusive of people with disabilities&mdash;one piece of data at a time.,2023-12-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/missing%20billion/missingbillions-hero-small-cgistage-1536x864.jpg,Healthcare,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/the-missing-billion-creating-health-equity-through-data-for-people-with-disabilities,"The “Missing Billion”: creating health equity through data for people with disabilities Missing Billion commitment partners at Clinton Global Initiative with Chelsea Clinton. December 5, 2023 Around the world, people with disabilities face barriers to accessing healthcare—often with major consequences. “The doctor couldn’t understand that I was pregnant. I was given pain medication for stomachache and sent home,” says a pregnant woman with a hearing impairment. “I was used to having frequent headaches due to having low vision and was so conditioned to the pain that I did not realize when to seek help. We only got to know about the tumor when it was at a later stage,” says an adolescent with low vision. These are just a couple of the quotes in the recent report from The Missing Billion Initiative and McKinsey Health Institute (MHI), The missing billion: Lack of disability data impedes healthcare equity . The report explores the impact of countries not collecting adequate data on people with disabilities and their needs. “We cannot close in on global health equity without clarity on what health challenges people with disabilities face,” said Phyllis Heydt, co-founder of the Missing Billion Initiative, an organization founded to transform health systems to be inclusive of the 1.3 billion people with disabilities globally. “Data is essential to provide greater clarity and move to action.” In September, MHI joined Missing Billion and other partners the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) , the International Disability Alliance , and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in a Commitment to Action announced with Chelsea Clinton at Clinton Global Initiative. It is aimed at reducing the 10- to 20-year life expectancy gap people with disabilities face compared to people without disabilities by transforming health systems. “As part of the McKinsey Health Institute’s work to add years to life and life to years, we invest significantly in important work to reduce health inequities, including addressing global gaps in care for people living with disabilities,” says Erica Coe , who co-leads MHI. Ahmed Osman , McKinsey associate partner, and partner Dr. Mona Hammami , both based in the United Arab Emirates are leads for MHI in the Middle East. They worked extensively on the report. Here, they discuss McKinsey’s unique role to play in driving change, the challenges of changing health systems, and more. Why was this report on missing data on disability the starting point for MHI’s work? Mona: Players in this space—governments, donors, private sector—all know disability inclusion is an important problem but haven’t prioritized it yet. It’s hard to do without clear evidence through data of how many people this is affecting in a given health system; while the definition of disability is missing, the way disability presents in systems is also missing. Players often can’t believe how big of a problem this really is, so we are shining a light on it. Ahmed: We also need a baseline from which to measure our progress as the commitment progresses, which we can’t do without data. What is MHI’s unique role in the coalition? Ahmed: There’s a few ways we’re contributing. One is opening doors through our networks. For instance, in the UAE, we’ve been able to activate the regulator and public providers to deploy tools for systems-level change that we have jointly created with Missing Billion, and facility-level change that will impact patient journeys. These include improved data collection, and improved involvement and representation of people with disabilities. We were quickly on the ground in hospitals in Abu Dhabi, and we’re now working on scaling this effort across other countries. Mona: We’re also convening new players that we’re uniquely able to reach. This puts disability inclusion on the agenda in places where it’s been completely sidelined. We are helping crystallize the story and make it mainstream. This helps move from talking and awareness to funding, implementing, and impact. What are some main challenges of changing health systems? Ahmed: This is a problem around the world, in both wealthy countries and not. Most governments have not yet applied the lens of disability inclusion in their policy making, and there are many systems-level interventions that are agnostic of the type of impairment an individual has that need to be implemented. In many cases, we’re still at the basic level of even having a definition of disability. We are helping crystallize the story and make it mainstream. This helps move from talking and awareness to funding, implementing, and impact. While change has to start with governments, funders, NGOs and implementers, all have a role to play, and it will be different in every country. The private sector can also play a role here along with areas related to disability inclusion outside of health. There seems to be further interest from these private sector companies to come together and collaborate on the topic. Some of these players came together on the sidelines of the Clinton Global Initiative for an action-oriented discussion about what's needed to help catalyze progress globally that McKinsey hosted. How does this work fit into McKinsey’s broader commitment to sustainable, inclusive growth? Mona: This is at the core of what we as a firm stand for, creating holistic impact for a completely marginalized group whose needs, due to existing data gaps, are unaccounted for in health, economic and social systems. People with disabilities are 16 percent of the global population. This issue needs to be center stage, and people living with disabilities must be part of every plan for care and growth. I’m proud that our firm is helping lead the way. related 988: Three digits and the nationwide effort to help millions in crisis Never miss a story"
McKinsey pro-bono effort helps shed light on “hidden” cause of child blindness,"Perkins School for the Blind works to respond globally to CVI, a cause of child blindness thought to be rare&mdash;but a McKinsey data analysis helps prove it&rsquo;s critically underdiagnosed.",2023-12-05T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20pro%20bono%20effort%20helps%20shed%20light%20on%20hidden%20cause%20of%20child%20blindness/perkins-hero-small-kids-1536x864.jpg,Healthcare,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-pro-bono-effort-helps-shed-light-on-hidden-cause-of-child-blindness,"McKinsey pro-bono effort helps shed light on “hidden” cause of child blindness Three boys joyously play with illuminated stacking blocks. Photo courtesy of Perkins School for the Blind. December 5, 2023 Many people assume that blindness is an issue with the eye—clinicians and special educators included. But many children with blindness have perfectly healthy eyes. Instead, their blindness is due to cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI), a brain-based visual impairment caused by damage to the visual processing areas of the brain. Because the visual impairment comes from the brain, it most often presents in children who have another neurological diagnosis. CVI can present in many ways, such as difficulty recognizing materials, processing motion, or safely navigating through space. These factors can make CVI difficult to diagnose, leaving kids without the specialized care they need. “This has really been a hidden epidemic ,” says Ilse Willems , senior director of the CVI Center at Perkins School for the Blind , an international NGO in Boston for children with CVI that also advocates for CVI awareness, resources, and support. “We’ve never had the data to show just how prevalent CVI really is.” That’s starting to change. Perkins, undertook a sweeping research study to understand the extent to which CVI is underdiagnosed in the US, and McKinsey joined to provide critical data analyses. The study identified about 180,000 cases of CVI in the US, even though only 24,000 were officially diagnosed—and this is still likely an undercount. The work confirmed what those at Perkins had long suspected. “We received authoritative verification of what is, to some, a mystery affliction,” says Dave Power , president and CEO of Perkins. “The study told us there's more incidence than we might've imagined.” A methodical approach Collecting data to analyze the prevalence of CVI would not be easy. Sarah Pickard , a doctor who has experience caring for CVI patients and is now an expert in the firm’s Life Science practice, had a clear grasp of the challenge ahead—for instance, there is not a single unique code to identify CVI in the data. “We’re dealing with the lack of a unique medical insurance diagnosis code, a lack of CVI training for practitioners, and a lack of sufficient resources to address the amount of need,” says Sarah. Sarah and the McKinsey team started with donated data from Komodo Health , a healthcare patient data company, and then interviewed clinical experts to understand how to identify CVI patients within this real-world, anonymized data. McKinsey data scientists then used this information to build an algorithm, giving the team a machine-learning engine to find children with CVI in the patient data. The algorithm uses several characteristics from the data of patients with a diagnosis of CVI to assess against patients without a CVI diagnosis. Using these factors, it’s able to determine the likelihood of CVI being present in patients without a diagnosis. “What we found is that for every one patient that was diagnosed there were about four more that weren't diagnosed,” says Sarah. “And we believe this may be a conservative estimate.” Putting the data to work The McKinsey team mapped out the data into a visualization that they then overlayed with county-level data of a variety of social risk factors, including access to physicians, percent uninsured, poverty rate, and access to transportation. We really generated what I would say is new information for the field that likely would not have been able to be generated without these resources. This patient data combined with population health information is helping guide Perkins’ next steps in advocating for CVI patients. Now, Perkins can target its work for the best impact, and back up its initiatives with the McKinsey data. Their work includes creating training materials for medical providers, teachers of students with visual impairments and others who work with them, such as physical therapists and speech therapists; conducting training on diagnosing CVI, including ways to test in a clinical setting, especially for nonverbal patients; and advocating for the creation of a medical code for CVI. These tools will be especially useful in areas where data shows CVI prevalence is high, but resources are scant. Providers for and parents of children with CVI from around the world look to Perkins for support and information and attend their annual conference in Boston. Because CVI is a neurological disorder, with the right therapies, children have the potential to really improve functional vision. “When a child makes progress, it’s like a miracle, but you can't pull off those miracles without a playbook, and that’s what we’re providing,” says Dave. “And now we have the data we need to do it.” related The “Missing Billion”: creating health equity through data for people with disabilities Never miss a story"

Forrester evaluated 15 firms, assessing them on 21 criteria in three categories. McKinsey also received the highest score on the ‘current offering’ axis out of all the vendors evaluated. According to the Forrester report: “The oldest of the big three strategy consulting houses, McKinsey has articulated its superior transformation vision following its Rewired concept. Acknowledging the need for multi-dimensional change, the firm drives transformation across strategy, talent, operating model, technology, and data.” The report further notes that “QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, has become a powerful differentiator for the firm as it innovates in data science and AI.”  “We are very honored by this recognition and continue to focus in driving sustainable and inclusive AI impact for our clients by developing the most distinctive end-to-end AI offering in the market,” Alex Singla , a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack. “Over the last few years, we have been enhancing our capabilities through a combination of world-class AI talent, organic innovation, plus a combination of thoughtful acquisitions and an open ecosystem of partners.” QuantumBlack McKinsey has helped ' rewire ’ or transform some 200 clients over the past five years. “Leaders who have truly begun to rewire their businesses understand it’s more than executing on a  set of discrete projects,” shares Rob Levin , a senior partner who leads our Digital and AI Transformation Practice. “It’s building the long-term capability to consistently innovate, adopt, and scale technology-led solutions wherever there is value to be had in the business.” The Forrester report also states that the firm has “strong organizational design and change capabilities to drive transformation across the enterprise.” One reason is that on day one of a project, our leaders start planning how a solution will scale across the business. A laser focus on design thinking—how the end users will be interacting with and applying the solution—also differentiates our work. “There is no transformation unless the intended internal users change how they work or the external users change how they interact with our products and services,” says Rob. “In this sense, enterprise technology isn’t different from consumer technology; when a technology truly solves friction in our day to day, we adopt it. No amount of corporate mandate can force true adoption if the utility isn’t there.” For example, a McKinsey team helped a mining company adopt AI-powered ways of working in their copper-processing operations.  Everyone, including metallurgists, mining engineers, and data scientists, changed the way they worked across every aspect of production, and then scaled the solution across seven sites. We also collaborated with an insurance company  to transform their middle and back office operations with a state-of-the-art digital platform. It could be implemented across all countries in record time—and then the teams iteratively built up consumer use of these new digital channels. As AI adoption accelerates, businesses can't afford to wait a couple of years before experimenting. They need to make progress now for competitive reasons, even though nearly every company has imperfect system, data or talent foundations. Rewired in Action According to the Forrester report, the client references they interviewed “appreciated [McKinsey’s] focus on getting more value out of the existing architecture before jumping into implementation of new solutions.” “When it comes to the core technology stack, technologists, and practices, our experience has shown that we can have our cake and eat it too,” observes Aamer Baig , a senior partner and global leader of McKinsey Technology. “We can create new high quality and scalable capabilities for data and AI in the cloud, while bridging to the company’s existing tech stack. Moreover, we can thoughtfully build and deliver these capabilities in parallel without waiting for large enterprise IT programs to launch or complete. This is a cultural challenge for many traditional tech organizations but one that is well worth pursuing.” related McKinsey named a “Leader” in AI Never miss a story"
A year of impact&mdash;powered by people,McKinsey&rsquo;s chief people officer reflects on how our distinctive talent has helped our clients and firm make meaningful progress this year.,2023-12-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/a%20year%20of%20impact%20powered%20by%20people/peoplemilestones-hero-small-mckteam-1536x864.jpg,,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/a-year-of-impact-powered-by-people-connected-as-one-global-team,"A year of impact—powered by people Leads client transformation and research around technology-enabled operations and manufacturing December 19, 2023 HBR has described McKinsey as a “leadership factory.” Our firm has been recognized this year by Time and Forbes , among others, for having produced more board members, CEOs, and other leaders than any other company. We are honored by this distinction because we believe that exceptional talent and extraordinarily complex challenges go hand-in-hand. This belief informs both our client service and the way we work as a firm. As the demands on leaders grow more complex, we recognize that growth, inclusion and impact start with getting the talent equation right—within their organizations and beyond. As McKinsey’s chief people officer, I’m proud of how our distinctive talent has helped our clients and firm make meaningful progress this year. Here are a few of the milestones I’m reflecting on as we close the year. Tearing down the “paper ceiling” by embracing potential beyond pedigree In a world where disruption has become the norm, the ability to learn new things and be flexible is key. At McKinsey, we see this trend play out every day. That’s why we’ve broadened our campus-based sources of talent from about 700 core schools in 2020 to about 1,400 today, with plans to expand to more than 5,000. Our recruiting teams now use game-based assessments that level the playing field for those without prior business experience. And we are providing learning, development, and apprenticeship opportunities to empower colleagues to think about their own career self-authorship. This year, we also partnered with the nonprofit Opportunity@Work to tear the “paper ceiling” and help the more than 70 million workers in the US who are “skilled through alternative routes.” These workers are often overlooked due to lack of a traditional degree, yet hold enormous potential for the workforce and society at large. We continue to hire more candidates through programs like apprenticeships or data boot camps, combining practical experience with hands-on support and coaching. Doubling down on apprenticeship We see apprenticeship as a “way of life ,” rather than a program to execute. We encourage employees to take the driver’s seat in their professional development, by taking a self-authored approach catalyzed by mentorship and apprenticeship.  In 2023, we hosted a number of Apprenticeship Days in offices around the world, and have plans to host even more in 2024. Leveraging gen AI and other technology to accelerate impact Beyond using technology to bring in more diverse talent, we leverage it to help existing colleagues deepen their skills—and accelerate the way they deliver impact with clients. We recently launched Lilli , our firm’s proprietary gen AI solution for colleagues, that enables them to scan our entire knowledge base to bring the best of our insights, capabilities, and technology solutions to clients—in seconds. We know gen AI and other advanced technologies can only generate value through the skills of people. That’s why we’ve doubled down on self-directed learning in support of individual ambitions and company priorities, with 34K McKinsey-created learning offerings. I am especially proud that 50K+ colleagues have taken training programs this year, a 5 percent increase YoY. Informing the conversation on diversity, equity, and inclusion For the last decade, McKinsey has been on a journey to shape a global perspective on the relationship between leadership diversity and company performance. This year, we published the fourth installation of our research, Diversity matters more than ever , which includes—for the first time—a link to ESG metrics and shows the business case for diversity, equity, and inclusion is stronger than ever. We also continued our Women in the Workplace partnership with Lean In. Our 2023 report found for every 100 men elevated from the entry level to manager, only 87 women and a mere 73 women of color find themselves making the climb. Only by bringing these challenges to the fore can we address the systemic causes of inequities and help women rise to senior leadership roles unhindered by invisible barriers. Creating an even more inclusive firm for our diverse colleagues We are proud to be home to a distinctive and diverse community of colleagues, and we are committed to continually improving the way we work in service to them. We introduced a new reboarding program for working parents which was recently selected as a World Economic Forum lighthouse for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Elsewhere, our colleagues created new affinity groups, such as Access, which provides support to colleagues with disabilities, chronic illnesses, and mental health challenges, and Prism, founded to connect colleagues passionate about social inclusion and mobility. And we were proud to welcome 250 more incredible leaders to our partnership this year, which today represents a broader range of backgrounds and career paths than ever before, including colleagues from across our affinity groups and those without a traditional university degree.

McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation,"The expanded collaboration will help leaders adopt generative AI to build sustainable, resilient, and adaptive businesses.",2024-01-15T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20and%20sap%20expand%20alliance/mcksap-hero-small-1496606803-1536x864.jpg,"AI & Analytics,Digital",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-expands-alliance-with-sap-to-accelerate-generative-ai-enabled-transformation,"McKinsey expands alliance with SAP to accelerate generative AI-enabled transformation January 15, 2024 McKinsey is proud to announce a new generative AI collaboration with SAP that expands on its long-standing strategic alliance. The new offering, the Generative Enterprise, aims to unlock synergies between SAP Business AI and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey to help leaders bring the Generative Enterprise to life and build sustainable, resilient, and adaptive businesses. Generative AI is expected to unlock between $2.6 and 4.4 trillion in annual economic benefits and enable the automation of up to 70 percent of business activities. This potential has triggered a race for executives at companies of all sizes to quickly develop and execute plans to create AI-enabled value across their organizations About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey One path to winning that race runs with SAP, whose customers generate 87 percent of total global commerce. The organization’s core enterprise ecosystem, with SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) as the foundation, is therefore a prime area for realizing the greatest value from generative AI and other emerging technologies. “Our values compel us to help businesses effectively navigate any crisis,” says Bob Sternfels , global managing partner for McKinsey. “In the enterprise context, partnering with SAP on this vision to deliver the Generative Enterprise is a privilege that we’re grateful for. Together, we can help pave the sustainable path to impact through technology.” “Relevant, reliable, and responsible AI can help transform companies faster than ever,” says Christian Klein , CEO and member of the executive board of SAP SE. “This collaboration with McKinsey on the Generative Enterprise enables us to bring together the best of our individual strengths in technology and strategy execution to help customers unlock AI-enabled value across their core business processes.” Creating value beyond the hype Together, McKinsey and SAP have identified several value opportunity sources, including the enhancement of SAP S/4HANA’s out-of-the-box functionality and other assets that can accelerate transformation, such as code generation. But the full potential generative AI benefit, both organizations agree, goes well beyond individual applications. “There is tremendous upside with generative AI for businesses with a cloud-enabled application portfolio,” says Bjørnar Jensen , McKinsey senior partner, McKinsey Digital Europe leader, and SAP alliance global leader. “The mature, structured business processes and system insights from SAP present exciting possibilities for generative AI-enabled transformation.” “We are excited to expand our longstanding relationship with SAP,” says Alexander Sukharevsky , McKinsey senior partner and global co-leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. “Our joint R&D and scaling efforts will continue to dramatically shift cost curves for leading organizations while reinventing their business models and the industries they operate in.” In the enterprise context, partnering with SAP on this vision to deliver the Generative Enterprise is a privilege that we’re grateful for. Together, we can help pave the sustainable path to impact through technology. McKinsey research on resilient businesses indicates that managing disruptions defines sustainable growth more than managing continuity. McKinsey and SAP agree that generative AI can help improve the overall resilience of a business. This is the genesis of the Generative Enterprise vision. The new offering can help clients use generative AI to adapt to disruption through perpetual synchronization across strategy, operating models, process and data design, and operational execution enabled by AI. “More than 70 percent of the value from business transformations across sectors is critically dependent on technology,” says Aamer Baig , global McKinsey Technology leader. “The ability of business to perpetually synchronize from strategy through process execution and technology will ensure realization of maximum value potential and help avoid unnecessary technical debt.” Guided by the transformation roadmap and approach described in Rewired: The McKinsey guide to outcompeting in the age of digital and AI , McKinsey is also collaborating with SAP to define a Generative Enterprise playbook that includes an AI-driven reference for business operating models. Organizations with high product operating model maturity across geographies and industries have 60 percent higher returns to shareholders. SAP & McKinsey The offering also features platform reference architecture that combines process excellence, broad AI architecture and MLOps, cloud deployment platform, and enterprise architecture governance. “We are very excited about collaborating with SAP on the Generative Enterprise to shape customer contextual models for enterprise application,” says Darwin Deano , a McKinsey partner and architect of Generative Enterprise. Finally, the Generative Enterprise offers a multi-dimensional library of AI use cases and the corresponding business scenario roadmaps. McKinsey is committed to helping businesses be ready for any scenario. Together with SAP, we are vigorously shaping the Generative Enterprise roadmap and deploying select use cases with flagship clients. related McKinsey and SAP join forces to maximize business transformation value through cloud solutions"
McKinsey helps accelerate Black economic development in Colorado,"Through a variety of pro bono support, McKinsey helped Jice Johnson realize her vision for Black economic empowerment by creating three unique organizations with one common mission.",2024-01-26T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20helps%20suite%20of%20black%20economic%20development%20organizations%20take%20hold%20in%20colorado/bbi-hero-small-event-1536x864.jpg,"Inclusive Economy,Social Impact",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-helps-accelerate-black-economic-development-in-colorado,"McKinsey helps accelerate Black economic development in Colorado Participants in the Black Business Initiative’s Black Boss Summit January 26, 2024 Jice Johnson saw a problem in her community and decided she’d address it. Never mind that she wasn’t exactly experienced in the sector, and the scope of the issue was broad and deep: She had drive, ideals, and commitment—the kind of person who didn’t hesitate to sign up to serve in the US Army after high school, shortly after 9/11. When Jice returned from the army, she earned a master’s in management and leadership and worked in business administration and real estate. But as she saw racial injustice and its economic toll around her, she felt called to address it. “How could I help? There's no cause to sign up and join like when I went into the military,” says Jice. “I decided to take my business degree and at the very minimum hold a workshop on business development for the local Black community in Denver.” This work grew into the Black Business Initiative (BBI), a public benefit corporation (similar to a B-corp) founded in 2015 that supports and empowers Black entrepreneurs. In 2020, Jice worked with McKinsey associate partner Chris Daehnick on a plan to assist Black businesses struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic and on realizing her broader mission and vision. “He told me I was essentially looking at launching three more organizations and it would be a tall order,” she says. “I said, ‘let’s go.’” The additional three are now up and running as separate but complementary organizations with the common mission of Black economic empowerment: The AYA Foundation , which works to close the Black wealth gap through grants and technical supports for Black business owners; the Denver affiliate of the New Community Transformation Fund (now the DEMI FUND) , a value capital fund that invests in companies owned and operated by business leaders of color; and the Economic Development Association for Black Communities , which develops inclusive economic development strategies and programming for Denver’s local Black community and advocates for policy solutions. Jice and AYA Foundation executive director Benilda “Benny” Samuels explain how these organizations put economic power in the hands of the Black community and how McKinsey served as the right type of ally. Black Business Initiative was the first organization you launched. What was your approach? Jice: Sometimes we don't know what we don't know. I wanted to work with Black entrepreneurs to bridge their knowledge gaps, because if they’re not asking the right questions, it’s hard to advance. I’d say, ""You think social media marketing is all you need, but we're also going to talk about building sales funnels, because if you don't have leads, then you're not going to get real traffic from organic marketing."" How did BBI evolve once you started creating additional organizations? Jice: As a membership organization , the focus of BBI is now more on convening and networking, with the learning piece being housed by AYA Foundation. Benny: We’ve inherited the programmatic work that BBI was running, because that was subsidized—it was essentially charitable work for the community. McKinsey understands that if the Black community is doing well economically, we’re all doing well. That is a model for how support should be. How did you set up AYA Foundation to serve the community? Benny: In my 35 years in social change, our community has not had a public charity foundation dedicated to the Black community. Other charities housed the resources and gave them to us. AYA is a public charity that offers grants and runs programs on wealth building and entrepreneurship. It’s a model that is connected to the community. We don’t need to send out surveys to find out what the community needs because we are right there with them. What kind of impact is AYA having? Benny: In the short three years since beginning our operations, AYA Foundation’s creative, systems changing impact includes serving more than 91 founders and entrepreneurs with high-touch programs, technical assistance, and grants. Additionally, AYA Foundation has acted as the fiscal sponsor of philanthropic dollars to several start-ups, including the DEMI FUND. Philanthropic dollars are sometimes used to support start-ups because of the inequitable barriers to entry for fund managers of color and the absence a network of family-and-friends investors. AYA’s fiscal sponsorship allowed for philanthropic dollars to be used to reduce the barriers to entry to starting an investment fund and to provide the matching funds required for investors. With these barriers reduced, DEMI became one of the largest first-time funds raised by a solo black woman general partner in the country. How did McKinsey help with all these efforts? Benny: We had to build infrastructure from the ground up, and that’s where Chris and McKinsey were tremendously helpful with AYA. First, Chris agreed to serve on our board, and he brings everything that he has to support us, like capacity support in business and strategic planning. A McKinsey team helped us build our first strategic plan, inclusive of a budget, which allowed us to do institutional fundraising with real credibility. Later, another McKinsey team helped us with a scaling plan, which helped us begin to accept donor advised funds. Jice: McKinsey understands that if the Black community is doing well economically, we’re all doing well. That is a model for how support should be. It’s frustrating when allies are content to hold control of resources and send them where they believe they make the most impact. Building our own institutions allows us to bring that function into our community and not be a recipient of help, but to build the capacity to be the help. Chris and his team really got that.

McKinsey Health Institute unveils investment case for closing the women&rsquo;s health gap,"World Economic Forum and McKinsey&rsquo;s landmark report, which found that women spend 25 percent more of their lives in poor health, helped launch the Global Alliance on Women&rsquo;s Health.",2024-01-30T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mhi%20unveils%20investment%20case%20for%20closing%20the%20womens%20health%20gap/womenshealth-hero-small-1680657498-1536x864.jpg,Healthcare,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mhi-unveils-investment-case-for-closing-the-womens-health-gap,"McKinsey Health Institute unveils investment case for closing the women’s health gap January 30, 2024 Women’s health took center stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week with the presentation of the first-ever report on the gender health gap and its health and economic toll. Authored by the McKinsey Health Institute and World Economic Forum, the report found addressing the health gap—which currently equates to 75 million years of life lost due to poor health or early death—could boost the global economy by at least $1 trillion annually by 2040. While women live longer on average, they face a variety of health disadvantages compared with men and spend 25 percent more of their lives in poor health. Fixing this could add seven healthy days per woman per year on average, leading to longer lives and more days spent in good health. Women with very serious health conditions wind up lost in health systems for years. “Our firm’s commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth requires everyone to be in their best health, but women have been left behind,” explains Lucy Pérez , a McKinsey senior partner who leads the McKinsey Health Institute’s health equity portfolio and was a lead author of the report. “We found this is a global problem with major implications including lower quality of life, limited employment opportunities, and barriers to accessible medical care.” The analysis is based on a detailed assessment of the 64 conditions that account for more than 85 percent of the female global disease burden in total. The report outlines several sobering statistics. In analyzing more than 650 academic research papers, the team found that close to half didn’t provide data on sex-based differences. “This data gap leads to a lack of understanding of how medicine and science work for women, and it contributes to their often receiving substandard care,” says McKinsey partner and MHI report co-author Anouk Petersen . “The team found that in only half of cases was sex-disaggregated data available, and in those cases, women were disadvantaged more than two-thirds of the time.” Sexual and reproductive health has often been treated as the extent of women’s health, but the report found that their health burden is much wider than that. Studies from Denmark showed that women wait longer for a diagnosis than men for a range of diseases—up to 2.5 years longer for cancer and 4.5 years for diabetes. “There are many conditions that impact women differently or disproportionately,” says Valentina Sartori , a McKinsey partner and co-author of the MHI report. “When women present with certain symptoms, the healthcare system might fail to recognize them. For example, one study found that women were up to seven times more likely to be misdiagnosed and sent home from the emergency department during a heart attack.” This is an opportunity for women to make choices for themselves. At the same time, women-specific conditions such as endometriosis remain undiagnosed and untreated. “Women with very serious health conditions wind up lost in health systems for years, sometimes being told the condition is ‘in their head,’ when in fact they have a serious illness,” says Megan Ann Greenfield , a McKinsey partner and MHI-affiliated leader. All this helps explain why even though women generally live longer than men, they spend an average of nine years in poor health or with a disability. And these health challenges don’t come in women’s twilight years, but when they are likely to be in the workforce: About half of the healthy years that women lose come between ages 20 to 60. The financial cost of these lost days of health is significant. Closing the women’s health gap by 2040 could add at least $1 trillion to the economy, and every US dollar invested in women’s health could add $3 to the economy. This applies to women working inside and outside the home. Addressing the gap could generate the equivalent impact of 137 million women accessing full-time positions by 2040, lifting many out of poverty. “Eighty percent of the time, women are the primary caregiver in the family to sick people. A healthier population also means fewer people who need to spend time in unpaid caregiving work,” says Anouk. “This is an opportunity for women to make choices for themselves on how to use that additional freed up time.” The report served as a catalyst for action, powering the launch of the Global Alliance of Women’s Health , committed to changing how women’s health is funded and prioritized. Hosted by World Economic Forum, the alliance will work across sectors to increase investment in women’s health and awareness of the issue on the global agenda. Within hours of launch, the report and the Alliance garnered significant media attention, with reports publishing in 50 countries and a surge of digital conversations appearing online using #CloseTheWomensHealthGap. “On this topic, where partnership is key to impact, you could argue that the most important part of the report is the acknowledgement of over 100 collaborators involved,” says Lucy. ""And this number will undoubtedly continue to grow.” Never miss a story"
Why every day is Leap day at McKinsey,"Two leaders of our new business-building unit, Leap by McKinsey, talk about what they’ve learned from helping clients build more than 500 new businesses, including 12 unicorns.",2024-02-29T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/why%20every%20day%20is%20leap%20day%20at%20mckinsey/leap-hero-small-1385623520-1536x864.jpg,Digital,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/why-every-day-is-leap-day-at-mckinsey,"Why every day is Leap day at McKinsey February 29, 2024 Today is Leap Day, a fitting occasion for a look at our practice devoted to new business-building, Leap by McKinsey. Since its 2018 inception, Leap has built over 600 new businesses, including 20 “unicorns” or companies valued at more than $1 billion, and two decacorns valued at more than $10 billion. In 2022 alone, Leap helped clients build more than 190 new businesses, creating more than 20,000 jobs and $140 billion in value. And they’re just getting started. CEOs understand that now is the time to leverage new technologies as a source of competitive advantage. Generative AI alone, for example, is projected to power at least 75 percent of new businesses built this year. McKinsey is uniquely suited to help leaders seize the advantage these technologies offer. We are partnering with clients now to help them start generating compounding growth through the launch of new businesses. To learn more about Leap, and why every day is Leap day at McKinsey, we spoke with the practice’s global co-leaders, senior partners Ari Libarikian and Paul Jenkins . Talk to us about this moment. Why should CEOs care about building new businesses? Ari: Companies that are successful over multiple decades are always creating new sources of revenue: new products, new services, new businesses. In fact, our research shows it's a requirement for long-term success (over multiple decades). So, the question is not whether a company should build new businesses; it’s which ones to build and how? Right now, we’re in a period of uncertainty. That’s not new. What is new is the way CEOs are behaving. This time around, as compared to the global financial crisis or the dot com cycle, they're not only focused on near term resilience and cash, they’re also in parallel looking around the corner and investing in medium- and long-term growth opportunities like business building. What role is technology playing in all this? Paul: Technology is making it easier to build than ever before. There are two characteristics enabling this: connectivity and speed. If you’re a bank, for example, that wants to also become an insurer, connecting new insurance capabilities to your existing business is far more feasible than it has ever been. Or say you’re a utility company and you want to offer home retrofit services (including installation and financing), you can easily and digitally integrate with partners do provide customers with a true “one-stop-shop.” Cloud components, generative AI, and other advances are effectively collapsing time. Committed and innovative leaders can stand up a new idea so much quicker than even two or three years ago. The barrier to entry is just so much lower—and the effort required to build—is much lower than it used to be. Leap by McKinsey How is McKinsey helping clients build new businesses? Ari: In Leap, all we do is work with clients to help them imagine, launch, and scale new businesses. And when we help clients, we help them soup to nuts. We start with the initial ideas— What's the strategy? How will you drive growth? What are the business building ideas?—and we help prioritize those ideas and select what we’ll pursue. We then help clients take the next step:  blueprinting, building detailed business plans, creating the product MVP. Then it’s into the build. We help hire the team, build the technology, roll-out the product, drive customer engagement, gather feedback, improve it, and raise funding. And then we scale, running sales and marketing war rooms that help drive topline growth and value creation. Paul: That’s exactly right. We’re involved at every step in a very hands-on way. That includes the last phase, which is:  ""You now have built and launched a business. How do you now rapidly scale this so that it can reach its full potential?” We have a heavy focus on being along for the ride with our client helping them hire their long-term team and people, helping upskill and coach people. By the time we leave the building the client has something new and enduring: not just an at-scale business but a team and a set of capabilities to take it forward. Can you give an example? Ari: We worked with a power tools company to help them transition from a physical product to a digital product through a software-as-a-service business. The new business was a very different business. It had a different financial profile, different margins, and so on. It also required figuring out the types of skills needed across product development, design, digital, and sales. We deployed a team up front that played these various roles on day one, and then that team also helped hire the people who would work for the client in those roles permanently. By the time we were done, the client had a business that was well on its way toward its business goal—and it also had a team, a general manager, sales people, and tech people that could take it forward and ensure it endures. We describe ourselves at impact partners to our clients. What does that mean in this context? Paul: Nobody ever created a unicorn in two or three months. In order to really drive success, you need to be together, working as partners, for at least a year or 18 months. So there’s a time element to it and a level of relationship building and personal investment required to create success. In addition, the nature of the relationship is a partnership; you really are sitting at the same table, as almost joint-venture partners. We've identified a big opportunity together. We're going to capture it together. We're going to do it over a meaningful length of time. We will share in the benefits of our new venture. And we're going to be really challenging each other to get the best out of this all the way along that journey. Ari: When we help clients build businesses, we do this very much as partners. We are successful if our client is successful. And so we structure our partnership in a way where we are tracking impact month to month over the course of, as Paul points out, the typically couple of years of this relationship. Everything we do is pointed in the direction of helping our client build the business and build the capability for the long term. So that's what we measure ourselves against, that's what we want to get measured on to be successful partners to our clients in business building. What would you tell a CEO who’s thinking about building a new business but doesn’t know where to start? Paul: The best new businesses compete with unfair advantages in high growth areas of the economy. So put simply I would advise the CEO to begin thinking about a new business by looking at the assets and distinctive capabilities they have to see if they can deploy them to capture the business building opportunity associated with a mega trend. I’d also advise them to prepare to spend real time on this endeavor. You don't find chairs or founders of new ventures who don't spend significant time on that new venture. They also need to think about talent and diversity in the business building team. When we look across all the businesses that we've built, the single biggest driver of success is assembling the right team. Finally, I'd advise them to recognize that you need to set this up organizationally with the right conditions for speed. You need to make sure that you're able to exploit all of the advantages that come from corporate—and at the same time moving at the speed of a startup. You’re both passionate about this. In a few words, what inspires you about the work? Ari: In Leap, we've helped create 60,000 new jobs in the last few years globally. These are new jobs that didn't exist in new businesses that didn't exist. So what excites me is being able to help our clients build and create something out of nothing almost—and have that be a basis for success for them over the long term. Paul: The jobs created by those new businesses are doing some good for the world. That excites me. And these engagements are just fun—the pace, the energy.

"McKinsey welcomes SES, experts at estimating capital projects","With the acquisition of SES, McKinsey deepens its estimating capabilities, helping clients navigate the surge in capital projects construction.",2024-03-04T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20welcomes%20ses/estco-hero-small-1174121163-1536x864.jpg,"Acquisitions,Capital Projects and Infrastructure",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-welcomes-ses-experts-at-estimating-capital-projects,"McKinsey welcomes SES, experts at estimating capital projects March 4, 2024 A wave of new capital projects is about to cross the globe. McKinsey estimates that by 2027, about $130 trillion will flood into public and private sector works as countries mobilize to meet their net zero commitments and renew aging infrastructures. Many of these will be green tech facilities that have never been built before: large-scale green hydrogen factories, new carbon technologies, energy storage facilities. To help our clients capture this unique opportunity, we are expanding our Capital Analytics capability, which provides detailed benchmarking and analytics-driven insights to project owners and developers. This week, we are welcoming Strategic Estimating Systems (SES), a Houston-based consultancy and global leader in independent cost estimating for capital projects, to the firm. Their team of estimators and cost engineers will bring deep expertise and the intellectual capital gained from 20 years of experience with more than 200 projects around the world. Capital Analytics “Our work across industries and technologies, combined with our computer-aided estimating software, and the accurate, highly efficient work processes we’ve developed have enabled us to best serve our clients through all phases of the project-execution life,” says Mike Monteith , CEO of SES. When we integrate SES's estimating capabilities and datasets with our own capital projects assets, we will strengthen our offering to help clients scope–more precisely–costs, time, and value opportunities associated with all phases of a project. We will also be able to provide estimates three times faster than traditional approaches. “SES joining our team and strengthening our capital analytics capability with richer benchmark datasets, especially in energy transition projects, and analytics-based cost estimation, comes at a point when there is significant need for new work and tremendous pressure to reduce costs,” observes Ishaan Nangia , a McKinsey senior partner. “The timing couldn't be better.” McKinsey first partnered with SES two years ago estimating costs for a green hydrogen plant, for which there were no benchmarks. We developed a highly detailed and accurate view. Our collaboration grew as integrated teams worked with some 30+ clients helping to estimate, plan, and develop facilities for battery storage, alternative energies production, plastics recycling, semiconductor, and pharmaceutical facilities. This experience proved how complementary our organizations are—and that by combining resources and expertise, we could step up the way we serve our clients at this turning point in the global economy. We can take a piece of paper and a dream and detail it out with enough accuracy to [help it]…move towards the next phase of development. “What really got us excited was realizing we could create these very detailed estimates from the bottom up and use them to inform models that allowed us to help clients in real time optimize the designs of their facilities…to evaluate scope, equipment selection, and operability tradeoffs,” explains Justin Dahl , a McKinsey partner. “This is especially valuable when you are planning a highly complex energy transition project that's never been built before.” Driving climate action & growth For example, the integrated team recently worked with a startup that had developed an alternative battery technology. They estimated—including detailed equipment analysis and alternative 3D layouts—what it would cost to scale the production ten times, from a small demonstration plant to a giga factory rolling out 20,000 units. The effort also included 20 percent in scope optimization opportunities to reduce costs during the project development phase. It provided enough detail and confidence for the company to pursue funding and grants and move to the next stage of the project. “We can take a piece of paper and a dream  and detail it out with enough accuracy that it can  be visualized as a very real project,” says Rafael Van Gysel , a solution expert. “It helps companies accurately forecast capital needs for their innovative, strategic bets, properly accounting for risks as they move towards the next phase of development.” Rafael adds, “It also helps to take dreams of a more sustainable and resilient built-environment one step closer to reality.” related McKinsey welcomes Westney Consulting, a leading capital-projects consultancy"

But some of their most innovative work is taking place onshore, in data labs and corporate boardrooms. For each of the last three years, McKinsey’s AI arm, QuantumBlack , has been applying analytics and AI to corporate data to depict exactly how businesses are working to protect the seas, our ‘blue economy.’ This annual profile, created with One Ocean Foundation, fills a critical gap in sustainability reporting: while most companies issue reports focused on land environments, none address what’s happening in our seas. One Ocean Foundation One Ocean Foundation , founded in 2017 in Italy, works to safeguard marine environments by inspiring people, especially business and civic leaders, to solve ocean problems such as overfishing, pollution, ever-rising temperatures, and eutrophication—when nutrient accumulation causes microorganism overgrowth. “Our work with McKinsey started with the Business for Ocean Sustainability project. Today this report provides a snap shot of the current status of the impact of industries on the oceans,” explains Jan Hans Georg Pachner , secretary general of the foundation. “We are now working with 54 international oceanographers to identify all of the different pressure points within the ocean environment. Some 80 percent of the issues are from land-based activities so, industries have a key role to play.” “We are very much in sync with their approach of working with large stakeholders who have the greatest influence in creating change,” says Federico Fumagalli , a McKinsey partner. “They also encourage action through sharing best practices and positive reinforcement.” Last spring, Federico along with Jacopo Ghidoni , partner with QuantumBlack, led a team of  data scientists from QuantumBlack and large language model experts from QuantumBlack Labs . They enlisted generative AI, powered by OpenAI, to analyze the sustainability reports of about 2,500  companies (300,000 pages in total) across 17 sectors, representing more than 70 percent of the world’s market capitalization. Creating value beyond the hype “The One Ocean Foundation report was the perfect use case because the information we were analyzing was public,” recalls Federico. “Our systems and protocols were already set up and we were ready to go.” “In previous years’ analyses, we could see that companies were mentioning ocean sustainability in their reporting, and we knew that there was an ambition. But what actions were they implementing? We couldn’t tell,” explains Federico. “With generative AI, we could develop a chain of thought and link one fact to the next. It’s only possible when you have a human in the loop reading the answers, devising the next set of questions, and the next.” ...what is really powerful is that it could produce answers we never had before. For example, if a company report mentioned “partnership,” generative AI could extract further details about what the partnership was achieving, such as “preserving local mangroves,” and pinpoint the exact page and mention in the report for further follow-up. “It’s important to make sure you have enough time for validation. We spent about three quarters of our project time validating our answers, creating layers of questioning so that apart from having this much richer and more meaningful answer to the question, we are certain that it’s proven,” says Jacopo. “It goes to the principles of responsible AI.” It’s also critical to think big. “We knew that gen AI could automate a daunting analysis; in our case, it reduced the production time by about 90 percent,” says Jacopo. “But what is really powerful is that it could produce answers we never had before.” Previously the team believed that the use of eco design was limited primarily to the textile industry. But through generative AI, they discovered that it was more widespread—food and other sectors also had been developing ocean-sustainable packaging, with evidence of clear examples. Overall, there is a significant opportunity for companies to start developing blue businesses—15 percent in the sample say they are focused on this—and the report outlines more than 20 business projects, technologies, and enablers to help. These range from wastewater treatments to coastal engineering to marine ecotourism—initiatives that can create value, reduce costs, and generate new revenue. The report recently received a Responsible Business Education award from the Financial Times for academic research with societal impact. With help from McKinsey and QuantumBlack, One Ocean Foundation will evolve this year’s report into an Ocean Disclosure Initiative, a framework that businesses can use to track their marine-related projects. It could be thought of as the next wave in sustainability reporting. Our work with One Ocean Foundation is an example of our ‘AI for good’ projects. We have open sourced several of the tech components used in this project to support other individuals and organizations exploring how to use AI to improve the world we live in.

It marked the first time many Asian organizations were able to join in full since the pandemic, making it a truly global event. Tech and telecommunications leaders, IT companies, and policy makers gathered to discuss the future of the industry and showcase the latest innovations: an urban air taxi; phones that are bendable—not just foldable; and jewelry that doubles as a health and fitness tracker. “There was a real motivation to learn from each other and go after new and innovative approaches and models that leaders in the industry are doing,” Venkat Atluri , senior partner, observed. Between the panels, roundtables, and workshops, our colleagues took a moment to share their reflections on the event. Tangible value with generative AI Generative AI (gen AI) has continued to cause excitement, but the focus this year has slightly shifted. As Tomás Lajous , senior partner at McKinsey, noted, “Everybody is very enthusiastic about ChatGPT and generative AI. But it has also made them think more broadly, not just about gen AI, but about analytical AI and things that they should have been doing a while back.” For example, AI will allow telcos to gain new visibility into their assets, such as their networks. They can better track outages, usage rates, and quality to improve their customers’ experience and ultimately retention. Whereas last year was focused on potential, this year was more about the concrete value AI could add. “But you need to get a lot of things right,” Tomás pointed out. “There’s a real risk that if all you do is invest in a model, you spend a lot of money, but you don’t see the value because you don’t have the right data, the right systems, or people aren’t using it the right way.” Gen AI is also leveling the playing field. For years, analytical AI projects, which were often very complex, could only be done by larger organizations; with the widespread availability of gen AI, smaller businesses can take on these implementations as well. And since they are more agile, they’re able to make changes faster, so we may see smaller organizations taking the lead. For 2024, Tomás predicts: “We’re going to see more scaled AI use cases, and a renewed interest in decommissioning legacy technologies so organizations can move ahead.” Inclusivity in telecommunications Inclusivity in telecommunications and protecting vulnerable individuals were also key topics. Jacky Wright , senior partner and chief technology and platform officer at McKinsey, took part in the panel. She said: “The broad takeaway was the notion of an ecosystem to solve this problem.” Gen AI has the potential to exponentially widen the digital divide, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. Mitigating this risk requires society to build a strong ecosystem where we each play an active role. This means government, private and public sectors, and NGOs working together. As Jacky put it, “What are the policies that need to be instituted? And in the absence of policies, what role should companies play in ensuring safety for vulnerable communities and individuals?” Still, it’s important to keep in mind that one solution will not fit for everyone. Jacky stated that the intersectionality—or how social identities interact—of inclusivity is required to solve the problem. “It is not as simple as saying, ‘Okay, we are going to limit access to a ten-year-old.’ Because the potential vulnerabilities of the ten-year-old in Michigan are very different from a ten-year-old in Yemen.” She also noted that given the potential for Gen AI to spread misinformation or manipulate the types of information that people have access to or consume, there is a stronger responsibility for governments to collaborate with the private sector and other facets of society to maintain the integrity of information. “We are starting to see governments play a more active role in learning, understanding the implications, and ultimately adopting policies that will protect vulnerable communities—in particular, in the US, UK, and the EU. So, I think we will start to see shifts: we need to act.” The future of telecommunications “In so many ways, this industry is the backbone of the global economy. Without it, many of the services that we use today for healthcare, transportation, and education would not exist,” observes Venkat. “Which is why it’s so important that the industry capture its fair share of that value.” To do so, Venkat said that “across regions, different players are going down different paths.” Some are looking at areas adjacent to the telecommunications industry, like media content. Others are insuring products they sell, such as mobile devices and home security. Still others are considering shifting from a telco to a techco, or technology company, and reimagining what they do. Venkat added, “And I think there is a realization that there’s no one right or wrong answer. It really depends on what context the organization is in.” One thing, however, is clear. As Venkat put it, “It’s quite exciting, and I can’t wait to take stock 12 months from now and see what progress we have made.” related Mobile World Congress 2023: Collaborating for a new era of innovation and inclusive growth Never miss a story"

The first step to any transformation is documenting how your processes function and interact today. But many leaders don’t have visibility into how complex their businesses are. How do you visualize a process that spans tens of thousands of locations? Has accumulated apps through years of mergers and acquisitions? And produces multiple versions of the same data? For the last two years, McKinsey has collaborated with Celonis, a pioneer and global leader in process mining, to help clients do exactly this: visualize what is “under the hood” of their organizations. This week, McKinsey is pleased to formalize our alliance. “When you have that Celonis visual in front of you, it's a very powerful thing. Companies can begin to understand the complexity of their business—the issues they work around every day—and address those inefficiencies toward greater productivity,” says Jan Wüllenweber , a McKinsey senior partner. “It enhances the speed and accuracy of any transformation.” “Together, McKinsey and Celonis give organizations the business and technical expertise they need to outrun today’s global macroeconomic challenges,” says Bastian Nominacher, co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis. “I’m always impressed by the value customers are able to unlock with McKinsey guiding their business transformation based on process insights.” “Our platform delivers end-to-end visibility into business processes—a data-driven, system-agnostic digital twin enriched with process intelligence,” explains Fabian Baldauf, senior director at Celonis. “This is coupled with McKinsey’s deep industry and organizational knowledge, and proven expertise in running transformation programs for its clients.” Headquartered in Munich and New York City, Celonis was established in 2011 when its three co-founders, who met during a consulting project at university, decided to commercialize process mining and to start a company. Today, it has more than 3,000 employees, a $13 billion valuation, and leads one of the fastest-growing segments of the global IT market . When you have that Celonis visual in front of you, it's a very powerful thing. Companies can begin to understand the complexity of their business—the issues they work around every day—and address those inefficiencies toward greater productivity. Celonis technology can visualize a company’s end-to end-processes, no matter how sprawling or complex, and highlight bottlenecks and inaccurate data. The cloud-based tool connects to an organization’s IT systems such as ERP, SCM and CRM systems. It captures the data from every split second of a process and extracts a digital footprint, creating a complete representation (a digital twin), similar to a subway map, of how the processes actually run. It is fact-based rather than anecdotal and can be created in days rather than weeks. Operations As little as three years ago, a team of experts would spend the first month of a project interviewing stakeholders, crunching data sets into spreadsheets, and recreating process flows on rolls of brown paper with markers and Post-its. “Some projects actually took up entire hallways,” recalls Julian Fischer , a McKinsey partner. “But when you have something as complex as an order-to-cash function with millions of transactions, you can only capture a sliver of the depth of such a process. You hope to find the most important variations...but you can’t be fully exhaustive—or objective. Companies normally are blown away when we present the Celonis visuals, what we often call a 'treasure map' of insights.” Samarth Shah , a McKinsey asset leader, explains a recent procure-to-pay project. In the first step, the McKinsey procurement experts identified the high-value use cases: where in the process can we make the greatest improvement? Illustration of various process-mapping steps from start to finish In step two, the Celonis analysts finetuned and connected the tool to the client’s platform. “It can do a deep dive to visualize root causes and typically solves for a specific problem,” he says. Then our experts interpret the data, define what best-in-class is, and develop a plan for change. “Many fixes can be automated in the workflows; others through updating organizational processes and building capabilities,” he points out. “Once in place, the power comes from applying the tool across multiple functions.” The technology is increasingly being used to analyze and decarbonize functions, and to support gen AI projects by providing the process-related data, knowledge and intelligence needed to run large language models (LLMs). Recently, a team helped a North American automotive original equipment manufacturer squeeze even greater efficiency out of one of their highest-performing sites. They wanted to reduce production cost per car; they already had mature lean manufacturing processes that produced high-quality, high-volume data. The team mapped virtual process streams for 100,000 cars, discovering that repairs were a source of inefficiency. They identified actions that could result in a 20 percent performance improvement. The diagnostic also revealed that cars had been looping back and forth among different repair bays—which the company hadn’t realized—adding days to production. The project was completed in six weeks. related McKinsey welcomes SES, experts at estimating capital projects Never miss a story"

March 26, 2024 Where did the world have its “lightbulb moment”? New York City, literally. In 1882, many were skeptical of a new technology, the lightbulb, and favored kerosene lamps. But Thomas Edison, backed by J.P. Morgan, showed the world the future when he lit up New York City buildings through electrification for the first time. “Will it work? Is it a good investment? Many weren’t sure,” Yael Taqqu , senior partner and managing partner of McKinsey’s New York office, told the crowd assembled at McKinsey’s second Future of NY Summit. The summit, held at the Morgan Library & Museum, once Morgan’s home and Edison’s laboratory, addressed similar questions about a current disruptive technology—generative AI. “Some of us will be skeptics, urge caution and safeguards, and others will push the boundaries of what is comfortable. We need both viewpoints to find a way forward for New York with AI.” The summit gathered leaders of corporations, startups, nonprofits, academia, and government to discuss challenges and opportunities facing New York City. This year, led by Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams, the summit built on new research from McKinsey into how generative AI will affect New York . Over one million occupational shifts may be required by 2030, with a third directly attributable to AI. Work that relies on knowledge or content creation will be up to 30 times more impacted than physical work. Governor Hochul credited this research for helping her prepare for the headwinds, which included founding the new Emerging Technology Advisory Board, an independent group of industry leaders led by Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, and Dr. Tarika Barrett, CEO of Girls Who Code, tasked with informing and accelerating New York’s transformation into a hub for growth and innovation. Some of us will be skeptics, urge caution and safeguards, and others will push the boundaries of what is comfortable. We need both viewpoints to find a way forward for New York with AI. Just as Edison’s light show heralded changes far beyond its host city, AI’s effect on New York will happen in a global context. A panel moderated by Nick Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, turned its attention to the technology’s wider implications. Throughout the panel, Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, called out the urgent need for technologists to develop AI for the public good, warning of potential social and economic consequences of business as usual. “The systems in the analog world that created and perpetuate inequality are prepared to reproduce it here unless there is intervention,” he says. “Technologists must not only study ethics but pursue careers in public service and government.” Barnard College president Laura Rosenbury echoed this by highlighting that 30 percent of jobs put at risk by AI are typically held by women, such as assistants, and that if AI is not trained on diverse populations, it won’t serve them either. She pointed to the role of academic institutions, noting that science and ethics classes are mandatory for Barnard students; however, “We need AI literacy starting in kindergarten if we aren’t going to leave people behind,” she says. One panelist came out as a slightly unenthusiastic technology adopter—co-founder and co-chairman of The Carlyle Group, David Rubenstein, jokingly wished he still used a BlackBerry. Despite his personal resistance, he was clear that everyone must have access to new technologies. “Our world is powered by technologies that didn’t exist when we were born, and the wealth gap was smaller before them,” he says. “If we’re not careful, AI will increase this disparity.” Rubenstein and Rosenbury stressed that AI cannot replace the human touch; business and education require personal communication and empathy to succeed. Rosenbury pointed to philosophy as critical to navigating and understanding the changes AI will bring. “In 20 years, we’ll be relying so much on philosophy to guide us through technology that the two fields might not have the same distinction,” she says. Thankfully, coming together to make our region stronger is what New Yorkers do best. John Legend, the singer-songwriter who was once a management consultant, recently joined a small group of artists who chose to embrace the AI future. They’ve licensed their voices to a YouTube program that allows users to create songs through AI . “The songs I sing are connected to my life and my life story, and that’s not replaceable by AI,” he says. “But AI will reach everyone as a co-writer, a thought starter, for all sorts of creative projects in the future, whether a song or ad copy.” John also mused about how AI can be a useful tool that can democratize access to creation and build community. “We should prioritize intentional investment in community and human capital and figure this all out collectively,” he says. “Thankfully, coming together to make our region stronger is what New Yorkers do best.” Never miss a story"

Gen AI has permeated our lives and promises to be the transformative technology of our time. We’re experiencing a whirlwind pace of innovation, meaning companies can no longer rely on choosing to build or buy off-the-shelf solutions as they look to implement and scale. To outcompete in today’s environment — as gen AI becomes more complex with new modalities like video, audio, text, and the technology’s increasingly refined level of reasoning — companies need to move from proof of concept to production at scale. Creating value beyond the hype However, 90 percent of pilots fail to reach full production. As we enter the next chapter of this massive technology shift, companies need collaborators to help them address the complexities of adopting and scaling gen AI. “Enterprises need to get many elements right simultaneously — address unstructured data, develop advanced algorithms, build the right IT architecture, drive capability building, change management, and domain expertise, to name a few,” explains Ben Ellencweig , a senior partner who leads alliances, acquisitions, and partnerships globally for QuantumBlack , the AI consulting arm of McKinsey. “Few can do this on their own, and that’s why tapping into the multi-billion-dollar AI and gen AI space through collaborations is critical.” Our ecosystem is the solution our clients need to adopt and scale gen AI. Business leaders see the increasing value of accessing the resources and cutting-edge technology from gen AI providers that will lead to value and drive domain transformation. Our ecosystem is the central hub for our clients to leverage expertise and solutions from 19 technology strategic alliances across all parts of the technology stack—from cloud infrastructure to LLM providers and encompassing topics like MLOps, data architecture, and capability building. “An ecosystem is the best way to stay current and win in this space; it moves too quickly for prior conventional methods,” explains Ellencweig. Our ecosystem is open and distinctive by design. To meet our client’s needs and aspirations, we adopt an open architecture: we build strategic alliances with leading players across all major technology stacks and work hand-in-glove with them to customize solutions and capture business value. Through this approach, we bring together the most cutting-edge technologists in the world — including long-standing large tech companies and bleeding-edge niche players — and McKinsey’s world-class assets, including recent acquisitions such as Candid for cloud computing, Caserta for data architecture, and Iguazio for machine learning and foundational model ops. Our ecosystem builds on McKinsey’s long-standing collaborations with AWS, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, and SAP by adding gen AI as a critical, innovative component of our work together. With such a wide array of leading tech providers in our ecosystem, we can give clients the best innovation across all dimensions of gen AI.

The alliance plays a key role in McKinsey’s open ecosystem of leading gen AI innovators , which provides clients with expertise and solutions across all parts of the technology stack so they can adopt and scale. Creating value beyond the hype McKinsey has already helped leading companies across a spectrum of industries and technical domains transform how they operate with Google Cloud’s trusted infrastructure and technology, including with gen AI. Projects have helped clients become more productive, streamline complex processes, and optimize value from their AI investments. For example, McKinsey and Google Cloud built a gen AI-powered search platform that significantly reduced maintenance times for a process manufacturer, and the companies developed a virtual agent that delivers highly personalized, instantaneous service to banking customers to resolve inquiries faster and more effectively. Google Cloud offers many of the industry’s leading cloud and AI technologies, and AI has been part of Google’s DNA since its inception. Combining the company’s exceptional product and engineering talent with its foundation models and AI frameworks provides the world’s largest enterprises with the tools and infrastructure they need to transform their businesses and improve operations at global scale. With their mindset of innovation and ability to work across the Alphabet businesses, Google Cloud is helping businesses solve their toughest challenges no matter how complex they may be. McKinsey brings a deep pool of talent to the alliance: The firm–including its gen AI arm, QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey –has 7,000 technologists, designers, and product managers serving clients in more than 50 countries. Many of these colleagues are Google Cloud-certified, with an approximately 160 percent increase in Google Cloud-certified individuals from last year. Through our work with more than 200 clients, we have quantified the core elements required for rewiring organizations and creating impact through AI-based transformation. QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey “When Google Cloud technology is combined with McKinsey’s industry expertise,  technology delivery experience, and capability building, it creates a powerful partnership able to help businesses shape, mobilize and orchestrate large-scale, tech-enabled transformations,” said Bob Sternfels , McKinsey's global managing partner. “Generative AI can transform organizations by increasing workforce productivity, accelerating developer velocity, and streamlining business operations,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. “With this expanded partnership, clients will now be better positioned to successfully scope and optimize their generative AI projects.” McKinsey estimates that there is more than $4 trillion in value to be unlocked by gen AI and cloud technologies. Through the alliance with Google Cloud, we are working with clients to capture this value in four ways: through cloud-enabled business transformations, tech modernization programs, gen-AI-enabled solutions, and industry-specific use cases. For example, in just a matter of weeks, our QuantumBlack data scientists partnered with Google Cloud’s generative AI solutions team to build two gen AI chatbots for Formula E racing . With Vertex AI and Google Cloud’s large language models, they produced real- time car performance data, helping the driving team set a world record for indoor land speed, and created the “voice of the car,”  allowing fans to experience racing as never before. A world record for Formula E, propelled by McKinsey’s AI We also jointly helped a process manufacturer pilot two high-impact generative AI use cases: an AI-enabled search platform for operations and a corporate research tool. Experts and engineers from QuantumBlack worked with Google Cloud architects and engineers to design and build these use cases, improving productivity and reducing costs. In all of our alliances, we look for companies who share the same commitment to creating impact for clients that we do. This one is no exception. “The partnership is a testament to our belief in this technology and our dedication to leading the charge in unlocking tangible value for our clients,” says Adrian Booth , leader of Build by McKinsey and the Google Cloud alliance. “This is not just an alliance,” Adrian adds. “It's a journey towards redefining the future of business, innovation, and success.” related McKinsey’s ecosystem of strategic alliances brings the power of generative AI to clients McKinsey named a Leader in Digital Transformation Services by Forrester Never miss a story"
"McKinsey accelerates growth for Bottom Line, a nonprofit boosting graduation rates","Bottom Line has served first-generation college students for 27 years. With McKinsey&rsquo;s help, it is primed to expand its reach to thousands more students.",2024-04-12T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/mckinsey%20helps%20boost%20organization%20with%20proven%20ability%20to%20increase%20college%20graduation%20rates/bottomline-hero-small-1536x864.jpg,"Diversity,Education",https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-accelerates-growth-for-bottom-line-a-nonprofit-boosting-graduation-rates,"McKinsey accelerates growth for Bottom Line, a nonprofit boosting graduation rates April 12, 2024 Bottom Line is reaching new heights. The nonprofit organization is dedicated to increasing college graduation rates of first-generation students from low-income backgrounds. Founded in 1997, it currently serves 7,000 students and operates in Boston, Chicago, and New York City. Its ambition is to reach over 20,000 students annually, and it has the momentum to get there: A study published in 2021 found that students working with Bottom Line had a 23 percent higher graduation rate in four years and 19 percent higher rate in six years than a control group. In 2022, MacKenzie Scott recognized the organization’s impact with a $15 million grant . But expansion can be fraught, especially for a national organization whose success is dependent on community partnerships. In addition, the pandemic threw a wrench in Bottom Line’s plans. It was a happy surprise, then, when McKinsey reached out to the organization in 2022 and suggested a pro bono partnership on a growth strategy. “Bottom Line had demonstrated that their model, centered on advising, was very effective,” says Ted Rounsaville , a McKinsey senior expert focused on advising universities on strategy and operations. “It was clear that this was the organization to partner with to make a difference in the lives of future college graduates.” Though Bottom Line had two expansion cities under its belt, according to Steve Colón , CEO  since 2018 and himself a first-generation college graduate, it was hoping to improve future rollouts. “In the past, we had essentially just shown up in a city and made it work. It wasn’t part of an overall plan,” he says. “What was really valuable in the partnership with McKinsey was we matured and professionalized our view of what is required to grow and expand the high-quality program that we have.” Opening a new location Bottom Line offers dedicated advising to high school seniors on the college application process and then support for up to six years during their studies. It partners with high schools to recruit students and has relationships with a network of local colleges that most students attend. Much of its funding comes from local sources. Putting all these elements in place requires careful choreography. “You can only move at the speed of relationships, and we want to go where we are invited in,” says Steven. With McKinsey’s guidance, Bottom Line hired centralized staff to explore new cities, look into new relationships, and build regional success guides. “In the past, we may have picked a location based on need without necessarily determining our ability to successfully replicate our model in that community. Now, if we get to a city and it becomes clear it’s not the right place for us—and we’ve had that happen—McKinsey’s process means we haven’t spent too many resources to get to that point,” Steven says. This deep groundwork led to identifying Dayton, Ohio , as the next expansion office, with services offered there, Cincinnati, and Columbus. New, regional staff members are in place, and recruiting for students is underway so services can begin this summer. If we get to a city and it becomes clear it’s not the right place for us—and we’ve had that happen—McKinsey’s process means we haven’t spent too many resources to get to that point. A new method of reaching students One of the lessons from the study that affirmed Bottom Line’s impact was the strength of its model. “The rigorous program model that Bottom Line has developed over the years is what drives its success,” says Ted. “We were excited about the potential for how the model could be brought to other organizations, reaching more students and creating a new revenue stream.” This was exciting to Steven, because “Bottom Line won’t be able to open in every community that needs it.” It created a training and capacity-building program for other professionals working with students on college success. Rolling it out would be uncharted business territory. “McKinsey helped bring this to market: identify our potential customers and target markets, and what profitability and sustainability look like,” Steven says. Ready for the future Still in its early stages, the training has reached around 200 people. But Steven is encouraged by what he has seen and is ready to step on the gas. What does that entail?  Although there are a few options for how to do this, what’s most important is that he feels the organization is well positioned to determine a path. “We’re in an iterative design phase for this rollout and all of our strategic work, and it’s all because we’ve made sound initial plans,” he says. “We’re learning and updating as we go.” To cement a culture and processes of planning, McKinsey provided Wave , one of the firm’s platforms for conducting large-scale transformations and benchmarking progress, and worked with Bottom Line’s senior leadership team on leadership skills, helping to build trust, cohesion, and performance across the organization. “It’s the type of capacity-building moment I’ve been wishing to bring to this organization for years,” says Steven.

Catalyzing tech-powered change in the race to decarbonization,Catalyst Zero integrates two decades of McKinsey&rsquo;s sustainability and industry expertise with leading-edge digital technology to deliver innovative decarbonization programs.,2024-04-19T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/catalyst%20zero%20helping%20decarbonize%20businesses/catalystzero-hero-small-1828489802-1536x864.jpg,Sustainability,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/catalyst-zero-helping-decarbonize-businesses,"Catalyzing tech-powered change in the race to decarbonization April 19, 2024 A major North American dairy cooperative wanted to establish a decarbonization program and a plan to rally their farmers. A global steel company was challenged by tracking over 800 decarbonization initiatives. A private equity firm needed a tool to monitor its portfolio companies for Scope 3 emissions compliance. Over the past 18 months, our sustainability experts have been using Catalyst Zero to help organizations such as these develop and implement innovative, fact-based decarbonization plans. Catalyst Zero is a digital platform—part analytics engine, part deep IP library—that integrates McKinsey’s sustainability expertise, industry technical know-how, and transformation experience. Using Catalyst Zero, we’ve served more than 100 organizations at different points in their journeys. Some projects map out a first-time carbon footprint or pressure-test existing plans and targets, while others involve rolling out decarbonization roadmaps across multiple locations, including organizational change and capability building. “What sets Catalyst Zero insights apart from other tools is the financial analysis: we help clients understand the capital and operating expenses of each option within their plan,” explains Miquel Ferrer , a solution manager. “This is crucial because once you have the strategy, the next step is to garner support across the broader organization to secure funding for the plan.” Catalyst Zero The first step of any project is specifying the datasets that can be used to convert all client activity, such as fuel for heating buildings, into a baseline measure across Scope 1,2, and 3 emissions . “This can be challenging as many clients don't have the right data in place to start,” points out Tim Vroman , a senior asset leader. “Our decarbonization experts and analytic tools help them make sense of their unstructured data and identify emission hotspots.” Once the baseline is established, the engine sorts through Catalyst Zero’s proprietary Decarbonization Lever Library, matching the most effective abatement actions to each type of emission. “The library is really at the heart of Catalyst Zero. It contains detailed business cases including required investment, additional expenses, and expected savings for more than 1,200 carbon abatement technologies associated with every single material, every single process emission out there,” explains Tim.  “It's constantly updated, on a regional basis, to ensure we are advising clients of the most effective action available.” The library is really at the heart of Catalyst Zero. It contains detailed business cases… for more than 1,200 carbon abatement technologies. It can produce a plan and related financials in as little as a week, including roadmaps for product design and procurement processes. One CTO recently remarked: “It is unbelievable that you can do in two days what takes my R&D team several months.” Earlier this year, a major beverage producer had publicly set ambitious decarbonization targets and wanted help in thinking through how to achieve them. As a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company, most of their emissions were in Scope 3—with their upstream suppliers, who provide the various ingredients they use. “We built a very granular view of their value chain evaluating the key inputs to their products to identify hotspots for emissions,” outlines Barnabas Gulyas , a solution associate.  “For example, sugar is a key ingredient, and we examined the sugar processing that took place before it reached their factories:  what are the sorts of fertilizers used and the level of greenhouse gases they contained? What kind of energy is being used during the crystallization process? What materials are used in the packaging?” The team created a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) that included all of the abatement levers to help the client understand where the best opportunities were to invest—or co-invest with their suppliers—to reduce the emissions. The analysis also highlighted no-regret moves such as using one of the by-products of sugar processing, bagasse, a biofuel, as an additional energy source. “We combined it with a market view of their suppliers—for example, how ready were they to engage?—to help clients strategize the kind of conversations they could have,” says Barnabas. An assessment often yields surprises. A client who produces industrial machinery had never calculated the “downstream” emissions created by their products once they leave the factory.  These are especially difficult to analyze—and they amounted to over 80 percent of their baseline. “This was a surprise, and would become an important part of their abatement strategy,” recalled Tim.  “But we were able to project that the emission sources will actually come down significantly as grids in different geographies adapt green electricity sources—this insight was only possible by having such a granular transparent analysis.” related McKinsey launches Catalyst Zero to help clients find and remove carbon across their businesses Never miss a story"
A new McKinsey look at the role of productivity in sustainable growth,Our newest MGI report makes the case for investing in productivity growth as the means for addressing our generational challenges.,2024-04-23T00:00:00,https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/new%20mgi%20research%20will%20we%20invest%20in%20productivity%20to%20thrive/mgi-productivity-hero-small-1143715629-14536x864.jpg,McKinsey Global Institute,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/new-mgi-research-will-we-invest-in-productivity-to-thrive,"A new McKinsey look at the role of productivity in sustainable growth April 23, 2024 Our newest McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report, Investing in productivity growth , looks at the factors that drive productivity to understand why it has slowed down. “This report does not run hundreds of pages like our earlier ones did,” laughs Chris Bradley , director and senior partner at MGI. “But it takes MGI’s same micro-to-macro approach to understanding productivity, the foundation of prosperity.” The report offers a big-picture view: grouping 118 countries into three lanes of growth—fast, middle, and slow—over the past 25 years. “This is one of the unsung, good news stories,” says Chris. “Median country productivity jumped sixfold over the past quarter century; salaries per worker grew from $7,000 to $41,000. This is a massive leap and we studied the extraordinary impact this has had in our Pixels of progress .” In this post, Chris; Jan Mischke , an MGI partner, and Marc Canal , an MGI senior fellow, share their findings. In simple terms, what does productivity measure, and why is it important? Chris: Technically speaking, it is measured as GDP, or the amount of value created by each hour of work in a society. How many parts does one employee produce? How valuable is the information a service rep provides? It’s about getting more value and traction from our work in the same number or fewer hours. Investing in productivity growth Productivity is not like a miasma that’s in the air where everyone does a little bit. It rolls in waves through industries. And you cannot miss it—like the dot-com boom we saw in the 1990s created by forces such as the rise of digitization; the modernization of supply chains by big box retailers, such as Walmart; the impact of Moore’s law, making chips faster and cheaper. Rising prosperity—a higher standard of living—can come only from productivity growth in the long run. What should readers take away from this research? Marc: To me, it’s the fact that investment is so clearly the determining factor in growing productivity. For example, the current “fast lane” growth economies (China, India, parts of Central and Eastern Europe, and emerging Asia) have a high level of investment in productivity, at 20 to 40 percent of GDP. They channeled it into improving infrastructure, urbanization, and technology. Fifty percent of global productivity growth has come from China and India alone, which is not surprising. But it has also come from other places: Central and Eastern Europe and parts of emerging Asia like Vietnam and Bangladesh. If they maintain their pace, they could catch up—or “converge”—with the living standards of advanced economies. The dream of universal prosperity is real here. “Slow lane” economies, largely in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, have consistently underinvested and hence fallen behind. But slow productivity is partially of our own making; investing is something that we can decide to do—and that’s what we hope leaders take away from this. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, there has been a sharp, universal slowdown in productivity and investment, especially in advanced economies. What does this mean? Jan: Even the United States, which had the highest labor productivity growth over the past 25 years, has only been at 1.6 percent per year. European economies ranged from 0.3 percent in Italy—close to 0—up to 1.0 percent in Germany or the United Kingdom, which is not great; and there is tremendous uncertainty here in terms of energy and competitiveness. We never fully recovered from the massive slowdown following 2008. There was less investment—relative to accelerating employment growth—in building new plants or updating machinery and equipment. Only intangibles such as R&D and software held up. Without the gains that come from improving productivity, we won’t be able to address our generational challenges: raising overall living standards, managing the net-zero transition, and addressing the needs of aging populations. What is the outlook now? Marc: There is reason for optimism, at least in the United States. Investment is picking up in a hot economy with full employment. Five US tech giants invested about $350 billion in R&D and capital expenditures in 2022 as part of a race to dominate in AI and cloud technologies. These are significant numbers: more than half of all EU public and private R&D combined. AI could increase corporate profits by $4.4 trillion a year, according to new research How will advances in AI impact productivity? Chris: We believe we’ll see an absolute revolution in services and productivity; it will be an extraordinary thing that changes the world. AI could add between 0.2 and 0.7 percentage points to productivity growth by transforming how jobs are done. AI replaces human activity. As people move to higher value work, we will still get the activity, but we won’t have to do the hours, so there is a huge productivity dividend. Can you put this macroeconomic view in perspective with our own work? Chris: Overall, productivity is a really important topic for our firm. So much of our work is about helping organizations improve performance through technology, skill building, and organizational change. Productivity drives human prosperity—and our aspirations and efforts to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. related Will productivity and growth return?

This was the approach that powered the firm’s launch of McKinsey Academy in 2014, aiming to make fundamental improvements in employees’ skills and capabilities and catalyze organizational changes and growth. Ten years later, McKinsey Academy has reached over one million people at 3,000 companies in 80 countries. The programming changes working mindsets and behaviors, develops leadership, management, and enterprise-wide transformation skills, and builds functional capabilities. Participants come from all industries and sectors, including those joining pro bono from nonprofits and through firm-run, no-cost skill-building initiatives, such as Connected Leaders Academy . Marc Metakis , a partner in New York City, was part of the team that initially conceived and launched McKinsey Academy. He shares how it started, its secret sauce, and what’s ahead. How did McKinsey Academy begin? In 2013, massive open online courses were everywhere, and we saw the powerful desire people had to keep building their skills. The firm’s capability building offerings were mostly focused on in-person workshops for senior leaders. How could we scale this to entire organizations? I helped lead a team to look at what we could build for clients. We talked to a lot of firm alumni and asked, “What would be most valuable for you and your organization? What do you need that you’re not getting?” We started with around 100 ideas and whittled them down to four core areas: strategy, communications, problem solving, and team management. We built up a lot of buy-in and excitement in the firm and launched to clients in 2014. How were courses initially set up and how did they evolve? We wanted to offer something unique to clients, beyond simple digital modules. We focused on multi-modal delivery, incorporating a blended approach with a mix of in-person workshops, digital modules, individual and group projects, simulations, and integrated impact measurement for skills development and behavior change. We leveraged our McKinsey IP, focusing on areas where we are truly distinctive, and combined that with the latest science on adult learning and behavioral science. Our emphasis on the social learning aspect really differentiated us from many of the other offerings in the market. Of course, when COVID-19 happened, we again transformed the programs to be fully remote and guided companies on moving their operations online. Over time we’ve actively evolved the portfolio from this core set of McKinsey tools, such as the McKinsey Management Program to really focus on the mindsets, behaviors, and skills that our clients need. So, in addition to our signature offerings addressing key leadership and execution essentials, such as Ability to Execute , we’ve built out a series of functional programs supporting digital and analytics; operations; and growth, marketing, and sales. What is our approach to fostering behavior change? When employees feel valued and special, they are more open to change. They need to see that the company is investing in them—and that starts with the very first communication employees receive. We make sure to engage senior leaders to send this message and to role model the changes where possible. We also help participants understand what’s in it for them and can gather peer feedback on their observed behaviors pre- and post-program and compare the change to quantify the impact the programs are having. What was a moment where the impact of the program resonated with you? Our impact goes beyond individual capabilities, but to culture and mindset shifts that an individual takes to everyone they work with. Our Ability to Execute Essentials program often changes the way an organization speaks and works. One financial services executive told me of seeing this in action, with employees talking in the hallways about prioritizing their “big rocks,” or large tasks, and about conducting pre-mortems to de-risk projects. The investment in employees also doesn’t go unnoticed: participants at one client saw a 14 percent higher retention rate compared to their colleagues. Our impact goes beyond individual capabilities, but to culture and mindset shifts that an individual takes to everyone they work with. Multiply a million learners rippling this out to people in their lives—that’s really the scale of impact. What’s something you’re excited about for the future of McKinsey Academy? We’re diagnosing needs within companies more surgically now so we can take a more modular, customized approach. We have around 20 signature offerings that are end-to-end capability building journeys, but what are the five or six skills that are most important for a specific client? Now we’re building skills-based diagnostics and can package the most relevant skills together very quickly and easily in a way that still has a cohesive narrative arc for program participants. Of course, generative AI is a foundational pivot. We’re working with our firm’s generative AI experts on integrating a “coach” that will provide real-time feedback in our problem-solving course to help push participants’ thinking on their problem statements, and a personal performance support co-pilot integrated directly into day-to-day flows of work. Imagine, for example, receiving a notification to remind you to share a clear and structured agenda in advance of your next meeting. As we continue to apply the science of adult learning with the latest technological innovations, our work has shown that the potential for generative AI is huge and very exciting.
